Bali s elaborate masks offer a connection to the gods This mask of the character Patih Manis was carved from lightweight pule wood by Ida Bagus Anom Suryawan a sixth generation artisan in Bali Masks like these are integral to sacred dance dramas performed on the Indonesian island MAGAZINE Bali s elaborate masks offer a connection to the gods Costumed dances and visits with artisans reveal the complex culture and traditional crafts of the Indonesian island By Narina Exelby Photographs by Francesco Lastrucci March min read Wearing the face of Patih Manis above a character in Bali s dance dramas means more than simply putting on a tapel or mask When you dance with a tapel and perform its character you undergo a transformation says I Made Bandem a scholar and professor of Balinese arts and a dancer for seven decades You must marry that mask and make ritual offerings to create unity between yourself and the tapel Many dancers will sleep with the mask beside them so that they can learn its true character Hand carved tapel are integral to Topeng Pajegan and Topeng Panca dance dramas often held at temple festivals and family rituals across this Indonesian island The masks along with elaborate costumes hypnotic music and staccato movements sometimes only of the fingers have enchanted Balinese audiences since the century Maskmaker Ida Bagus Anom Suryawan and his wife Ayu sit in the courtyard of their house and workshop in the Balinese village of Mas known for its wood carving The traditional wooden mask he s holding is a work in progress The stories staged in Pajegan and Panca tell the history of the Balinese people and the characters never change Their appearance movements roles and even the order in which they emerge remain the same Yet in spite of this structure topeng leave room for a great deal of artistic freedom With no script and no prescribed musical arrangement the entire performance which can last around four hours will be an improvisation dancers and musicians drawing cues from one another Bali has a rich legacy of performing arts and the earliest record of mask dances on the island dates back to A D The various forms of dance gamelan a traditional ensemble and shadow puppetry each have their own function the most basic of which is to please the deities and while they are integral to religious ceremonies some performances and types of dramas are considered more sacred than others Most of the dances that tourists watch like the k ecak dance at Uluwatu Temple and the b arong tourist version in Batubulan are not the sacred ones says Brazilian performer Allegra Ceccarelli who has studied Balinese dance and culture under some of the island s most revered masters since You will only be able to see truly sacred dances if you go to a real temple ceremony where there are so many aspects that contribute to the spiritual performance When a dance is taken out of the ritual environment it becomes just a dance Here s how to delve deeper into this quintessential Balinese art form The spirit of the mask Every sacred mask carved here in Bali has its own spirit says acclaimed sixth generation maskmaker Ida Bagus Anom Suryawan If the mask dancer has observed all of the necessary offerings and ceremonies and they have been disciplined in their training then when a dancer puts on the mask for a performance their body will usually become a medium for the spirit Suryawan who is also a mask dancer and skilled puppeteer works on his carving on the veranda of his home near Ubud The town lies halfway between Bali s volcanic peaks and the sea and is often described as the island s cultural and artistic heartland Masks are generally crafted from the pule tree Alstonia scholaris using tools like the pangot knife Ida Bagus Anom Suryawan holds a mask he made depicting the Rangda White a demon queen from Balinese Hindu mythology It s believed that every mask used for performance has a spirit From piñatas to masks papier mâché crafts bring the party in Mexico Despite the town s popularity with travelers the air around Ubud is still often laced with delicate tendrils of incense and the sidewalks are scattered with canang sari the floral offerings made daily to the Hindu gods Ubud s streets packed with vehicles and tourists are lined with jewelry stores art stalls clothing boutiques and shops selling wooden sculptures Booths sell tickets for performances of the kecak fire dance or mystical barong dance Tucked away behind intricately carved walls enchanting galleries house works by some of the island s most revered artists While numerous artists have now turned their inherited crafts into a revenue source the art and performances that until almost a century ago were almost always created only for ritual purposes still remain integral to Balinese Hindu society To the Balinese people a sacred mask for example is far more than an ornamental piece of timber and a masked dance is not simply a spellbinding spectacle Both provide a means to connect with the gods and ancestors and offer a living breathing union with niskala the unseen world Ceremonies which must include participation in music and dance are still very much a part of our lives says Bandem A new moon ceremony at a private house near Ubud in central Bali involves a Topeng dance drama performed by a masked dancer accompanied by gamelan music The cultural center of Bali Historically the royal families of Bali s nine kingdoms served as patrons of the arts and there were thriving centers all across the island But by early last century when most of the kingdoms had fallen to Dutch colonizers many of Bali s artists sculptors and architects had found refuge in Gianyar the kingdom now regency to which Ubud belongs By the Ubud
