What and where to eat in Singapore TRAVEL A taste of Singapore from fusion flavours to craft cocktails Singapore s food culture is as diverse as its population with Michelin starred restaurants innovative cocktail bars hawker stalls and family run zi char joints drawing on influences from China India Malaysia and beyond A centuries long mixing of influences has created a hybrid culture in Singapore with its own language art and of course cuisine Photograph by Getty Images By Karlina Valeiko May This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK The unmistakable aroma of coffee fills the room it s nutty and chocolatey with a pleasantly smoky quality I breathe it in before I see its origin a plate heaped with crispy chicken slathered in dark sticky coffee sauce It arrives at my table accompanied by a dish of golden butter cereal prawns and moonlight horfun stir fried beef noodles served with a raw egg in the middle I m at Keng Eng Kee Seafood affectionately known as Kek to its regulars The third generation family owned and run restaurant is one of Singapore s zi char cook fry establishments offering traditional Chinese Hokkien food with Malay and Indian influences served family style for everyone to share We re all immigrants here we ve all come from somewhere says my guide Naseem Huseni So it s not unusual to see typically Malay ingredients used in Indian dishes or saffron with noodles and so on This eclectic blending of flavours and convergence of traditions also manifests itself in Singapore s Peranakan culture A centuries long mixing of Chinese Malay and Indonesian influences has created a hybrid culture with its own cuisine language and art for many the highly decorated and colourful Peranakan houses are a symbol of Singapore Naseem explains that the complex and typically slow cooked dishes of Peranakan cuisine once out of fashion are enjoying a surge in popularity This is in no small part thanks to Candlenut which in became the world s first Peranakan restaurant to be awarded a Michelin star Its menu changes according to the season and is updated monthly When I visit a salad of sweetcorn peppery mizuna greens and Java apple with crispy anchovies and a dressing of sesame and gula melaka a type of palm sugar with a deep molasses like flavour is a zingy standout Its balance of sweet salty and piquant is the perfect counterpoint to the beef rendang that follows a melt in the mouth tender Malaysian stew and Candlenut s take on ikan gulai a fiery red snapper curry with mellow coconutty notes that are a balm to the dish s spicy burn The feast ends with buah keluak candlenut ice cream You know it can be highly toxic Naseem says laying out the consequences of an improperly prepared candlenut I take the leap anyway and shove a whole spoonful of the dessert into my mouth In skilled hands the nut imparts an earthy slightly bitter flavour akin to dark chocolate while sea salt caramel and chocolate chilli crumble add rich layers of flavour Made from a poisonous fruit that s only edible when fermented buah keluak ice cream is one of Candlenut s signature dishes Photograph by Audrey Mok Photography Hawker heaven High end dining is a huge part of Singapore s food culture During my visit I indulge in an omakase menu celebrating premium ingredients like Wagyu beef at Keyaki And try the mind boggling creations of chef Edward Chong at Peach Blossoms including an umami rich deep fried cigar of snow crab prawn mousse foie gras and black truffle and a dainty pastry crafted into the shape a bee and filled with flavourful honey But it s Singapore s hawker centres a local version of a food hall that really capture the essence of this city state We don t have a common history or traditions sometimes we don t even speak the same language explains Naseem So you have to wonder what is it that unites Singaporeans Any Singaporean will tell you that when they leave home they only miss one thing food Chicken rice is one of Singapore s most famous dishes consisting of poached chicken seasoned rice and some greens on the side Photograph by Danny Santos We re navigating the lunch crowd at Maxwell Food Centre near Chinatown and it isn t long before I m dazed by the choice on offer there are more than stalls here serving everything from simple yet hearty stir fried noodles and steamed cockles to complex seafood curries and a Singaporean signature chilli crab Naseem has her sights set on Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice and its feted dish of Hainanese chicken and rice What started as a frugal way to make chicken go a little further in less prosperous times is now a meal so popular it competes with chilli crab for the title of Singapore s national dish We have to brave a long queue to get our hands on it a deceptively simple combination of seasoned rice and tender poached chicken with some greens on the side often accompanied by dark soya sauce chilli garlic and ginger dips It s most Singaporeans comfort food of choice and while it might look rather plain to the eye its real secret lies in the skill of building the depth of flavour Recipes are often passed through generations and haven t changed in decades Naseem says also explaining that the real star of the dish is actually the rice cooked with chicken fat and stock from poaching the bird As I savour another mouthful of the fluffy rice topped with slices of juicy chicken fragrant with fresh garlic and ginger I wholeheartedly agree After hours Another unmissable element of Singapore s culinary patchwork is its cocktail culture And its threads stretch much further back than the or so years since creative craft cocktail bars started springing up across the city Singapore after all is the birthplace of the eponymous sling the cocktail created in the Long Bar at Raffles hotel in A rosy pink drink with an elegant foam top that resembles an innocent fruity punch the Singapore sling was invented so women could enjoy an alcoholic drink discreetly in a time when such hedonism wasn t socially acceptable Discarded peanut shells crunch underfoot as I m shown to a table Long Bar tradition has it that once you ve shelled your monkey nuts bags of which accompany each drink they re discarded on the floor Salty snack thus dispatched it s not long before I ve slung back the sling a sweet yet refreshing way to while away an hour or so on a hot and humid day The bar at Mama Diam is accessed via a secret door that s part of a mock mama shop Photograph by Mama Diam Created in for women to enjoy an alcoholic cocktail discreetly the Singapore sling is a sweet yet refreshing drink Photograph by Raffles Hotel Singapore Singapore s cocktail scene offers abundant choice its bars often weaving in stories of the city state in their historic locations and creative libations Mama Diam where I spend my final evening in the city is named after the sundry mama shops that occupy the ground floor of housing blocks built in the and I find its entrance masked speakeasy style by a mock shopfront where a secret sliding door opens to reveal the dim interior After a can of milk tea transformed into a creamy sweet cocktail of whisky and amaretto I head upstairs to find an elevator door At the press of a button the door opens and I step through and out the other side into another era Cafe cocktail bar Lou Shang has seating arranged along two countertops at the centre of what looks like a housing block laundry hung out to dry electricity meters plant pots and all The bar menu is similarly nostalgic organised into evocative categories such as coming home and staying home with home made noodles and comfort food favourites like chicken poppers and banana peanut cake When it s time to pack I have comfort food of my own to take home a jar of Kek s incredible house made coffee sauce gifted to me by one of its third generation owners Jiamin Liew Oh it s no problem please enjoy she d said with a generous smile
