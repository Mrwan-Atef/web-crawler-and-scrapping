codes are nearly nonexistent and the city s self aware laid back culture keeps formalities to a minimum But there are a few things a savvy traveler can do in advance to make the most of their time and

true You ll see people in situations wearing clothes that would have horrified their parents grandparents or maybe even their great grandparents The Bay Area is a casual place and while people aggressively dress down the opposite isn t unheard of Really anything goes so if you ve got a special outfit in mind by all means wear it for the appreciation of one and all Italian bistros and cafes

don t blame your server who may not directly benefit from the surcharge perhaps share your feedback with the owner or online Bay Bridge looking toward the San Francisco skyline Tim Miley Getty Images

streetcar in the Castro xavierarnau Getty Images San Francisco s public transport is an experience With notoriously bad traffic and parking that is either impossible or expensive most San Franciscans prefer to walk bike or ride share to get around Riding Muni is a great way to see San Francisco too Its historic streetcars and iconic cable cars double up as experiences and the buses and light rail trains provide access to most of the city But getting around by car Forget it Avoid driving until it s time to leave town San Francisco City Hall illuminated in rainbow colors in honor of Pride Week

Francisco streets have bicycle lanes and major parks have bike paths The safest places to cycle in SF are Golden Gate Park mostly car free on Sundays the Embarcadero Ocean Beach the Marina and the park like Presidio The city s cyclists are a proud lot and most will enthusiastically share advice with visitors who ask Know where to go know where to hold it Many toilets in public or shared spaces in San Francisco are designated for use by all genders denoted by a triangle All gender toilets usually have stalls instead of open urinals Busier areas of town will have public restrooms which are often used as a shelter by members of the city s unhoused community Accept the fact that you may need to buy coffee or a drink in a cafe so you can use a customers only toilet Lombard Street is known as the crookedest street in the world Vlad Siaber Shutterstock Leave nothing not even a map in your car Rental vehicles are targeted by gangs of thieves in San Francisco and videos of cops standing

those experiencing addiction Keep your city smarts and wits about you especially at night in SoMa the Upper Haight and the Mission If you re alone in these areas at night consider a ride share or taxi instead of waiting for a bus Avoid using your smartphone unnecessarily on the street â phone snatching happens The Bayviewâ Hunters Point neighborhood south of Potrero Hill along the water isn t suitable for wandering tourists due to policing and crime issues After dark some of the city s best green spaces like Mission Dolores Park Buena Vista Park and the entry to Golden Gate Park at Haight and Stanyan Streets are used for drug deals and prostitution If you re there at night you may get propositioned Though it s an area with many hotels the Tenderloin immediately west of Union Square and north of Market St suffers from all manner of social ills and can be uncomfortable for casual visitors both day and night It s inevitable that panhandlers will ask you for spare change especially
