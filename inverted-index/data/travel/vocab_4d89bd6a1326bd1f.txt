Sarah Clayton Lea Feb min read Share Sarah in her airport issue hazmat suit some of her meals were ordered from outside on the balcony of her hotel room where she spent days Â Sarah Clayton Lea With more countries introducing mandatory hotel quarantine for travelers arriving from other countries one writer who has just completed a day hotel quarantine in Vietnam shares her tips on how to get through it Wringing out my gym gear in a bathtub before hanging it on a thin piece of rope tied between a door and my hotel balcony is not how I imagined Iâ d be spending a Saturday night There was an interruption to get my temperature checked at on the dot I was expecting it as this is the norm in hotel quarantine It turned out to be just one of the many things that I had to get used to when I recently spent days quarantined in a hotel in Ho Chi Minh Vietnam Quarantine wasâ Weird Necessary And yes lonely It simultaneously went by oh so slowly and yet quite quickly Advertisement Saigon River in Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam Â Tony Nguyen One year ago following the initial outbreak of COVID Vietnam was one of the first countries to introduce mandatory quarantine for arrivals Even before recording its first case on the January Vietnam had already begun to issue public health warnings about this mysterious new virus They tightened borders in March suspending inbound tourist travel even now only business experts on government approved chartered flights and Vietnamese nationals on repatriation flights are allowed to enter All travelers need a PCR test between days in advance of flying and quarantine in an assigned facility is mandatory The current national COVID tally is at including deaths Vietnam has reacted fast to the pandemic with low official case numbers Â Nhac Nguyen AFP via Getty Images For a country that shares a large part of its land border with China their handling of the pandemic is impressive After the initial outbreak some second and third waves cropped up but each time Vietnam reacted fast locking down entire towns when required I was living here until March last year and was on a work trip to Thailand when Vietnamese borders shut I wasnâ t surprised to hear the news but I didnâ t expect to only be able to return to Ho Chi Minh months later Returning to Vietnam was time consuming I never want to hear the word notarize again and expensive I stayed put in Thailand while I made my plans to re enter which included booking a quarantine hotel for days at my own expense The cost of hotel quarantine There was a choice of government approved hotels to choose from and my requirement was simple which room would be least likely to make me lose my mind I chose a star hotel that cost me about â for nights For that price in Ho Chi Minh you could usually stay somewhere super swish During a global pandemic I had a room with twin single beds and a little desk that became my office and dining table for three meals a day Sarah had the option to choose her hotel and went for a three star in Ho Chi Minh city Â Sarah Clayton Lea Advertisement I arrived at the hotel late at night via pre approved private transport in my shiny new blue hazmat suit which I was handed on arrival at the airport Vietnam doesnâ t do things by halves when it comes to Covid protocol I checked in via QR code unpacked in my new home and wrote out a countdown of the days to be crossed off each morning I got through the first couple of days fine It would be just like having a duvet day for two whole weeks right Very wrong Workouts during hotel quarantine In my head I figured I would just keep busy with my editor work at bigseventravel com do a few workouts and time would fly In reality I was digging into my emergency stash of Tayto crisps by day three The only human contact I had was a temperature check twice a day and my two COVID tests I communicated with the hotel over Whatsapp and swapped cute emojis with the hotel receptionist on the group chat who I grew unnaturally fond of for dropping off my outside deliveries I felt like Joaquin Phoenix in Her but not as well dressed Comfort over glamour is quarantine The only exciting part of my day was receiving deliveries so I made good use of local food and shopping apps and online workouts with my weights and yoga mat were balanced out with some Emmental mac and cheese My first workout involved high knees and squat jumps the receptionist Whatsapped me to ask if I was OK â We just worry that there is something wrong with you â Nothing was right anyway Exercising in her hotel room drew the attention of guests on the floor below Â Sarah Clayton Lea Food deliveries and room service During my stay my room door had an alarm that went off whenever I opened it mainly to collect food that had been left on the table outside Room rate included daily breakfast which was a tasty variation of noodle soup breads cakes and fruit Strong coffee was served with condensed milk and ice proper cÃ phÃª sá a Ä Ã style Lunch and dinner I ordered from outside restaurants â Ho Chi Minh has incredible Vietnamese food options so I switched meals up each day You can receive items from outside but apart from rubbish nothing can leave the room during the quarantine period and no other person can come inside There were several plastic wrapped sets of fresh sheets and towels in the wardrobe â housekeeping isnâ t allowed to enter the room so I changed the bed covers myself I ordered cleaning supplies online to keep my room tidy and did my laundry in the bathtub Some of the daily breakfasts delivered to Sarah s room during her hotel quarantine Â Sarah Clayton Lea Work exercise Netflix repeat I had read some quarantine tips before I arrived so I tried to keep a normal ish routine Monday Friday sticking to a solid hours of work exercise dinner and Netflix Both weekends in quarantine were a bore I did yoga drawing reading and had a bath and it was still only on Saturday I tried to stay offline but ended up mindlessly scrolling on Bumble My friend drove to the hotel and waved to me from the street below dropping off a very welcome gift bag of snacks and sheet masks I did my nails Twice I felt the need to hear my own voice any voice would have done the trick actually and had regular loud sing songs to an Easy playlist on Spotify To whoever was unlucky enough to be staying next door in room Iâ m sorry I naively had high hopes of being really productive during the days smashing through work and brushing up on languages I wanted to improve my Italian and learn the basics of Vietnamese again but the only Vietnamese phrase I learned was please update network for the Smart TV and my quarantine Italian education was solely in the form of pasta I thought that with no distractions I would be able to focus better than ever but after just a week inside the same room I felt myself becoming a little foggy brained Having no distractions became a distraction itself Ho Chi Minh has incredible food options so Sarah ordered in for lunch and dinner Â xuanhuongho Shutterstock Staying connected Online tips for self isolation all mentioned the importance of checking in with loved ones so I tried my best to follow that advice Iâ m not a major fan of personal Zoom calls but I made an effort to keep in touch with friends and family so that I didnâ t feel too isolated I managed to get through the days with only one cry and a few stressed out cigarettes on the balcony which was way better than the total emotional meltdown I had half expected Being outside in the world was not as over whelming for Sarah as she expected Â Nhac Nguyen AFP via Getty Images I was due to get out on a Sunday once my final COVID test results came back but I wasnâ t told an exact time so the final hours stretched on forever as I waited for official release approval from the Health Department Yoga mat in hand I was free Being able to now settle into a country that feels safe and has such a good handle on the virus is a privilege and one well worth half a month of pretty cushy quarantine I had thought it would feel overwhelming being outside again in crowds but it was fine and I celebrated my release with friends on a rooftop bar just like nothing had ever happened I guess those two weeks of solitude had no lasting effect â apart from my love for that Easy playlist Editor s note during COVID there are restrictions on travel Check the latest guidance before departure and always follow local health advice You might also like The destinations with mandatory quarantines The most unusual food in Vietnam
