season June to September is hot and busy and the islandâ s tourist machine runs at full speed with holidaymakers flocking to Corfu in the hundreds of thousands Spring and autumn are quieter the weather is pleasantly warm and prices are reasonable While winters can be rainy itÊ s a good time to experience the islandâ s true colors interact with the locals and enjoy a truly authentic Greek experience Easter in particular is the best time to visit for an extraordinary cultural experience A week of sanctity and devoutness is followed by the triumphant mayhem of church bells and clay pots thrown from balconies and breaking on the alleysâ cobblestones below A thunderous cannonade from the fort is mixed with the sublime music of the islandâ s â no less â philharmonic orchestras creating an overwhelming atmosphere and celebrating the triumph of life over death The local carnival celebrations in February resemble those of Venice attracting large crowds and are a perfect opportunity for partying and all out reveling How much time should I spend on Corfu Visitors are guaranteed a rewarding stay whether it is for a long weekend or a full two week vacation The Old Town a UNESCO World Heritage Site is the perfect base if your time is limited Here you can lose yourself in the spectacular alleyways and piazzas admire the unique architectural blend visit the numerous museums savor local fare in small elegant restaurants and join the fun of the vibrant nightlife For a longer stay the island s lush nature and world class beaches offer a variety of different things to do ranging from outright relaxation to highly charged adventure Is it easy to get to and around Corfu Ioannis Kapodistrias is Corfuâ s international airport named after the first governor of Greece who was born on the island and there are many daily flights to and from Athens year round During the tourist season a continuous stream of chartered flights makes the airport one of the busiest in the country Advertisement There are daily ferry connections between Corfu and Igoumenitsa on the mainland and during the summer months the Italian cities of Brindisi Bari and Angona There are multiple daily connections to the other Ionian islands and Saranda Albania The public transport is excellent City buses blue and intercity KTEL green reach even the most remote villages and beaches of the island with extra services during the peak months Plenty of taxis offer a more flexible and comfortable but pricey means of transport However as in many large island destinations the best way to experience Corfu is to hire a car plenty of quality rental companies operate on the island A busy street during summer in Corfu Town Shutterstock Top things to do on Corfu There are a few unmissable sights even if you plan to stay on Corfu for a few days Even on the shortest stay on the island make time for a stroll in the labyrinthine kantounia alleys of the Old Town Stop for a leisurely coffee or a delicious kumquat liquer made with the celebrated local golden orange along the Liston the magnificent pedestrian arcade located on Greeceâ s largest public square the Spianada Achilleion Palace is a majestic building once home to Empress Elisabeth of Austria Sissy and Kaiser Wilhelm II Although the interior is undergoing restoration and is closed to the public its marvelous gardens and panoramic views of the town and the island are well worth a visit Wander the Old Fortress Palaio Frourio a magnificent Venetian construction built on a rocky peninsula â the old Byzantine capitalâ s site â that dominates the eastern part of the Old Town For nature loving and adventurous types the Corfu Trail is a more than mile route crossing the entire island from south to north It passes through villages both inland and on the coast where intrepid trekkers wishing to complete the trail can refuel and rest overnight For those with less time or stamina though any part of the trail is a rewarding acquaintance with the islandâ s pristine nature Corfuâ s mile coastline boasts countless stunning beaches and it is impossible to visit them all during a single stay There is a perfect match for every taste and preference ranging from long sandy stretches to tiny pebbly bays and overcrowded cosmopolitan spots to deserted coves The beaches nearby Palaiokastritsa Benitses Sidari Porto Timoni Agios Georgios Pagon and Ipsos are just some of the island s best beaches Romantic souls will absolutely adore the Canal d amour a psammite sandstone fjord with a wonderful tiny beach Legend has it that couples who swim in the canal stay in love forever Bring a diving mask with a snorkel and arrive early in the morning to secure a spot on the beach A secluded cove along Corfu s long coastline David C Tomlinson Getty Images My favorite thing to do on Corfu The highlight of my Corfu vacation is taking a cruise to some of the island s most beautiful and remote corners Especially during the summer the islandâ s superb beaches can get extremely busy so hiring a private small boat no need for a professional license is the ultimate escape from the crowds There are dozens of otherwise inaccessible bays and secluded small beaches especially along the northeastern coast between Kalami and Kasiopi and a day out there in the vast blueness with the bright sky above and the crystalline Ionian sea beneath is a treat for the senses Where to stay in Corfu On a budget Check out Yaliskari Beach Studios You need your own transport to reach this old school hideaway with balconied untis above a sweet little beach with a taverna run by the same family Spend more The modern Melina Bay Hotel sits below the castle with stunning views of Kassiopi s harbor front The snug nautical themed rooms have excellent amenities Spend the most Enjoy the city center at Bella Venezia A neoclassical villa on a peaceful street that features compact but well equipped rooms and a flowery breakfast terrace What local foods should I try Corfu cuisine boasts several mouthwatering recipes that visitors can savor exclusively on the island Top among them are sofrito a garlicky veal dish cooked in wine pastitsadha local pasta with chicken or beef seasoned with myriad spices and bourdeto fish cooked in a red spicy sauce What s the best day trip from Corfu Unspoiled by tourism may sound like a meaningless clichÃ but the three remote Diapontia islands of Othoni Erikousa and Mathraki on the northernmost corner of Greece have been unduly overlooked by travel guides and visitors Serene sandy beaches small villages and tranquil footpaths render the islands the perfect getaway from the bustling crowds There are regular daily connections by ferry caÃ que or skiff boat and private mini cruise How much money do I need for Corfu As in every other hugely popular destination accommodations and service prices peak during the busy months However Corfu offers choices for every budget from backpackers to high end
