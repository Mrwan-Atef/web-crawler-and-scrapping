Fishing and foraging in Norway s southern fjords TRAVEL Fishing and foraging in Norway s southern fjords With its glaciers fjords and craggy mountains Southern Norway is jaw droppingly beautiful And nature leads the region s chefs who draw on the bounties of the North Sea orchards and forests Preikestolen pulpit rock in Lysefjord is one of Norway s most scenic hiking spots Photography by Ruben Soltvedt By Kerry Walker October min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK An expectant hush falls as two knife wielding chefs in pristine whites emerge from behind the polished walnut counter at Sabi Omakase a Michelin starred restaurant in Stavanger Ziggy the sommelier tops up our glasses The show is about to begin Omakase means chef s choice he says smiling warmly Everything is prepared fresh before your eyes and you should eat each course immediately when served The curtain rises on a zingy king crab bejewelled finger lime soup that we re urged to slurp Then dish after dish appears on the counter the tiny restaurant s sole dining table seating just nine Silky halibut nigiri topped with caramelised onions salmon belly nigiri with a powerful punch of wild garlic umami packed bluefish tuna with marinated seaweed sweet raw shrimp flat oysters with salmon caviar a perfect langoustine with physalis and miso The chefs work swiftly and precisely with reverence for each ingredient as they fillet slice chop garnish glaze and blowtorch Roger Joya appears from behind the scenes to ask if we re enjoying the food This is Tokyo style Edomae sushi reimagined with regional ingredients The North Sea s cold waters are the dream full of incredible fish and seafood We stay true to Japanese traditions using sweet sticky Akitakomachi short grain rice as the base for our nigiri but we add our own twist river grown Nordic wasabi Norwegian Wagyu reindeer I call this Normae style he grins at his conflation of Norwegian and Edomae When Roger isn t running the kitchen he s out working with divers fishermen and fishmongers to ensure everything that arrives on his counter is of flawless quality I stumble out into the night walking off one the most memorable meals of my life as lights twinkle over the misty blues of Stavanger harbour Norway s fourth largest city made its fortune from the briny blue here in the country s south where the turquoise Lysefjord meets the North Sea In Stavanger s newly revamped cannery museum I learn how sardines kept the economy here going between the to the before North Sea oil landed the country the big bucks Today Stavanger has an appealing mix of tradition and edge home to more historic timber houses in pretty pastels than anywhere else in Norway and one of the most dynamic street art scenes in Europe too is served with cauliflower onions and fermented chilli emulsion at Fisketorget in Stavanger Photography by Fredrik Ringe If Stavanger has hovered under the radar compared to its westerly cousin Bergen things are changing The city is quietly asserting itself as a Norwegian culinary hotspot with chefs drawing on the bounty of the fjords fields mountains and forests At the pinnacle is two Michelin starred RE NAA where Sven Erik Renaa brings a foraged seasonal touch to dishes such as sea urchin with shrimp and green strawberries An Antony Gormley sculpture gazes out to sea in front of Fisketorget a waterfront fishmonger and bistro that dishes up whatever the fishing boats have landed that morning The counter brims with glossy prawns whole fish scallops oysters lobster and crab and there s a happy clamour in the dining room over lunch The creamy fiskesuppe is a real burst of the sea full of shrimp and flaky chunks of cod dressed with parsley oil and sprinkled with chives An open shrimp sandwich with pickled red onion and aioli is magnificent Stavanger is the springboard for Norway s southern fjords and the Norwegian Scenic Route Ryfylke offers an uplifting drive across fjord hopping bridges past crashing falls and flint blue lakes My first stop is Ryfylke Gardsysteri dairy farm in Årdal where forested hills bow to the sea and doe eyed Norwegian Red and Jersey cows graze There s traceability from roe to table says Mikal We dry salt our fish with nothing but sea salt and sugar smoking it over beech and juniper You ll find some of the world s best salmon here where the fjords are clean and deep The farm is the lockdown baby of Hilde and Joar Hauge Joar trained as a chef but gave it up because of the unsociable hours to become a farmer and now works all the hours under the sun he tells me with an ironic smile Our barn is next to our small cheese factory so it s straight from udder to vat explains Joar as we walk into a room stacked with pungent wheels of cheese We make our unpasturised cheese twice a week the traditional way It s wondrous There s gooey intensely aromatic ryfylkeosten a cream cheese as fine as anything in France semi ripe pøyg aged three to six months nutty manchego like trave and farr a crumbly powerfully flavoured slightly crystallised variety aged for a minimum of months Norwegian parmesan says Joar with a modest shrug Or better I think filling my bag The Bolder is one of Stavanger s standout holiday rentals Photography by Ruben Soltvedt From here it s a short sprint to Apal Sideri on the shores of Hjelmelandsfjord where white apple blossom sprinkles the slopes like bridal confetti In the heart of the orchard is a stylish new tasting room which Dan Olav Sæbø built it from scratch Back in the young Norwegian gave up carpentry to take over his family s century fruit farm He looked at all the wasted class two gravenstein summer red and aroma apples and thought cider In his first year he won gold for his crisp sparkling Sølvsider at the Frankfurt Cider World Awards much to the astonishment of many I thought I d start with the big one he beams cheekily He pours me a glass of rosé cider summer in a glass with a pop of raspberry It s delicious but the stunner is the ice cider complex honeyed and crisply appley it s a refreshing alternative to dessert wine He asks where I m off to next and I tell him I m going to see Mikal Viga a short ferry hop across the fjord Oh he s a real character he beams raising his eyebrows He s not wrong The self proclaimed king of salmon owner of Mikals Laks salmon smokery is a force of nature a big burly man who grew up on these shores He hails from a family with a long tradition of riding waves and smoking fish He was two when he first went sprat fishing on the Jøsenfjord When he started working for the family fish farming company in the he was paid in salmon He s a man with briny blood The lake at the hamlet of Haukali just off Lysefjord Photography by Kerry Walker I don t believe in cutting corners he says whisking me around the smokery in Skiftun past towering racks of cold and hot smoked salmon There s traceability from roe to table We dry salt our fish with nothing but sea salt and sugar smoking it over beech and juniper You ll find some of the world s best salmon here where the fjords are clean and deep This isn t just sales patter I don t think I ve ever tried such incredible salmon silky treacly gravlax marinated in spices and aquavit meaty flakes of salmon cold smoked over juniper and hot smoked salmon rubbed in pepper and paprika Each year the smokery scoops gold in the Norwegian championships says Mikal with the look of a man who knows all about winning On the road north things take a scenic turn with snow frosted mountains above the spruce forest and fast flowing Suldalslågen one of Norway s most celebrated salmon rivers At Mo Laksegard farmstay in Sand you can fish for some real beauties during the summer Apple picking at Apal Sideri Photography by Feien og Fjong The salmon are renowned for their quality and size says Gjermund Daniel Moe the son of the founder of the business Each year anglers hook Atlantic salmon weighing up to The big rush is from mid July to August I m not here to catch a fish however but to feel what it s like to be one I pop on a dry suit neoprene mask and snorkel to drift downstream on a salmon safari I race down the river at what feels like a million miles an hour over granite pebbles and past eddies It s too early for salmon yet but this little taster of their journey through Norway s glacially cold rivers to the sea and beyond to Greenland certainly gives me a new appreciation of what I ve been eating How to do it Norwegian SAS Widerøe and Logan Air all fly non stop from the UK
