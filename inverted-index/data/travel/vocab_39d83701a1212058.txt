Hotels Stay Things To Do Do Where To Eat Eat Need To Know Know The Fodor s Five The five things you need to know before traveling to Miami and Miami Beach Parking might bankrupt you Whether a surface lot or parking garage at the beach or your hotel s valet parking in Miami is almost always of the break the budget variety If you mainly plan to spend your time between the beach and downtown neighborhoods consider saving money by skipping a car rental and opting to take Uber or Lyft around instead you ll also skip having to navigate for yourself the congestion and free wheeling driving along the city s beach roads and highways You don t need to speak Spanish but bust it out if you do Miami beats to a Latin drum full stop More than of the population identifies as Hispanic or Latino and you ll hear Spanish spoken sung and on speaker phone absolutely everywhere you go here It s what makes Miami Miami and what makes Miami great If you have a working knowledge of the language don t be shy to deploy it you ll feel that much closer to the spirit of the city You can road trip to the Keys but they re hardly next door Don t land in Miami thinking you re going to be sitting at a tiki bar with something frosty in hand in the Florida Keys in a flash Key West is roughly miles southeast of the Miami International Airport a route that regularly takes more than hours to drive If you want a taste of the Keys and have limited time Key Largo the first major island in the chain is about miles hours away There s more than one National Park in these parts Everglades National Park tends to steal the South Florida spotlight and makes for a fun little day trip from Miami But when you re craving some nature and time on the water sans alligators beyond South Beach and beautiful Key Biscayne don t sleep on Biscayne National Park just south of the city With great scuba diving after all you re technically in the northern Florida Keys here largely uninhabited islands and mangrove forests to explore during eco tours the park is within sight of downtown s skyscrapers which makes it all the more fascinating for an escape Downtown s neighborhoods have a far more local vibe than the beach Many a Miamian will tell you they almost never make it out to South Beach and absolutely not a chance if it s over Spring Break or any other peak and packed period So much of the city s creative and culinary buzz of late surrounds downtown Miami neighborhoods like Little River Brickell Allapattah and Wynwood Hit Coconut Grove and Coral Gables just south of downtown for more great stops off the sand too Read More Guidebooks for Every Journey Fodor s South Florida with Miami Fort Lauderdale and the Keys Easy Planning Local Writers Itineraries Pullout Map Buy Now See All
