Stafford Aug min read Share From dining out to booking tickets here s what you need to know before going to Seville Shutterstock Seville is the gleaming jewel in AndalucÃ a â s cultural crown and a superb introduction to the region Packed into Sevilleâ s fairly compact Casco Antiguo Old Town are some of Spainâ s great architectural treasures including the Real AlcÃ zar its most impassioned art form flamenco and a whole host of museums mansions and ornate churches Advertisement The Romans Moors and Reyes Catholic Monarchs of the Spanish Empire came saw conquered and then left the best of themselves behind for all to see And because a great trip is a well planned trip here are all the things you should know about health safety and etiquette in Seville before you go Plan to spend at least three days in Seville Seville demands a proper exploration Barrio Santa Cruz is a great place to start for first time visitors with three UNESCO World Heritage Sites â Real AlcÃ zar Catedral de Seville and Archivo General de Indias â clustered at the edge of the labyrinthine neighborhood These sights could easily consume a couple of days on their own particularly with the riches of the Hospital de los Venerables Sacerdotes and flamenco tablaos such as Casa de la Guitarra also packed into this tiny neighborhood But thereâ s so much more to experience within easy walking distance including scores of fascinating museums churches and mansions And thatâ s without even mentioning the food yet Three days is the minimum youâ ll want to spend here Key attractions such as Real AlcÃ zar have timed entry tickets â get the time wrong and you could be turned away Getty Images Avoid visiting the cathedral and Real AlcÃ zar on the same day Although itâ s tempting to pack all three of Sevilleâ s UNESCO World Heritage sites into one long day itâ s not advisable if you want to experience them properly Both the Catedral de Sevilla and Real AlcÃ zar are accessible via a specific entry time ticket only turn up early or late and you might be turned away Itâ ll be less fun visiting the first site if you know you have to hurry through it to make it in time to enter the second site They are also both vast places that demand a lot of walking and standing The Real AlcÃ zar and its gardens need at least half a day to explore thoroughly The cathedral is one of the worldâ s largest and its Giralda is accessed via an approximately meter climb which is extra draining if youâ re visiting during hot weather The Archivo General de Indias however makes for a perfect second sight to see on day one before tackling either the cathedral or Real AlcÃ zar fresh the next day If youâ re on a budget try to grab the free tickets to major sights Each week Catedral de Sevilla offers free tickets The tickets allow access to the cathedral and Giralda tower with up for grabs each day from Monday to Friday valid for entry only These tickets can only be secured on the official cathedral website Unsurprisingly demand is monumental and they often get snapped up very quickly so you might need to try a couple of times Advertisement Similarly the Real AlcÃ zar has free entrance for an hour on Mondays Reserve these free tickets on the official website for entry from between April and September and from between October and March If you visit in the hotter summer months carry water and drink often to stay hydrated in the dry heat Getty Images You donâ t need to avoid high summer you just need to prepare well One of the great things about Seville is that thereâ s never really a bad time to visit While some blogs will advise to avoid July and August the reality isnâ t all that bad In fact the old city was designed and laid out to keep most streets in the shade throughout the day Most hotels have air conditioned rooms and the advantage of visiting when most people are scared away is that you will bag some bargain prices for hotel rooms right in the Casco Viejo If youâ re happy to work an afternoon siesta into your itinerary â when many places are closed anyway â you can still make the most of the mornings and evenings to explore But donâ t forget to bring sunglasses a hat and sunscreen and drink plenty of water throughout the day Two major spring festivals draw crowds to Seville The spring shoulder season is becoming an increasingly popular time to visit Seville Average temperatures climb above C F the sights arenâ t overcrowded and the orange blossoms perfume the whole city But itâ s worth noting that this season also welcomes Sevilleâ s two biggest festivals The first is Semana Santa Easter Holy Week which draws huge crowds to the streets to witness the various protests and events Two weeks later Andalucian customs and cuisine are celebrated with a good measure of drinking for the Feria de Abril The dates for both change every year You might well want to experience these joyous events for yourself in which case book as far ahead as possible Otherwise aim to visit either side of these parties to dodge the crowds Driving in central Seville is challenging If youâ re planning to rent a car and drive around AndalucÃ a itâ s worth considering ditching the car for the Seville portion of your trip Similar to other historic cities in the region such as the narrow streets one way system pedestrianized zones and complete lack of parking all make driving a hassle Besides Seville is one of the best cities in Spain to explore on foot Most kitchens have fixed opening hours so you re unlikely to find anywhere serving an evening meal before Emad Aljumah Getty Images Donâ t expect to find any dinner before Mealtimes in Seville are short sharp bursts of frenetic culinary activity that demand a rest period in between As with most of Spain restaurants in Seville are not set up to sate the hunger whenever it rises Instead kitchens open at very rigid and specific times with little exception In most cases doors will be closed until By the place will be packed out as the locals come out to eat a light dinner of tapas Lunch is the dayâ s main meal for most Andalucians and takes place during a similarly rigid window of If youâ re accustomed to eating lunch or dinner at different times buy some snacks at a supermarket such as Carrefour Express to keep you going An introductory cheek kiss is mostly the norm When youâ re introduced to a local it can be rather surprising to see them coming in for a light peck on either cheek particularly if you come from a place where personal space is a thing If itâ s between two men a firm handshake is expected but any other gender combination applies the two kiss rule Sevilleâ s LGBTIQ community is welcomed and celebrated Like the rest of urban Spain Seville is a culturally open minded and liberal city where the LGBTIQ community is embraced The city hosts the regionâ s biggest Pride parade â Orgullo de AndalucÃ a in late June â and there are gay friendly businesses throughout the city The communityâ s hub is around Alameda de HÃ rcules which is unsurprisingly Sevilleâ s best nightlife area Tipping is appreciated but not expected As with most of Europe tipping in Spain isnâ t mandatory As a customer youâ re not expected to supplement somebodyâ s wages here But giving a little extra at restaurants and tapas bars â is adequate â is always appreciated and often well deserved Youâ ll soon discover that service in Spain during peak mealtimes is an art form that combines patience endurance and the unique ability to balance a great amount of crockery while weaving through impossibly tight gaps in the crowd Drink more water than you think you need Part of Sevilleâ s allure to visitors is the hot and dry climate meaning youâ re less likely to travel all that way for rain to dampen the plans But the caveat is that the heat is a dry heat You might not realize how much youâ re sweating as it evaporates so quickly Naturally this means dehydration and heat stroke can creep up on you Always carry at least a liter of water with you and drink little but often throughout the day Seville is generally safe butâ While it always pays to be cautious and stay in control go easy on the sangria Seville is considered to be one of the safest cities in Spain From the tap water which is completely fine to drink to the low levels of pickpocketing and street crime even at night itâ s acceptable to bring down your barriers in Seville Of course as with all human habitations crime does exist however rare it may be Maintain vigilance of your belongings particularly in the train and bus stations and during busy or crowded times such as at festivals Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Spain Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get
