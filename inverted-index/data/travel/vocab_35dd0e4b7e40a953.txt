Apr PM KarenWoo Join Date Mar Posts Likes Received Likes on Posts Oh that s too bad about the closing of the second suspension bridge Obviously it s necessary But what a disappointment The Hooker Valley Track was one of the highlights of our trip to NZ last November Can you hike up to the first bridge There are other hikes such as the Kea Point hike which we didn t have time to do but I understand are beautiful as well and give you great views We enjoyed our stay at Aoraki Court Motel in Mt Cook Village Highly recommend Even though Christchurch is lovely I wouldn t spend nights there Stay there your first night and allocate the other nights somewhere else such as Aoraki Fox Franz Josef Queenstown or Dunedin I haven t been to Dunedin but the extra night in all of these places give you a buffer in case of bad weather I would definitely stay in Te Anau nights We originally scheduled nights and our Milford Sound Tour was cancelled due to rain We added an extra night which necessitated eliminating a night from Wanaka so that we could do the Milford Sound Cruise a highlight of our trip OR you could spend your last night in Christchurch I know the drive from Hokitika to Christchurch is supposedly hours but the Arthus Pass drive is beautiful and I am sure you will want to stop many times for photos I am sure that others who have more experience than I have will

elsewhere especially since you have so many short stays Keep in mind that one night isn t even a full day so this is more of a driving itinerary than an in depth exploring itinerary Reply View Public
