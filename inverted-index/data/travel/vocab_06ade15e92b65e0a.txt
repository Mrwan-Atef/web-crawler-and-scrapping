Searching for traces of the ancient Chola dynasty TRAVEL Searching for traces of the ancient Chola dynasty One of the world s most remarkable and little known empires comes to life in south India with new heritage tours Built in the century Gangaikondacholisvaram Temple in Tamil Nadu India is one of the few remaining structures built by the once mighty Chola dynasty Photograph by K L RAJA PONSING Alamy Stock Photos By Meenakshi J January min read The only thing left of the grand city of Gangaikondacholapuram in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu is a temple amidst paddy fields But for a time it was an epicenter of medieval Southeast Asia and the capital of one of the oldest and longest ruling dynasties in the world For nearly years the Chola dynasty B C A D asserted its power influencing religion culture and architecture via a sophisticated maritime trade system that extended from India throughout Southeast Asia and even to China Yet despite the kingdom s extensive trade route system and widespread power the Cholas remained shrouded in mystery for centuries while later invaders like the Mughals and British gained prominence in India s larger academic and cultural history Now technology backed excavations custom Chola heritage tours and a record breaking Indian film have rekindled interest in the Cholas creating opportunities for travelers to help solve one of history s greatest mysteries What happened to the empire The golden age The Cholas were one of the three most powerful Tamil kingdoms in medieval southern India At the empire s zenith Chola kings

the details that could provide clues about the city layout and the lives led by its inhabitants remain elusive Any shred of physical evidence found is exciting Historians are still unraveling why the city and its people disappeared in the century but many believe that an invasion led by a rival kingdom in the latter half of the century may have played a part Jatavarman Sundara Pandya of the Pandya dynasty had invaded places nearby Gangaikondacholapuram He must have razed the city to the ground sparing just the temple says Chitra Madhavan an author and a historian She adds that Hindu kings often
