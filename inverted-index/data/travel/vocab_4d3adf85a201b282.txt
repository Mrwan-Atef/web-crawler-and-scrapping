traveling to Philadelphia Philly is made up of a tapestry of neighborhoods and cultures While you may visit with a list of must sees don t forget to leave plenty of time for open exploration Each Philadelphia neighborhood has its own distinct culture that makes it unique You ll have a completely different experience eating comfort food in West Philly than you will visiting the museums of Old
