visiting South Korea From the best time to visit to local etiquette you should be aware of here s what travellers should know when planning a trip By Martin Zatko November This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK South Korea is an easy country to visit its transport system is first class and basic English is generally understood However it still pays to do some research prior to a visit to the country which has its own etiquette and a set of public holidays that follows the Lunar calendar and Buddhist tradition Here s what you should know Do I need a visa to visit South Korea Citizens of most countries including the US Canada the UK Australia and most European Union members can travel to South Korea visa free for between one and six months the majority are allowed days However you may have to show a Korea Electronic Travel Authorization K ETA approval to board your flight Requirements vary by nationality and the situation has been in flux since the Covid pandemic check the relevant government s website for the latest information If you do need to get one K ETAs can be applied for online and cost under While the approval usually comes through almost immediately it can take up to three days How long should I spend in the country on a first time visit Although booking through a tour operator will provide convenience and peace of mind Korea is a simple country to travel around independently too Seven nights would just about give you enough time to chalk off the main draws of Seoul Gyeongju Busan and Jeju island By adding another week you ll be able to travel at a more relaxed pace and add national parks such as Seoraksan in the northeast islands like those around Mokpo and lesser visited cities to your itinerary Are there likely to be any major language barriers Most locals speak at least a little English and many especially younger folk are fluent in the language Koreans use their own alphabet known as hangeul but almost all major street and subway signs have English language translations as do plenty of restaurant and cafe menus Announcements in buses and trains are almost always followed by translations in English too That said any attempt to speak the basics is appreciated What local etiquette should I be aware of The country has a very different social system to the West and while locals are generally very forgiving of foreign visitors it s polite to observe a few pointers especially while eating or drinking Chopsticks should be rested horizontally rather than sticking out of the bowl and not used for pointing noses should not be blown at the table if you re with others and when drinking alcohol it s customary to clink glasses before almost every sip geonbae is Korean for cheers then turn slightly away from the person you re with while you do the actual drinking Some restaurants and guesthouses require you to take off your footwear before entering this should be fairly obvious if you see a pile of shoes outside a door but visitors might miss the sign What about cultural differences Korea has a major Confucian legacy a system of thought that encourages ancestor worship and values filial piety Simply being older commands some respect in the country which is one reason you might be asked your age even by someone you ve only just met How do I get there Seoul s Incheon Airport is South Korea s only international airport with direct services to US and European hubs The country s two major airlines are Asiana and Korean Air However it s typically cheaper to fly indirectly via a Middle Eastern Chinese or Southeast Asian hub with local carriers The country s public transport system is excellent Limousine buses head to destinations around the country directly from the airport or you can connect to the national rail network by taking a train from the airport to Seoul Station Prepaid T money cards available at the airport or any subway station can be used on city transport countrywide When should I visit Korea s spring and autumn seasons April to early June and September to early November are particularly good times to visit Temperatures are mild with typical daily highs of and rainfall is low Most visitors come at these times since the summer months can be stifling often hitting and humid with heavy rains Winters are generally dry though the mercury can plummet to and lower Are there any public holidays I should be aware of South Korea has three key celebrations Seollal the Lunar New Year falls in January or February Chuseok also known as Hangawi is a mid autumn harvest festival and day long Dano also called Surit nal is an early summer celebration believed to carry positive yang energy The first two involve multi day celebrations with locals returning to their hometowns to pay respect to their elders During these times traffic between Seoul and the provinces can be heavy and many businesses close However cultural sites tend to hold events and visitors can spot traditional hanbok attire try festive food and join in with folk games Try tteokguk soup with rice cakes on Seollal or head to Gangneung Danoje a Dano festival that includes a masked stage play
