Shivaratri itâ s one of the most memorable cultural events on the calendar Key Events Maha Shivaratri Advertisement March Everything seems to be easing in March from the risk of cyclones and the high

windsurfing than for diving and snorkeling Kitesurfers should make their way to the renowned Rodrigues International Kitesurfing Festival which has been running since Key Events Rodrigues
