Morocco is home to some of the worldâ s most striking mountain landscapes Ramble through fragrant forests of cedar trees and walk along verdant valleys where time has stood still More adventurous hikers scale North Africaâ s tallest peak or head off on demanding multi day treks across rugged massifs With peaks and valleys to suit all abilities atmospheric eco friendly lodgings and a tasty tagine waiting for you at the journeyâ s end here are our top picks for hiking in Morocco Replenish at one of the village shops on the way to the summit of Jebel Toubkal Â Shutterstock Ondrej Bucek Jebel Toubka Best high altitude hike miles days hard Advertisement The High Atlas â Moroccoâ s loftiest mountain range known to the locals as Idraren Draren or Mountains of Mountains â runs diagonally across the country for almost miles and is a trekkerâ s paradise especially in spring and autumn The biggest draw is the ascent of Jebel Toubkal North Africaâ s highest peak at Much of the trekking is done on the first day a six hour hike zigzagging upwards through a craggy valley Stop to acclimatize and share campfire tales with fellow climbers at a rustic refuge before setting off at first light to scale the snow dusted summit Youâ ll need snow equipment in the winter months but if youâ re blessed with brilliant blue skies youâ ll have views all the way to the Sahara With more time you can take on the challenging week long Toubkal Circuit and as well as tackling Toubkal youâ ll meander between remote Amazigh Berber villages crossing fertile valleys rocky massifs and panoramic passes The mountain village of Imlil minutes from Marrakesh is a hub for hikers and the place to hire a mountain guide compulsory in Toubkal National Park and book a bed at one of the refuges There are plenty of other treks to try stay in style at the sustainable Kasbah du Toubkal and you can hike to their remote lodge in the Azzaden Valley Spot the one of a kind Barbary macaques in the cedar forest of Morocco on this hike Â Ekaterina Pokrovsky Shutterstock The Monkey Trail Squared Loop Trail Best for wildlife watching miles hours moderate Close to Ifrane â aka Moroccoâ s Little Switzerland thanks to its Alpine architecture and spotless streets â Ifrane National Park is spread over sq km sq miles of the Middle Atlas mountains Itâ s famed for its fragrant forests of Atlas cedars and troops of endangered Barbary macaques The one of a kind primate was once widespread in Europe and North Africa but is now only found in small pockets of Morocco and Algeriaâ s northern mountain ranges The park has several well marked easy to moderate trails but â as the name suggests â the Monkey Trail will give you a good chance of spotting the mischievous macaques as well as other forest residents such as foxes and wild boar Itâ s great for trail runners and mountain bikers too since itâ s shaded by lofty oak and cedar trees Enlist a guide such as Saleh Boudaoud to discover more about the parkâ s flora and fauna and the threats the macaques face from human interaction and poaching for the exotic pet trade Take a dip in a natural pool at the Akchour Waterfall â minutes from Chefchaouen Â Shutterstock Stefano Zaccaria Akchour Waterfall and Godâ s Bridge Best for waterfall lovers miles hours moderate Advertisement Tucked into the green folds of the Rif Mountains charming Chefchaouen is famed for its endlessly photogenic blue hued medina But once youâ ve explored its cobbled streets and people watched from its pretty squares take to the trails of the vast Talassemtane National Park with its luminous waterfalls and forests of firs This popular hike starts in the village of Akchour around minutes from Chefchaouen by grand taxi Head towards the hydroelectric dam and a fork in the road where the well trodden left hand trail dips through evergreen forest and between moss covered rock formations After around minutes youâ ll reach the first waterfall but keep going until you reach the larger cascade that plunges into an emerald green pool â perfect for a refreshing dip before you make your way back to the dam Once there you can extend the hike by taking the right hand trail and the steep scramble to Godâ s Bridge a natural arch straddling two cliffs Then stop at one of the roadside stalls near the Akchour end of the trail for a well earned tagine or immerse yourself in the park with a stay in a stunning wood and stone cabin at the eco friendly Ermitage dâ Akchour Jebel Saghro Circuit Best for off the beaten track trekking miles days moderate Sandwiched between the High Atlas and the Saharaâ s shifting sands in southeast Morocco the Saghro Massif possesses a stark beauty with yawning canyons flat topped mesas otherworldly rock formations and arid desert scapes Its stony tracks are frequented more by the semi nomadic AÃ t Atta tribe than tourists And while there are steep ascents and descents trails are generally lower lying and less challenging than the High Atlas Its highest peak Amalou nâ ou Mansour sits at and most passes are between and The Saghro Circuit takes five days starting at Tagdilt near Boumalne DadÃ s and ending at Kalaat Mâ Gouna Add an extra day to reach the peak of Jebel Kouaouch with views to rival those from Toubkal If youâ re going without a guide youâ ll need to be confident at navigating and stock up on supplies before you set off And there are plenty of shorter out and back trails and one way walks To the south the Kasbah HÃ tel AÃ t Omar in the kasbah studded oasis town of Nkob makes a great base with its vegetarian friendly restaurant and insider tips for routes and local guides You can ramble to â and around â the ancient Roman city of Volubilis near Fez Â Doug McKinlay Lonely Planet Moulay Idriss to Volubilis Best for culture vultures miles minutes one way easy Just minutes from Fez and minutes from Meknes the holy hilltop town of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun is the perfect starting point for a leisurely ramble to the archaeological site of Volubilis a far flung outpost of the Roman Empire turned Unesco World Heritage Site Walk downhill from the bus station to a roundabout where signs point you in the direction of a slower pace of life as you wind your way through pine forests olive groves and across a fertile plain towards triumphal arches ancient columns and glittering mosaics Head back to the whitewashed town on foot by taxi or donkey and refuel with a traditional three course feast on the terrace of Dar Zerhoune while you drink in the views Todra Gorge Best for day hikes miles hours easy The Loop Hike trail at Todra Gorge is one of the most popular day trips on the eastern side of the Atlas Mountains Intrepid travelers with experience on this trail say itâ s safe for unguided hiking with inspiring degree views of the gorgeâ s high walls along the path The gorge is the starting point for several hiking trail options but the Loop Hike keeps things scenic and easy Panoramic views on this trail also afford stellar views of surrounding mountainscapes without a strenuous climb Intrepid travelers recommend this adventure as a worthwhile day stop while commuting between Marrakesh and the Sahara Desert The self guided loop trail starts at the northern end of the gorges to Tizgui a Berber village at the southern entrance In addition to otherworldly activities on foot rock climbing is also a major draw for mountaineers Standout stays nearby include Hotel Xaluca DadÃ s a room accommodation north of the city center and Auberge Le Festival a tranquil room eco hotel Due to its remote nature both hotels are great places to dine and Auberge Le Festival is said to regularly entertain with live music Restaurant La Petite Gorge is one the best spots for traditional Moroccan eats and the natural beauty surrounding Kasbah Petit Nomade while eating tagine or couscous adds to the majestic feel of your visit M Goun Circuit Best for extended multi day hikes miles days hard This lesser visited hiking path is arduous but the epic trek takes hikers through the Ait Bougamez and M Goun valleys The rewards of choosing this circuit include lush valley views snow dusted mountains and what many consider one of the best places to visit in Morocco for hiking Plus its high point â Jebel Mâ Goun â is the second highest peak in North Africa Hiring a local guide is highly recommended for this trail since the journey is virtually unmarked and itâ s more tricky after a snowfall Navigating the terrain can be challenging at times and guides can assist with following local customs or facilitating support during an emergency Local Berber guides also typically provide a cook tents mules and other supplies for the multi day trek The primary accommodation options are trekking refuges and homestays For a high end stay and the areaâ s best formal dining setting consider a modest mix of old and new worlds at La Kasbah du M Goun Tips for hiking in Morocco Finding others to hike with Hiking in Morocco is a bucket list item for many so finding hiking partners is fairly simple Before you depart check out travel groups on social media Theyâ re a great place to connect with other

a last minute trek As for finding local guides to lead your hike that depends on your trail of choice as each trail has its own operating procedures Many trails are fairly challenging so it s important to confirm if your hike requires local guidance Before hiring a guide itâ s essential to ask questions to get a feel for the guide and manage each otherâ s expectations Is it safe to hike solo in Morocco In many cases hiking solo in Morocco is generally safe when following a few precautions A Moroccan contact should know where you are at all times and when youâ ll be back Reserve solo
