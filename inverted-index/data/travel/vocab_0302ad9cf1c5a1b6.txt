ji is a World Heritage listed sprawling temple complex located in the Daigo district of Kyoto which lies on the east side of the Higashiyama mountains accessible by the Tōzai subway line Outside of the cherry blossom season early April it s not a high priority destination but it makes a good half day trip for those who like hiking and want a break from the more famous temples in the city centre Daigo ji was founded in by Shobo who gave it the name Daigo meaning the ultimate essence of milk This refers to the five periods of Buddha s teaching which were compared to the five forms of milk prepared in India the highest form is called daigo in Japanese The temple was expanded into a vast complex on two levels Shimo Daigo lower and Kami Daigo upper Kami Daigo is atop Daigo yama behind the temple During the century those buildings on the lower level were destroyed with the sole exception of the five storey pagoda Garan Built in this pagoda is treasured as the oldest of its kind in Japan and is the oldest existing building in Kyoto In the late century Hideyoshi took a fancy to Daigo ji and ordered extensive rebuilding It is now one of the Shingon school s main temples To explore Daigo ji thoroughly and at a leisurely pace mixing some hiking with your temple viewing you will need at least half a day The subtemple Sampō in is a fine example of the amazing opulence of that period The Kanō paintings and the garden are special features From Sampō in it s a steep and tiring one hour climb up to Kami Daigo To get here walk up the large avenue of cherry trees through the Niō mon gate out the back gate of the lower temple up a concrete incline and into the forest past the pagoda To get to Daigo ji take the Tōzai line subway east from central Kyoto to the Daigo stop and walk east towards the mountains for about minutes there are signs pointing the way Make sure that the train you board is bound for Rokujizō as some head to Hama Ōtsu instead Read more Contact Address Higashiōji
