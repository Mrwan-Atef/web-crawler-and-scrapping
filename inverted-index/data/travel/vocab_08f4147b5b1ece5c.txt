A guide to Quebec City Canada s historic provincial capital View of Fairmont Le Château Frontenac the Port of Quebec and St Lawrence River Photograph by Jeff Frenette TRAVEL A guide to Quebec City Canada s historic provincial capital Canada s historic crown jewel serves up high drama with century squares turreted hotels and electric neighbourhoods all encircled by epic wilderness By Alicia Miller Photographs by Jeff Frenette January min read This article was adapted from National Geographic Traveller UK Chocolate box buildings with brimming flower boxes An imposing fortress encircled by cannons Soaring city walls cobbled squares horse and carriage rides Where in the world are you You d probably guess France maybe Switzerland or Germany But this is in fact North America Quebec City one of the continent s oldest colonial settlements Some years after its founding it delivers century atmosphere so rich it can feel like stepping onto a film set Wander the picturesque old town divided into Upper and Lower halves connected by steep stairways and an old funicular and your fingers will twitch for a camera The Lower Quartier Petit Champlain has artisan shops and muralled squares The Upper marked by a sweeping boardwalk and the landmark Fairmont Le Château Frontenac hotel sparkles with Victorian glamour in fact you half expect a bonneted lady to stroll past However there s more to Quebec City than its looks Nearly half a millennium of history means that when you scratch beneath the surface the stories get interesting Think churches stuffed with paintings rescued during the French Revolution monasteries that hosted Canada s first hospital and ballrooms where Roosevelt and Churchill planned D Day Then of course there s the culture In so many ways Quebec City is a slice of bygone France And not just in the mansard roofs and Gallic signage but in the white tableclothed restaurants unironically dishing up retro duck à l orange and crêpes suzette But for every full French moment there s a counterpoint You need only step into an American style diner for poutine cheese curds chips and gravy or nibble fresh maple taffy to know Paris is more than miles away Part of the city s charm is what it offers beyond its old city walls Here you ll find trendy neighbourhoods punctuated with hip wine bars and breweries offering a sense of how real life ticks along inside the tourist magnet Then beyond that there s wilderness A minute drive will take you not just out of the city but standing by a crashing waterfall kayaking along a river and cycling past fields full of ripening blackcurrants And perhaps that s where the European comparisons draw thin Beautiful diverse landscapes minutes from a cosmopolitan hub That s unmistakably Canadian People walking
