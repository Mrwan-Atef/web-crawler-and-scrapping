How to save a lighthouse Sleep in one TRAVEL NEWS How to save a lighthouse Sleep in one Once beacons in rough waters these historic structures now face an uncertain future Dusk falls on Heceta Head Lighthouse Bed Breakfast in Oregon Many lighthouse owners are turning to hospitality industry to keep the lights on Photograph by Edwin Remsburg VW Pics Getty Images By Anna Fiorentino April min read At moonrise Lorraine Coyle likes to climb the five flights of stairs to the gallery deck of the lantern room at Borden Flats Lighthome located feet off the coast of Massachusetts The flag is flapping in the wind seagulls fly by at eye level and there s nothing like the sound of a foghorn says Coyle a New Yorker and frequent guest at this offshore lighthouse at the mouth of the Taunton River Built in Borden Flats once guided steamships into the bustling textile mill port of Fall River Now as one of about lighthouse inns in the United States it s a beacon for travelers looking for a unique secluded stay in a historical setting Once we found out that it was possible to actually stay at a lighthouse there was no stopping us says Coyle who has stayed at four She s not alone in her enthusiasm The popularity of these accommodations especially in a time of COVID social distancing means that places like Borden Flats may already be fully booked for the season Many of these inns are a labor of love on the part of either aficionados who may have acquired a lighthouse via auction or of private and public groups that may have even gotten one for free It s one of the ways people are working to save lighthouses which suffer from neglect erosion and intense weather due to climate change and their own obsolescence as mariners turn to other navigational aids There s a lot of beauty in the sunsets and sunrises and the extreme locations of these lighthouses says Nick Korstad who has bought five to renovate including Borden Flats But for me the romance is in ensuring that the history of keepers who sacrificed their lives isn t forgotten The person who loves that lighthouse is its soul That s what shines through the light Awarded for his preservation efforts Korstad is in his own way among the last of the lighthouse keepers Nick Korstad sails past Borden Flats Lighthome one of several lighthouses he has purchased and renovated Photographs by Barry Chin The Boston Globe

ultimate gesture of welcome for visitors and mariners a sign of good business and trade Lightkeepers were romanticized for their rugged independence and often took on heroic roles America s women lighthouse keepers are finally being seen The ancient world s most famous lighthouse was built in the third century B C in Alexandria Egypt In the century Scottish civil engineer Robert Stevenson the grandfather of novelist Robert Louis Stevenson set the standard for lighthouse construction including inventing intermittent and flashing lights He built Bell Rock Lighthouse in now the world s oldest working offshore lighthouse Over the next two centuries he and his family constructed more than lighthouses many still standing today Of his family s legendary engineering innovations Robert Louis Stevenson once wrote I might well write books till and not serve humanity so well With the adoption of the Fresnel lens to magnify light beams for miles thousands of lighthouses went up in the to warn boats of danger and guide them to safe harbor Outlasting the rising tides A hundred years ago the U S had about a thousand working lighthouses Now about remain See map above to locate them Lighthouses dropped off as a federal priority once lights became automated via solar power in the mid century With the advent of GPS many sat decaying We ll lose a number of lighthouses in the coming decades especially the ones that are offshore and inaccessible to tourists says lighthouse historian Jeremy D Entremont Their importance will continue to fade because of GPS and other electronics Used now by boaters only as a visual reference these magnificent towers are endangered Many still have the original timber eaves and gutter systems If you replace them with thick vinyl siding or PVC it will just stick out like a sore thumb says Korstad who spends a year to maintain his seven bedroom Big Bay Point Lighthouse Bed Breakfast the country s first lighthouse inn Propped up on a four mile sandstone peninsula Big Bay Point reigns over an emerald green section of Lake Superior and is one of lighthouses down from left in Michigan the state with the most of these beacons The Great Lakes North America s greatest resource is at risk The largest regional concentration of lights numbering around can be found along New England s rocky coast including another offshore accommodation Maine s Goose Rocks Lighthouse About lighthouses ones that haven t already been moved submerged or replaced by fixed light poles sit on the Chesapeake Bay where water levels have risen faster than the global average Others dot the Florida panhandle and the craggy west coast like Oregon s boutique Heceta Head Lighthouse Bed Breakfast and New Dungeness Lighthouse where guests sleep in a National Wildlife Refuge on the tip of the longest sand spit in North America The National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of has allowed many lighthouses to be offloaded while still staying active They re transferred from the U S Coast Guard to local and state municipalities or nonprofits for free through the National Park Service If there are no takers they re auctioned off to private individuals Big Sable Point Lighthouse rises above Lake Michigan s eastern shore Michigan has the most lighthouses in the U S Photograph by Alan Majchrowicz DanitaDelimont com After lighthouses are transferred or sold the Coast Guard has the right to continue running all active lights but it s absolved of the responsibility of caring for the often decaying lighthouses themselves At any time the Coast Guard can take back the lights that are transferred at no cost and there s a laundry list of preservation requirements to which the caretaker groups must adhere With limited funds and the cumulative effect of decades of neglect along with changes in the sea and its intensity the battle is going to prove insurmountable for many wave swept lighthouses and for those clinging to coastal perches says Bob Trapani overseer of an organization committed to saving lighthouses the American Lighthouse Foundation Groups have banded together to restore these structures not only operating them as inns but also as museums to offset costs They ve moved them back from the shoreline including North Carolina s Cape Hatteras the country s tallest and Massachusetts Gay Head Light This lesser known cape in Massachusetts exudes maritime history and magical light We have come a long way and every year lighthouse preservation gets more exposure says Jeff Gales who is dedicated to education and aiding restoration for the U S Lighthouse Society But for some beacons help is already too late The foot wave battered Kauhola Point Lighthouse in Hawaii was demolished in to prevent it from toppling off its cliff and causing injury New Jersey s East Point Lighthouse and Oregon s Tillamook Rock barely cling to land Dozens of others sit abandoned and vandalized awaiting costly lead paint removal before transfer or repairs The city of Chicago plans to return Chicago Harbor Lighthouse to the federal government after it sat decaying for years in the wake of a failed plan to transform it into a high end hotel It s great when someone wants to take these lighthouses but a lot of times a nonprofit or a city saw something for free a lighthouse and thought it was a cash cow They do a study and realize it s a drain cow and it just sits there says Korstad While the future is uncertain for these beacons what s as clear as each light s unique flash is that it s worth making one home for a night or two while you still can It connects guests to the past says Korstad and takes them to a place they ve never been The coronavirus pandemic has challenged communities and disrupted travel Be sure to
