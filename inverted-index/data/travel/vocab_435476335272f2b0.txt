Photographer Rebecca Douglas has always been fascinated by the night sky Her love of the stars has taken the U K resident on star walking trips to Iceland and into the Arctic where she steps out onto darkened trails to capture twinkling constellations and glowing planets in her images For nature lovers like Douglas star walking is turning out to be a welcome antidote for pandemic times By visiting hills and valleys after sunset outdoor enthusiasts not only gain all the health benefits of being in nature they find empty trails unfolding under a limitless night sky Hiking at night isn t uncommon Plenty of people hike after dark to get to campsites or watch the sunrise from a mountaintop Star walking goes a step further by blending hiking with stargazing Rather than heading to an observatory or setting up a telescope in your backyard star walking takes you on a brief journey to look at the stars from different viewpoints A couple tackles a rocky trail in Val Senales Glacier park in South Tyriol Italy Photograph by Stephen Lux Alamy Now is the time to try a post sunset stroll March marks the vernal equinox the first day of spring in the Northern Hemisphere when day and night are about equal in length After that nights get shorter into summer Why go on a star walk Whether you re standing on a mountainside with the landscape s silhouette framing the moon or gazing out over a darkened lake with stars reflecting on the water star walking is often much more dynamic than traditional stargazing An observatory is no substitute for getting out into a rural landscape under a blanket of stars says Gary Lintern of Stargazing Nights in Durham England who leads guided nighttime hikes It s a magical experience and I enjoy sharing it especially at some of my favorite locations like the High Force Waterfall England s largest cataract in Teesdale What s more star walking is good for you There are plenty of studies that show the health benefits of being in nature Spending at least two hours a week outdoors particularly while engaging in activities that involve effortless attention can decrease blood pressure heart rate and stress levels Does forest bathing really improve health A skeptic finds out Walking at night has the added benefit of improving sleep which is important for overall health says Christina Pierpaoli Parker a behavioral sleep researcher at the University of Alabama Parker says that star walking works on two physiological processes that determine sleep quality Movement and exercise such as relaxing stargazing walks outside may promote sleep by acting on the homeostatic sleep drive which influences the pressure to doze she says Additionally evening strolls may counteract the disruptive effects of increased screen time on the circadian system the body s way of regulating the sleep cycle Step into the night So how does an aspiring star walker get started It doesn t take much more than a sturdy pair of boots While telescopes and binoculars obviously have their uses I always encourage people to start with naked eye stargazing says Lintern When we focus in on something small like binoculars it s a completely different state of mind compared to just opening up and allowing ourselves to get lost in the infinite expanse of space and letting our minds drift Related Spectacular night sky views from around the world of A lone photographer stands in
