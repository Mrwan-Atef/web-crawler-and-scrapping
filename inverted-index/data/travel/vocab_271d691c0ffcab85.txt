coastline with lovely views of the beach It usually takes three to five days to complete the full walk otherwise take on just a section as a day or afternoon hike using water taxis to return to your starting point Alternatively go kayaking to the national parkâ s seal colony dive into the waters or simply relax in tiny hidden coves and bays Planning tip Cars are only able to drive as far as TÅ
