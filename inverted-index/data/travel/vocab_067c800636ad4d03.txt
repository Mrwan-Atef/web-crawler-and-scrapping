Cape Town Lucy Corne May min read Share We ve got a few trips before you get stuck into Cape Town Â Lauren Mulligan Lonely Planet When I moved to Cape Town more than a decade ago the plan had been to stick around for a year We quickly realized that months wouldnâ t be enough There is something about this city that just enchants people A lot of it has to do with the landscape of course â Table Mountain provides a centerpiece thatâ s surrounded by forest lake and eventually golden beach â but its diverse terrain also provides the perfect stage for all manner of outdoor adventures This includes hiking climbing abseiling surfing paragliding and mountain biking Advertisement But itâ s not just sporty types that are well catered for in Cape Town This city has an exciting art scene plus shopping for all tastes and budgets It has marvelous opportunities for those whose passions lie in drinking and dining The city has its problems of course â a wide poverty gap and a rising crime rate among them â but the good vastly outweighs any negatives Cape Townâ s laidback pace of life coupled with its expansive menu of attractions keep people exploring here for far longer than they might have originally planned And I should know â Iâ ve been here for years and still feel as if I havenâ t seen half of what the city has to offer There is so much to see in Cape Town that even the residents can t see it all Â Getty Images However long you plan to stay it will never be enough Most people schedule four or five days in Cape Town Itâ s enough time to get to the top of Table Mountain visit the penguins and maybe take a surf class or a Cape Malay cooking course You should be able to shop a little eat a lot drink some wine and marvel at the majesty of Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden too A week of course would be better But a month still wouldnâ t be long enough Most people donâ t have weeks to spare though With four or five days in the city â ideally a week â you can see all the major sights Cape Townâ s notoriously fickle weather permitting pick the perfect restaurant book a few weeks ahead for big name fine dining joints and get a feel for the cityâ s general joie de vivre You can always tackle the rest on your next visit because once youâ ve become acquainted with the city youâ re guaranteed to want to come back Grab an Uber into the city from the airport Buses no longer service Cape Town International Airport leaving fewer options for getting into the city center If youâ re planning to rent a car for your stay youâ re sorted Most major car hire companies have desks at the airport Advertisement If not approved taxi companies have desks inside the arrivals hall Else follow the lead of the locals and order an Uber once you re past baggage reclaim Not only is it the cheapest option but it s also considered a safe way to travel Try and avoid the touts outside the airport offering to arrange taxis or Ubers Some might be legit but itâ s best to exercise caution The Cape Town weather suits everyone from sunbathers to penguins Â Matthew Micah Wright Getty Images Pack a change of clothes whenever you leave the house Cape Town residents are very fond of saying that the city experiences four seasons in one day and while visitors from the northern hemisphere might scoff at a Capetonianâ s idea of winter itâ s true that the weather is capricious In spring and autumn you could start the day with a jersey and long pants need sunscreen and hats by lunchtime and be shopping for umbrellas by mid afternoon Winter is largely wet but there are days when youâ ll need sunblock Meanwhile summer afternoons can get pretty windy and have you reaching for a jacket To be on the safe side pack sunscreen sunglasses and something with sleeves into your day bag Ask if there are any areas to avoid Most Cape Town visits are incident free but itâ s a good idea to get the lowdown on which areas to avoid from your host The city center is generally fine but after dark itâ s best not to wander alone Sunday afternoons and Monday evenings tend to be pretty quiet too Keep your wits about you if there arenâ t many people around Locals will likely tell you to avoid the Cape Flats Yet you can visit many of its restaurants and attractions during the day without any trouble The Flats also has some good nightlife too Stay in one of its guesthouses or homestays if you want a bit more immersion To explore these neighborhoods in any depth itâ s best to do so with a local guide It may be close to the city but remember that Table Mountain can be cold and windy Â Artie Photography Artie Ng Getty Images Reminder Table Mountain is still a mountain Visible from pretty much every corner of the city Cape Townâ s flat topped mountain is the emblem and the pride of the South African capital It s also a must see Donâ t let its proximity to the center fool you Even on a sunny day the weather at the top is often cool and windy so donâ t head up in your beach gear with no layers to add If youâ re hiking rather than taking the cable car adopt the usual rules donâ t go alone always tell people where youâ re headed stick to marked trails pre plan your route Every year there are tales of travelers who get lost on the mountain and have to rely on local search and rescue services to bring them back down Take local advice on which route to tackle Some are safe while others should only be attempted with larger groups or in the company of a seasoned guide Conceal your food around baboons Baboons are a part of life in the Cape Peninsula Most visitors will give these large toothed primates a wide berth But for others the intrigue of seeing a monkey hang out on a beach or wander through a car park is too great Feeding the baboons is strictly prohibited not that the baboons know that They ll happily leap into an open car of an unsuspecting tourist to whip a picnic out of their hand Or they ll riffle through unattended bags on the Cape Point beaches whilst the owners look on flabbergasted from the ocean If you see baboons around roll up the windows and stash the snacks The tap water is drinkable Although at many restaurants youâ ll be asked whether youâ d like to kick off with still or sparkling the Cape Town tap water is perfectly safe to drink If you leave the city to visit smaller towns ask locally if they drink the water although generally water in the Western Cape is perfectly potable Learn to relax Cape Town takes things slow Â Lauren Mulligan Lonely Planet You can do your shopping at the robots English is one of South Africaâ s official languages but it does come with a few idiosyncrasies Take the robots These are not mechanical men but the local term for traffic lights More than just a place to stop or for some drivers to just carry on red light be damned and wait for the traffic robots are a hub of human activity Youâ ll see beggars here on a regular basis as well as traders selling everything from sunglasses to reindeer antlers The robots allow you to buy a sunhat shop for souvenirs grab some fresh veggies or replace that phone charger you left at your last guesthouse all from the comfort of your car First time visitors can feel a little anxious lowering their windows at the lights but if youâ re in the suburbs and you see a trader selling something you like itâ s a part of local life to see what they have To perfect the art of speed shopping be sure to have cash at hand Capetonians are not the most patient of drivers If you linger more than a few seconds after the robots turn green a symphony of horn honking will ensue Donâ t forget to tip Although expected amounts are not on a par with those in North America South Africa has a tipping culture and many workers will expect you to add a little something onto the bill In restaurants and bars is acceptable though is better Give to petrol pump attendants you canâ t pump your own gas in South Africa and to informal parking guards depending on the level of service they offer some barely glance at your car others will help you squeeze in and out of tight spaces Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local
