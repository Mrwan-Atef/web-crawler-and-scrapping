curved coastline and was formally dedicated as a World Surfing Reserve in Surfing has been steadily increasing in popularity and whether you re completely new to the sport or looking to perfect your

These surfing hotspots around the world are the best for beginners Start with the right surfing gear In the early after the successful neoprene experiments of University of California Berkeley physicist Hugh Bradner surfer and legendary wetsuit pioneer Jack O Neill began using neoprene to perfect his product The material proved to be ideal for surfing flexible lightweight and capable of trapping body heat O Neill who moved to Santa Cruz in was one of the first to sell these neoprene wetsuits commercially and helped to popularize them all over the world To this day wetsuits are a sure bet for keeping you comfortable year round while surfing Richard Schmidt a Santa Cruz native and owner of the city s original surf school has been entwined with the culture long enough to remember the evolution of the sport from body surfing on inflatable mats as a kid to attempting to stand on a Styrofoam board to finally riding a long board purchased from Otto s Board and Surf now closed These days Schmidt tells his students to start with a soft board If the board hits you or hits somebody else around you it s not so lethal The hard fiberglass boards can bruise and cut but soft boards are easy to ride and they re much safer Schmidt also explains that even though bigger surf boards might be more cumbersome to handle off the water they will give you more stability as you catch waves Related In Southern California surf culture is becoming more inclusive Pick the perfect surf spot Cowell Beach is steps from the site of where O Neill opened his second surf shop now the Dream Inn s Jack O Neill Restaurant Lounge that pays homage to the legendary surfer with personal memorabilia vintage photos hanging surf boards and surf art It s one of the best places for learning because of its long gentle rolling waves says Schmidt adding that because of its location within the bay the area is well protected from prevailing winds Similar surfing conditions can be found at Capitola Beach which is why there are no shortage of lesson options here Capitola Beach Company and the women owned Capitola Surf and Paddle offer daily lessons for beginners Respect the marine wildlife Santa Cruz surfers are no strangers to coming face to face with the marine life Even with laws in place like the Marine Mammal Protection Act that forbids humans from coming within feet of marine life sometimes the animals have a different plan Schmidt has surfed besides dolphins and even recalls being approached by a friendly newborn harbor seal while surfing with his two young sons But Schmidt acknowledges that as magical as that moment was touching the wildlife can be risky You never know how they will react Case in point the infamous Otter who bit scratched and stole surfboards during the summer of In her defense she was seen that fall with a new pup so scientists believe that her behavior was due to pregnancy hormones Elliott Hazen PhD research ecologist at Southwest Fisheries Science Center in Monterey California acknowledges there have been exploratory bites from sharks every few years Although central California beaches are known as nursery grounds for juvenile sharks Hazen says the upwelling season that happens in the area from spring to summer keeps the waters cool and act as a sort of barrier to sharks We are obviously entering their home and habitat The ocean is a wild place and an amazing resource in our backyard but you have to treat it with respect says Hazen The best bet is to surf during the middle of the day rather than at dawn or dusk when marine life are out feeding Let the ocean dictate your day Schmidt says the best surfing happens between October and March when storms move up the Pacific Ocean But the ocean is an unpredictable place and Hazen points out that climate change is creating even more extremes Although bigger storms and their waves might be a bonus for some surfers Hazen notes With more upwelling comes more acidic waters that affects the prey that species eat This means that animals like sharks might need to move further inland to find food Additionally with increased rainfall comes the possibility of harmful algae blooms that can be great for sea life food webs but give surfers itchy skin Even with the unpredictability of climate change there are ways to play it safe and read the ocean s mood In Santa Cruz you have to go for the low tides says Schmidt At high tide many of the beach access points are just waves banging against the cliffs and rocks You have to be an expert or a crab to crawl up and down Schmidt warns Beware of the sleeper waves Instead of running straight into the water Schmidt advises his students to stay on dry land for minutes to observe the ocean Sometimes you get these long period swells where it might be flat for minutes and all of sudden there s a bigger wave then they anticipated he says You can also do your research from home Schmidt s go to websites are the National Data Buoy Center which shows the buoy readings from Alaska to San Diego and StormSurf for the marine forecasts Surfing s health benefits Surfing is full of physical and mental health benefits From Schmidts perspective there s always something that needs to be done when you re on land pay your mortgage or run household errands All of that goes away when you put on your wetsuit jump on your board and start paddling You come out of the water feeling like you ve been rebooted This story was created with the support of Visit Santa Cruz County Megan Margulies an author and journalist based outside of Boston writes about
