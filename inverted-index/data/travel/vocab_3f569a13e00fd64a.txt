The real history of tartan from the Scottish Highlands to the streets of Tokyo TRAVEL The real history of tartan from the Scottish Highlands to the streets of Tokyo A new exhibition attempts to unravel the complicated legacy of the iconic checked cloth worn by rebels and royals alike In this archival photo a woman decorates tartan bonnets Known as plaid in the United States the iconic Scottish pattern is equally popular around the world Photograph by J Baylor Roberts Nat Geo Image Collection By Karen Gardiner March min read For many people a bright bolt of tartan epitomizes Scotland conjuring misty heather filled glens and bagpipers in Highland dress But for Scots the colorful pattern adorning kilts and bonnets a type of cap has a checkered past We love it and we hate it in equal measure says Mhairi Maxwell a curator at the V A Dundee the Scotland outpost of London s Victoria Albert Museum Worn by royalty and ruffians alike tartan has evoked both the traditional and the subversive throughout its history at times affirming Scottish identity and ridiculing it Now a major art exhibition at the V A Dundee opening this April will attempt to unravel the cloth s history and contradictions through Chanel dresses sculptural Donald Judd prints and East African shuka textiles The timing says Maxwell is right The debate that the exhibition surfaces is very contemporary she says relating to emerging topics of independence nationalism and our place in the world as well as decolonization and presenting a more global perspective on textiles Tartan s story is long and complicated but the cloth has proved surprisingly adaptable to the changing winds of politics and fashion From workwear to tourist souvenirs clans to catwalks and now a museum show here s how tartan

since at least the third century A D yet its precise origins are shrouded in mystery Unlike tweed tartan often called plaid in the United States uses a simple two over two twill weave to create a bright pattern of interlocking stripes a process that visitors can watch at mills in the Borders Highlands and Edinburgh Here s how tweed became a symbol of Scottish culture Traditionally made from wool the strong and hardwearing cloth was favored as practical everyday wear by Highlanders the largely Gaelic speaking clan societies of Scotland s north By the mid century the bold print became a symbol of allegiance to Charles Edward Stuart better known as Bonnie Prince Charlie who led an army of tartan wearing rebels known as Jacobites into England in It was the last in a series of Jacobite uprisings that attempted to topple Britain s Protestant King George II from the throne and restore the Catholic House of Stuart which had originated in Scotland After the Jacobites final defeat at Culloden in Highland dress the traditional clothing that reflected the region s rural environment was banned Among the prohibited garments were the phillabeg little kilt trews tartan tights and tartan patterned great trench coats But one of the greatest misunderstandings says Peter MacDonald historian and head of research and collections for Scottish Tartans Authority is that tartan was banned per se rather than only some patterned items Nevertheless because the Highlander was forced into Lowland dress the more tailored European clothing style of the period his everyday link to tartan was irrevocably severed MacDonald wrote in an essay The ban s repeal changed tartan forever A man in a kilt throws a pole in Glenfinnan during the Highland Games an annual sporting and cultural event held

Collection Tartan s brand power In King George IV attempted to demonstrate unity by appearing in full Highland dress during the crown s first visit to Scotland since before Culloden But the event sowed the seeds of what critics would later derisively call tartanry the excessive kitschy use to represent an overly romanticized picture of the country The essayist Tom Nairn bitingly blamed this tartan monster for stifling Scottish culture Twenty years after King George s wardrobe misstep Queen Victoria took tartanry to new heights with her purchase of Balmoral Castle Decorated in wall to wall tartan her weekend retreat solidified Scotland s transformation from a threat to a vacation destination Queen Victoria took the throne amid turmoil Here s how she held power The Highlands cleared of many of its inhabitants following Culloden were relegated into the wild and empty idyll of tourist brochures Scotland became a brand marketed by tartan mass produced and spread across the Empire by the British army into which Highlanders had been assimilated It was this commodification of tartan that youth culture subverted Punks including the Vivienne Westwood styled Sex Pistols wore tartan as a finger up to the establishment says Maxwell very much recognizing its political power Tartan she says is always worn to be seen and to be heard it s a loud pattern Fashion designer Alexander McQueen went further by consciously repoliticizing the cloth For his Highland Rape show he sent models some dressed in his Clan MacQueen tartan staggering down a heather strewn catwalk to demonstrate the destruction of the Highland people culture and land after Culloden In McQueen s hands tartan rebelled against tartanry This painting shows Britain s King George IV in full Highland dress Worn for the crown s first visit to Scotland since Culloden the look eventually led to what critics viewed as a kitschy representation of the textile Painting by David Wilkie Niday Picture Library Alamy Stock Photo Tartan today Walking along Edinburgh s souvenir shop lined Royal Mile it s clear that Scotland has not slayed the tartan monster At the same time businesses around the country are rethinking the complicated cloth Just a few miles from Balmoral in the Cairngorms the Fife Arms tartan carpets and wall coverings sit comfortably alongside contemporary international artwork collected by the hotel s Swiss gallerist owners Like the shape shifting beasts of Scottish folklore tartan is always changing Tartan is everything all the time says Maxwell and I think it s endured as a design and source of inspiration because it s got this tension Today tartan keeps evolving to meet new challenges including that of fashion s environmental impact Prickly Thistle describes its team as tartan rebels for their business approach which aims to tackle fast fashion and center sustainability The Highland textile mill crafts made to measure garments that are meant to last forever To encourage shoppers to buy less its core collection is on sale just four times a year Our evolution could be linked to the past says founder Clare Campbell pointing to the sustainability of natural fibers such as wool which are durable and require less washing Yet these days you don t have to go to Scotland to see tartan The enduring style staple has flourished elsewhere while remaining a symbol of Scotland It doesn t just represent Scottish identity it s equally Japanese Maxwell says pointing to both Japanese street style and runway looks In fact tartan is so popular in Japan the country hosted a major museum show about it years before Scotland Tokyo became a megacity by reinventing itself From recent collections by Saint Laurent and Kenzo to the edgy boutiques of Harajuku Tokyo and an Academy Award winning movie tartan is ubiquitous on the catwalk street and screen It s not only a Scottish symbol the Maple Leaf Tartan is an official national symbol of Canada as Canadian as the national anthem flag and beaver As much as it is about celebrating Scotland and Scottish identity it s really a global take on tartan says Maxwell of the V A s exhibition which highlights everything from French couture designers frequent use of tartan to tartan patterned Indian madras fabrics The exhibition she says is decentralizing the narrative of tartan It s now a global textile A group of girls dressed in
