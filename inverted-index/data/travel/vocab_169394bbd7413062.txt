People emerge from the metro stop in Gangnam Seoul â Â a city that has one of the best public transport networks in the world Antyony Wallace AFP via Getty Images Thereâ s so much to see and do in Seoul that you should count on covering some ground as you explore Luckily Seoulâ s clean punctual and accessibility focused public transport network ranks among the best in the world and getting around the capital of South Korea is smoother than ever thanks to several smartphone apps that provide real time information and integrated fare payment KakaoMap is available in English and can help you plan your journey from door to door covering everything from when the next bus will come to the most efficient train car to board Seoulâ s subway trains and buses all have free wi fi so you can keep track of your journey online even without a SIM card Advertisement From buses and bicycles to taxis and trains and your own two feet hereâ s the insider scoop on the best ways to get around Seoul Start with a transport pass which brings convenience and savings While Seoulâ s buses and trains are operated by several different companies you can pay for journeys with all operators with a transport pass There are three to choose from NAMANE T money and Cashbee You can get a physical NAMANE card from a kiosk at transport hubs or use a digital one via the app Top it up and use it across public transport as well as at some retailers You can purchase a T money and Cashbee card at convenience stores as well as transport hubs just top them up as you go to use on any public transport and affiliated retailers Keep in mind that T money is more widely accepted in stores than Cashbee While it is possible to buy a single ride ticket at the station each time or pay in cash on the bus this is uncommon Transport cards can be used in taxis subways and buses all over South Korea and visitors can buy T money in conjunction with other special deals for foreign tourists Because many of the cards have a special design or theme such as pictures of K pop group BTS many choose to keep the card as a souvenir If you donâ t want this you can get a refund for the cost of the card at Incheon International Airport when you leave the country Seoulâ s fast and efficient metro can zip you almost everywhere in the city PrasitRodphan Shutterstock The metro is the fastest and most affordable way to get around Seoul With subway lines making stops across the city the Seoul Metro is the most efficient way to get around the city To navigate all the lines and transfer points download the Metro app for iPhone or Android you should find the entire process quite straightforward Each station has English language signs and stops are announced in Korean English Chinese and Japanese Adult fares start at â US per ride with a transport pass each fare allows for up to four transfers to another subway bus or line within minutes If youâ re changing between one subway line and another you generally donâ t tap out to make transfers Platform screens detail what trains are due to arrive and depart and exit signs detail major adjacent landmarks The subway closes between midnight to though exact times vary by line Check the app for precise information Brush up on subway etiquette The unspoken but universally followed rules of etiquette are a big part of what makes Seoulâ s subway work so smoothly Most people line up outside the train doors and enter in an orderly manner Train cars usually have reserved seats for the elderly pregnant passengers and travelers with disabilities Visitors sometimes use these seats when available but itâ s considered good manners to leave these places empty for those in need Advertisement Seoul s color coded buses are a handy way to get to most parts of the capital Tupungato Shutterstock Seoulâ s buses can take you anywhere in the city While buses may take a little longer than the metro they can be a great option if youâ re traveling to a more residential area or if your subway route requires more than one transfer Plus they let you watch the city go by as you get from point A to point B Bus stops generally display routes in both Korean and English A digital screen shows when the next bus arrives and indicates how crowded the bus is The seat availability signage is only in Korean but itâ s color coded â comfortableâ is usually white â averageâ is yellow and â busyâ is red Bus stop signs also give weather and air quality information some bus stops even have seats that warm up in colder weather Seoul has five types of buses each color coded to indicate their purpose Green and blue buses cover cross town routes and an adult ticket costs â US The small green local buses known as maeul are about half the size of the regular green buses and they stick to just one neighborhood or district at a fare of â US Red buses travel between Seoul and outer regions and cost â US Yellow or circulator buses loop around popular tourist destinations such as Namsan and Myeong dong and cost â US You are allowed up to four transfers either to the subway or another bus for free within minutes Typically you tap in at the front door when you enter the bus and tap out at the back door when you exit Remember to tap out to secure your free transfers and discounts The queuing system is pretty loose for the bus during rush hour passengers often enter through the back door or exit through the front door â even though some bus drivers frown upon this practice Night buses are indicated by an N before the number and the fare is â US The etiquette of avoiding seats for the elderly pregnant and travelers with disabilities does not apply as it does on the subway though youâ ll be expected to give up your seat if someone needs it While itâ s easy to hail a cab in Seoul we donâ t recommend getting behind the wheel of a car yourself fornStudio Shutterstock Hail a taxi for late night journeys Seoul cabs come in many different shapes and sizes the most common being silver or orange mid size sedans that take a maximum of four passengers Cabs charge a base fare of â US plus increments of â US for every eighth of a mile The incremental price increases a little between and You can pay with a credit card cash or transport card There are a few Korean rideshare apps but you might need a valid Korean phone number to use them If you have a local number download Kakao T a popular app thatâ s available in English Cabs operated by International Taxi Service can be booked on the website or via phone or email but reservations are required hours in advance Otherwise you can hail cabs on the street Even if you are confident in your ability to pronounce your destination itâ s best to show a cab driver the name of your destination written in Korean since some places have similar names such as Sinchon Station and Sincheon Station If you need to explain your route in detail to your driver you can call a free interpretation hotline the number is usually indicated on a sticker on the window side of a cab If you donâ t see it for some reason try using the BBB app which is staffed by volunteers and available on both Apple and Android Be aware that many cab drivers are reluctant to take on short journeys and sometimes reject passengers for this reason To avoid this locals often get in and shut the door before telling the driver where theyâ re going We donâ t recommend driving your own car in Seoul Traffic in Seoul can be sheer gridlock and parking is cutthroat even by the standards of other huge cities Although you can rent a car with an international driverâ s license we donâ t recommend this for a short visit Bike share schemes and dedicated lanes make cycling an appealing way to get around Seoul Gw Nam Getty Images See the city up close on a bike Seoul has a handful of bike share schemes The best known and most accessible to non Koreans is Ttareungi with its distinctive white and green bicycles Visitors can create an account online and download the Seoul Bike app to use the system You can purchase hourly daily or yearly passes bicycles can be rented at one station and returned at another There are some useful dedicated cycling paths â including the Hangang River Cycling Trail which follows the Han River through the city â but many roads do not have a separated bike lane and cyclists often have to share the sidewalk with pedestrians Cyclists are required to dismount and walk across pedestrian crosswalks although this rule is not vigorously enforced ignoring it may make you liable in the event of an accident Thereâ s no substitute for walking through the crowded streets of Seoulâ s central districts fornStudio Shutterstock Walking is often the best option Since Seoul is an incredibly dense city â with shops restaurants and cultural sights often packed tightly together â getting around on foot has major rewards A walk of only miles will take you from Gyeongbokgung Palace the largest of the capitalâ s five grand palaces to Changdeokgung Palace often considered the most beautiful of the lot Between these two sights lie dozens of lesser known attractions and cafes such as the Arario Museum Cafe Onion and Seoul Museum of Craft Art â all of which youâ d miss if you took a cab bus or train Accessible transportation in Seoul With audio and visual information systems elevators Braille tiles accessible turnstiles and bathrooms at almost all subway stations across the city Seoul Metro is considered â mostly accessibleâ by organizations such as WheelchairTravel org If the elevators arenâ t working approach an attendant at the station to help you with a wheelchair lift to the train platform Priority seating is available for travelers with disabilities and train cars with wheelchair spaces are marked with a large green wheelchair decal on the floor Priority seating is also available on all of Seoulâ s buses almost all of which have a ramp or a floor that can be lowered for those with mobility needs For more information about accessible sightseeing and calling wheelchair accessible taxis check out Seoul Danurim an accessible travel
