Colorado River Photograph by Stephen Alvarez Nat Geo Image Collection TRAVEL Everything you need to know about Grand Canyon National Park Here s what to see and do when visiting the park millions of years in the making By Joe Yogerst January Why you should visit the Grand Canyon Leave it as it is declared U S President Teddy Roosevelt after a sojourn at the Grand Canyon You cannot improve on it The ages have been at work on it and man can only mar it More than a century later Arizona s Big Ditch continues to awe first time visitors and those who ve already been there a dozen times Not so much from sheer size although the dimensions are truly astounding but an incredible combination of colors shapes weather and wildlife How grand is it The massive gash in the Earth s surface stretches miles from east to west measures miles across at its widest point and plunges around one mile from the rim to the Colorado River As the elevation descends the park transitions from pristine evergreen forest to stark desert landscapes with billion years of geology Native Americans have lived in and around the canyon for at least years and Spanish explorers laid eyes upon the rift in the century But it wasn t until when John Wesley Powell and his team navigated the Colorado River through the canyon that it began to earn worldwide fame Fast forward to today when more than six million people a year visit Grand Canyon National Park to experience its incredible vistas hiking trails historic hotels and more Related Who mapped the Grand Canyon This forgotten female mountainee r Grand Canyon fast

the park Photograph by Derek Von Briesen Nat Geo Image Collection Where to find the best views in the park Grand Canyon aficionados debate which overlooks along the South Rim is best Mather Point near the main visitor center rustic Hermits Rest the aptly named Grandview Point or Moran Point with its view of Hance Rapids and Lipan Point where you can gaze down on that big bend in the Colorado River Inspired by the building style of the Ancestral Puebloan people legendary architect Mary Colter designed Desert View Watchtower in as a perch for an even higher view down into the canyon Eighty five steps lead to an observation deck that sits more than feet above the canyon floor past murals of ancient Native American life rendered by Hopi artist Fred Kabotie The North Rim s most spectacular viewpoint is Toroweap Overlook in the super remote Tuweep area Not for the faint of heart it s around feet straight down from the clifftop to the Colorado River Just getting to the overlook is a challenge the road is unpaved and studded with rocks that require a high clearance vehicle Related This new park gives different views of the Grand Canyon with no crowds Where to find the park s best trails Far and away the park s most popular hike is the Rim Trail which meanders along the canyon edge between the South Kaibab Trailhead near Yaki Point and Hermits Rest Nearly all of this trail is paved there s not a lot of elevation gain and there are lots of stops en route including the main visitor center the Yavapai Geology Museum Hopi House the El Tovar Hotel and Kolb Studio During the summer and weekends the Rim Trail is often wall to wall with people Those who prefer a short easy hike with solitude should try Shoshone Point The turnout doesn t overlook the canyon most cars whiz past it on their way to the money shot but the mile trail from the parking lot to the edge is one of the least crowded along the South Rim Trails on the North Rim are also less crowded Trailheads near the village usher hikers onto the Uncle Jim Loop miles the Widforss Trail miles to a secluded overlook and Ken Patrick Trail miles to Point Imperial the highest point on the North Rim with views into the canyon s remote and seldom visited northeast corner Hiking below the rim appeals to very few visitors less than percent venture away from the top But several spots lend themselves to a quick dip into the canyon including the South Kaibab Trail For those who don t want to trek the six plus miles to the canyon floor Ooh Aah Point about a third of the way down offers spectacular views Bright Angel Trail from the South Rim is the safest and best maintained route into the canyon and includes shade structures emergency phones toilets and taps for refilling water bottles With a trailhead just west of the South Rim Village the Bright Angel dives quickly via a series of switchbacks to Indian Garden miles and a suspension bridge over the Colorado River to Bright Angel Campground miles and nearby Phantom Ranch The only path into the canyon from the North Rim is the North Kaibab Trail a mile hoof down to Phantom Ranch and the river Several trails run lengthwise through the canyon including the rugged multi day Tonto Trail which wanders miles from east to west below the South Rim Two condors soar over the Colorado River near the Navajo Bridge in Marble Canyon Arizona Photograph by Dawn Kish Nat Geo Image Collection The best spots for seeing wildlife Elk are frequently seen along more secluded parts of the South Rim Trail and Desert View Road Even more common is the tassel eared Abert s squirrel which can be spotted just about anywhere along the rim The Grand Canyon harbors a healthy population of bighorn sheep but they are most likely seen while hiking deep into the canyon or running the Colorado River Mule deer and javelina wild pigs inhabit the ponderosa pine and pinyon juniper forests behind the rims and are sometimes seen around the campsites or beside roads One of the nation s largest unfenced bison herds roams the Kaibab Plateau behind the North Rim Overpopulation has led to reduction efforts and the transfer of more than bison to Native American lands in four prairie states since As a Globally Important Bird Area the park is home to known bird species ranging from the endangered California condor and Mexican spotted owl to frequently spotted creatures like ravens and Steller jays Every canyon viewpoint offers an excellent platform for scanning the sky for birds with a pair of binoculars How to visit the park like a National Geographic Explorer Paleobotanist Paul K Strother has visited the Grand Canyon numerous times over the past years on a quest for fossil spores that might reveal the early evolution of life on land Probing the Tonto Group on his first expedition in the mid he came across rocks in sediment similar to what he had already studied in Pennsylvania that contained early land plant spores I took those samples back and processed them and found they had microfossils in them Strother explains These microfossils had never been reported from those sequences in the Grand Canyon They re pretty old around half a billion years And very small they can only be seen in a microscope Strother hopes his research leads to a better understanding of the transition from water dwelling algae to the Earth s first land plants Strother normally spent a week or two with a small team gathering specimens in the canyon Just like everyone else he needed backcountry permits to camp overnight But unlike hikers he also needed permission from the Park Service to remove rocks something that s normally forbidden Their biggest challenge to surviving multiple days in the canyon was water We had to send someone running down to Phantom Creek every day to collect water The expeditions often took Strother off trail into parts of the Grand Canyon rarely if ever visited by other humans I m most impressed with the idea of walking around in the desert and thinking that no one s ever been there before Because there s no reason even for the Anasazi or other original inhabitants Philosophically you think about being alone and it being so quiet Native Americans have lived in the Grand Canyon for over years and remain permanent residents inside the national park Packers and tourists are seen here riding into the canyon towards the village of Supai part of the Havasupai Indian Reservation Photograph by Mark Peterson Redux Top experiences in the Grand Canyon With its exhibits on the park s natural and human history the Grand Canyon Visitor Center on the South Rim is an excellent starting point Visitors can leave their vehicles there and walk bike or take a shuttle bus to other landmarks along the South Rim Right behind the visitor center are Mather Point and the mile Rim Trail to other stunning viewpoints like Yaki Point to the east and Yavapai Point to the west where a geology museum illuminates nearly two billion years of canyon history Beyond Yavapai Point miles is Grand Canyon Village and the eclectic architecture of its national historic landmark district Many of the buildings were designed by pioneering female architect Mary Colter including the distinctive Hopi House an homage to the indigenous architecture of the Southwest that now houses the park s largest souvenir store and a Native American art gallery Verkamp s Visitor Center features a bookstore information desk and exhibits on the canyon s pioneer history Among other noteworthy structures are the Kolb Studio and Lookout Studio vintage photo studios that now blend shopping and exhibit space During the slower winter months visitors can drive to Hermits Rest But during the busy peak season March to November Hermit Road is closed to private vehicles west of the village That leaves hiking biking and the shuttle bus as the three ways to explore this awesome seven mile stretch of the South Rim Must see stops include the Abyss with its foot vertical drop off and Pima Point where you can see a slice of the milk chocolate colored Colorado River far below At the end of the road Hermits Rest is a faux frontier cabin host to a gift shop and snack bar fashioned by Colter in Tucked between viewpoints on Desert View Road is the small but interesting Tusayan Museum with exhibits on local Native American culture Behind the museum a short self guided trail leads to the Tusayan Ruin the remains of a century Puebloan village and one of archaeological sites so far identified inside the national park Nearby Desert View Watchtower another Colter masterpiece compliments its astonishing views with a trading post grocery store deli gas station and campground Related How to take amazing photos of the Grand Canyon From Desert View Watchtower the drive to the Grand Canyon s North Rim is nearly miles via the Navajo Nation But it s a journey into a different world For starters the North Rim averages a thousand feet higher than its southern counterpart That extra elevation makes a huge difference in climate vegetation and even the animals you come across The North Rim is slightly cooler in the summer and often inaccessible during winter because of snowstorms Tourist facilities are usually open only from May to October Grand Canyon Lodge balances on the very edge of the chasm and its back patio offers perhaps the best place in the entire park to sit stare and contemplate the geological wonder that spreads out before you For an even more vertiginous view hike the short mile trail to Bright Angel Point Given the absence of roads there are only three ways to explore the Grand Canyon below the rims hiking mule trips and river flat trips Around people a year backpack into the canyon for overnight stays that can vary from one night to several weeks Far more people are day hikers who venture a short distance down one of three main trails for a taste of what it s like to stare up at the imposing canyon walls Whether on a multi day trek or an hour long hike walkers should always check out trail and weather conditions before plunging down the path The most timely and accurate information is available from the national park visitor centers or the Backcountry Information Center on the South Rim Mule trips into the canyon kick off from both rims The South Rim features day trips and multi day pack trips with overnights at Phantom Ranch the North Rim offers only day rides into the canyon Sixteen companies own concessions from the Park Service to run float trips down the Colorado River between Lees Ferry and Diamond Creek A full list of river rafts is posted here Located on Native American lands two spots along the western edge of the south rim offer vastly different Grande Canyon Adventures Renowned for its waterfalls and aquamarine swimming holes Havasu Canyon offers year round camping and lodging inside the Havasupai Indian Reservation The Skywalk at Eagle Point offers the ultimate vertigo experience a horseshoe shaped glass walkway on the Hualapai Indian Reservation that hangs feet above the canyon Above the Grand Canyon and the Desert View Watchtower stargazers can look at the night sky to see Jupiter The Pleiades Star Cluster upper right of Jupiter and the bright star Capella seen above the tower Photograph by Babek Tafreshi Nat Geo Image Collection Best things to do for families If your kids are into action rent a muscle powered cycle or e bike from Bright Angel Bicycles near the main visitor center and take off along the eastern part of the Rim Trail the road to Hermits Rest or the mile Greenway Trail between Grand Canyon Village and Tusayan town Scramble to the top of Desert View Watchtower for a bird s eye view of the canyon or walk a short distance of the Bright Angel or South Kaibab trails far enough into the chasm to admire the colossal walls from below Children nine years of age and older can undertake mule trips down to Phantom Ranch and the Colorado River The minimum age for whitewater rafting through the canyon varies between eight and depending on the length and difficulty of the river trip The park offers a wide range of family friendly ranger programs that range from fossil walks and astronomy nights to Diné Navajo cultural encounters and an Endangered Ranger talk The Grand Canyon Railway from Williams Arizona features singing cowboys and a mock train robbery with thieves on horseback riding up beside the passenger cars Even before traveling to the park kids can learn more about the Grand Canyon through a series of
