Share The hilltop village of DeiÃ Mallorca Tain Nattapong Shutterstock Balearic Island queen Mallorca is so much more than the sum of its reputation as a fly and flop beach destination in the Med This island has real magic up its sleeves â from capital Palma with its booming food scene backstreet patios and Gothic goliath of a cathedral to long distance hiking trails that pick their way over the Serra de Tramuntanaâ s wind scoured limestone peaks honey stone hilltowns that could rival any in Europe for beauty and coastal road trips that send heart rates and souls soaring Art by Picasso and Chopin piano recitals pilgrimage trails to lonely monasteries in the quiet hinterland â youâ ll find the lot here Here are our favorite things to do on the island to get you started but stray away from the crowds and you really should and youâ re bound to find your own Explore Cap de Formentor Mallorca ramps up the coastal drama big time where it slings its northern hook into the brilliant blue Med Here knife edge cliffs and the wind scarred limestone peaks of the Serra de Tramuntana rear up like waves on the point of breaking Every snaking bend along the Cap de Formentor peninsula will want to make you lunge for your camera As will the beach at Platja de Formentor a pine flanked ribbon of pale sand shelving gently into crystal clear water Go for a dip or hire paddleboards or kayaks to explore Local tip Arrive by boat from Port de PollenÃ a or by car on the helter skelter road along Cap de Formentor stopping at viewpoints like the Mirador del Mas Pas The lighthouse topping the headland delivers peachy sunsets Advertisement Cala Mesquida Martin Valigursky Shutterstock Flop on east coast beaches Eastern Mallorca smuggles away some of the islandâ s prettiest and least developed playas The bays and crescent shaped coves near Cala Ratjada entice with soft creamy sands and startlingly turquoise waters framed by pine flanked cliffs and sand dunes Loveliest of the lot are Cala Mesquida Cala Mitjana and Cala Matzoc particularly if you arrive early in the day and avoid the peak season rush Local tip Bring plenty of water and a picnic onto the circular mile walking trail from Cala Agula near Cala Ratjada which leads through the pines of a nature reserve to dune flanked Cala Mesquida En route look out for Talaia de Son Jaume II a century watchtower built to ward off pirate attacks Ride the rails on Ferrocarril de Winging you back to a bygone era the vintage wood panelled Ferrocarril de from Palma to has been rattling along the mountain tracks since Playing up the joy of slow travel the hour long journey is one youâ ll want to write home about delivering a wonderful hit of rural pre dawn of tourism Mallorca as the train chugs past lemon and orange orchards farms fields and carob olive and almond groves ravines and lost in time villages like Bunyola before emerging into the foothills of the towering Serra de Tramuntana Planning tip From April to October trains run from Palma to six times a day There is a reduced service in November December February and March with four trains per day in each direction Buy tickets ahead in peak season Left The village of DeiÃ Frank Lambert Shutterstock Right Hilltop DeiÃ cinoby Getty Images Find the poetic dream in DeiÃ Mallorca isnâ t short on the kind of villages that hoover up Instagram likes but crazily lovely DeiÃ on the islandâ s northwest coast has the edge with honey colored terracotta tiled bougainvillea draped houses pasted to a steep hillside Clasped between the bright blue Med and the lushly wooded peaks of the Serra de Tramuntana this aerie like village sits among orchards almond and olive groves vegetable gardens and vineyards like a modern day Eden DeiÃ â s beauty has long been feted by artistic souls not least British poet Robert Graves who adored it so much he built his dream house with his partner American poet Laura Riding here in Now you can visit it at the time capsule Casa de Robert Graves before reading or writing some poetry of your own during the mountain facing Poetsâ Walk at Belmond La Residencia Detour Tack on a visit to Son Marroig a lavish mansion that once belonged to Habsburg Archduke Ludwig Salvator with romantic views out to sea from the gardens Here you can ask for permission to walk the mile path through olive grove and pine down to Sa Foradada a bizarre hole in the rock that resembles an elephant from certain angles Hike the Ruta de Pedra en Sec Wild jagged and scarred by elemental forces over millennia the dramatically sculpted limestone peaks of Mallorcaâ s UNESCO World Heritage Serra de Tramuntana run like a knobbly backbone across the islandâ s north The range is a hikerâ s dream with summits crags and ravines that can only be explored on foot There are many day treks to give you a taster including a challenging mile stomp from Valldemossa that ticks off an ascent of Puig del Teix with broad views over mountain and sea For a deeper dive go for the big one the long distance Ruta de Pedra en Sec or which stretches miles from Port dâ Andratx to Port de PollenÃ a and takes the entire Serra de Tramuntana in its stride Walking on well signposted medieval cobbled paths hemmed by drystone walls youâ ll often find yourself alone in silent olive groves atop crags where nimble footed Mallorcan goats leap and at lookouts revealing fiery sunsets out at sea Advertisement Local tip Though not technically difficult the Ruta de Pedre en Sec hike is moderately challenging crossing steep rugged terrain Tackle the trail in the cooler months as the summer heat can be intense There are village B Bs refugis simple mountain lodges and hilltop monasteries where you can stay overnight The Cicerone guide is a handy companion Catedral de Mallorca Palma Wolfgang Jargstorff Shutterstock Marvel at Catedral de Mallorca in Palma Flinging up above the sea in a riot of golden stone soaring pinnacles and flying buttresses Palmaâ s whopping great Gothic cathedral is unmissable â in every possible sense of the word Built upon the ruins of a Muslim mosque in the cathedralâ s interior is a temple of light with pillars rising to support a great ribbed vault Look out for the striking crown of thorns canopy over the altar bearing the hallmark of Antoni GaudÃ and Miquel Barcelo s Chapel of the Holy Sacrament a ceramic wonder telling the miracle of the loaves and fishes Arrive at the cathedral nice and early to see the morning light stream through the rose window which is Europeâ s largest and rainbow light patterns dance across the vaulted interior Climb up to the roof terraces for a closer look Detour Right next door â and just as special â is the Palau de l Almudaina originally an Islamic alcÃ zar Muslim era fortress converted into a royal residence in the late century and now the King of Spainâ s plush summer digs The cathedral is also a terrific starting point for nudging deeper into the Sa Calatrava quarter of Palma once the heart of the old medina Stay in a monastery Forget the coast itâ s by heading off piste and striking out on foot into Mallorcaâ s rugged mountainous interior that youâ ll really touch the islandâ s soul And thereâ s no better way to immerse yourself nature and find a proper slice of away from it all Mallorcan life than by bedding down in one of the islandâ s old monasteries or hermitages where itâ s so quiet can hear an olive plop or distant goat bells tinkle There are many scattered all over the island but our favorites include hilltop Santuari de la Mare de DÃ u des Puig a former medieval nunnery reached by a stiff hour long hike through holm oak pine and olive from PollenÃ a pilgrimsâ refuge Monestir de Lluc high in the Tramuntana and Ermita de La a crisply converted century hermitage on a peninsula near AlcÃºdia with glorious coastal trails on its doorstep Local tip Advance booking is always a good idea especially in high season May to September Left Forn del Santo Cristo in Palma Rostislav Glinsky Shutterstock Right Traditional Mallorcan almond cake bonn bonn foto Shutterstock Dig into a Mallorcan feast in Palma Palma de Mallorca is now on the map as one of the most exciting places for food in the Med But where to begin For island produce and a vibrant hit of market life graze your way around Mercat de lâ Olivar where stalls heave with cheese fish meat fruit and veg plump olives and wafer thin serrano Youâ ll also find tapas and freshly shucked oysters to nibble on Bigging up stunning ingredients from the sea mountains meadows farms and orchards the cityâ s chefs are turning out menus with newfound flair and creativity some reaching for Michelin star status In a former century convent March Fosh is the table to book well ahead putting imaginative riffs on clean bright Balearic flavors Equally superb is AdriÃ n Quetglas with dishes that sing with island produce such as turbot with peas Tramuntana lemon and lemon verbena For elevated tapas in a grown up monochrome space swing over to La Bodeguilla run by two brothers Here meltingly tender suckling pig is the star of the produce led menu Local tip Donâ t leave without biting into an ensaÃ mada a flaky feather light snail shaped pastry dusted with icing sugar Old school Ca n Joan de S Aigo and Forn del Santo Cristo bake the best See Picasso and in Cradled by citrus orchards and the Serra de Tramuntanaâ s towering limestone peaks the ochre stone town of in Mallorcaâ s northwest would win on looks alone but you come here for culture The townâ s historic center is a beauty with alleys lined with grand merchantsâ houses leading to plazas like cafe rimmed PlaÃ a de la Here youâ ll be drawn to the EsglÃ sia de Sant Bartomeu a striking baroque church that was given a modernist makeover by Joan a protÃ gÃ of Antoni GaudÃ s art stash could rival that of many major cities with top billing going to Ca n Prunera showing works by Joan Picasso Gauguin Toulouse Lautrec and Klimt in a modernist mansion More surprising however is Sala Picasso Sala at s train station where you can marvel at bold Picasso ceramics swirling with women and bullfighters and eye catching prints by Catalan master â and all for free Local tip s charms havenâ t gone unnoticed and the town heaves in peak summer Come in spring or autumn for a more low key visit The MA road to Sa Calobra Shutterstock Drive the helter skelter road to Sa Calobra You might want to say a quick prayer before turning off the MA road that whips through the heights in Mallorcaâ s north and swerving onto the MA down to Sa Calobra This hair raising heart pumping knuckle whitening brake screeching mile road is a beauty but its looping hairpin bends are only for fearless drivers The road is the tour de force of Italian engineer Antonio Paretti who built it in Translating as the Snake it twists and turns just like one skirting narrow ridges and getting perilously close to the edge as it dips down to a ravine that carves through the wild ragged peaks of the Tramuntana to the cold deep sapphire blue sea Think driving it is tough Try scaling it by mountain bike like Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins who for the record pedalled up it in just minutes Local tip Sa Calobraâ s beach gets insanely crowded in high summer Come early or late in the day or for slightly more peace go one beach over to Cala Tuent a turquoise cove in the shadow of Puig Major Tune into Chopin in Valldemossa With arresting views of the wooded slopes of the Tramuntana and terraced hillsides the honey stone alley woven flower strewn village of Valldemossa is ludicrously pretty â but here good looks also equate to popularity so whatever you do arrive bright and early before the daytrippers â preferably in low season The romance of Valldemossa is all wrapped up in the Real Cartuja a grand Carthusian monastery that has been home to kings monks and century stars composer and legendary pianist FrÃ dÃ ric Chopin and his partner the French novelist George Sand The pair spent the winter of here Entry includes hourly piano recitals Local tip Time your visit to catch the Pianino Festival which kicks off in March and runs through summer where classical music performances of Chopinâ s works some on his original piano are held in Valldemossa s Real Cartuja Calvari stairway in PollenÃ a Jose Arcos Aguilar Shutterstock Climb PollenÃ aâ s Calvari Caught between the mountains of the Serra de Tramuntana and the sea in the islandâ s north PollenÃ a is never lovelier than in the honey glow of late afternoon when you duck into narrow alleyways full of beauty and banter or pull up a chair on one of the cafe terraces rimming the PlaÃ a Major and watch kids play in the shadow of Gothic baroque EsglÃ sia de la Mare de DÃ u dels Ã ngels As the heat of the day subsides itâ s also the time to climb the Calvari Calvary founded by the Knights Templar in the century to protect Christians who made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem after its conquest Take a breath then climb the steps to the tiny chapel at the top past cypress trees and stone crosses At the top far reaching views over the townâ s rooftops to the mountains beyond unfold Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Spain Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers Everywhere
