Most of us are just used to flicking a switch when we want to make a coffee but kahve is not your ordinary filtered brew Great pride and ceremony still goes into making this traditional drink and getting the perfect cup requires patience and skill Firstly the finest beans usually the aromatic arabica variety are chosen and finely ground The ground coffee is then added to water and sugar and cooked â never brought to a full boil â over a low heat in a cezve The foam is the sign of a good Turkish coffee and is usually removed The coffee is then brewed again and poured into a dainty cup called a fincan often with an ornate silver cup holder Something sweet on the side Locals will often serve their coffee with a piece of lokum or baklava â a match made in heaven for the pungent brew

sweet around two teaspoons per cup Coffee is generally served with a glass of water which lets you cleanse your palate while allowing the coffee to cool Because of the fine grind and long brewing time Turkish coffee can be mouth puckeringly strong and packs a hard caffeine punch so go easy and sip it slowly The coffee is served with the grounds so stop drinking before you reach the sludgy sediment at the bottom of the cup or swish to remix the grounds with the water Finding fortune in the beans You might think that coffee works enough magic as a morning caffeine fix but there is more to these beans than meets the eye â or so say a new generation of coffee fans who are reviving the ancient harem art of tasseography or fortune telling by reading the leftover coffee grounds The ritual involves swirling the grounds around quickly upturning the cup onto the saucer and making a wish The grounds reveal patterns and symbols that can be interpreted as meaning different things â a bird for good news an evil eye for bad energy or envy or flames for new love for instance If youâ re into this in a big way you might want to buy some beans brew up a Turkish coffee and give it a whirl
