Castle Wales Billy Stock Shutterstock Wye Valley Best for road trip romance Start Chepstow End Ross on Wye miles You could easily dash through it in an hour or two but donâ t Devote a long weekend to this stunning road trip through the thickly forested river woven Wye Valley snug against the Welsh English border Itâ s a valley so delightful that even great Romantics like Turner Coleridge and Wordsworth were smitten by its deep gorges plunging cliffs ancient broadleaf woods and ruined abbeys and castles Begin on a high at the formidable ruins of medieval Chepstow Castle perched on a limestone crag The river twists and turns north to Lower Wyndcliff where you should break from the wheel to puff up steps to the Eagleâ s Nest for riveting views over the Forest of Dean to the Severn Bridge Cotswolds and Mendips Driving north along the youâ ll want to stop in Tintern to explore the Gothic ruins of its abbey and hike up to the knife edge cliffs of the Devilâ s Pulpit where myth has

the orchards of Herefordshire and you arrive in the market town of Ross on Wye Planning tip Come in spring to see a riot of daffodils and bluebells on walks in the valley in summer to tag on a paddle

mountain scenery Start Cardiff End Conwy miles Advertisement Shining a light on the verdant oft overlooked heart of Wales as it slices from south to north through patchwork quilted fields forests and

filled National Museum of Wales and architecturally striking Bay as itâ s the last fix youâ ll have for a while Slip behind the wheel and things almost instantly take a turn for the wilder as you drive north through the fin like peaks glacier scoured hollows and waterfall splashed valleys of Bannau Brycheiniog the Brecon Beacons perhaps hoofing up the highest mountain Pen y Fan From here the drive swings north into the lonely bracken cloaked moors and wooded heights of the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales where when you switch the engine off itâ s often silent enough to hear your own heartbeat or the rumble of a distant tractor Stay overnight in Rhayader gateway to the Elan Valley with its rugged reservoirs and phenomenal stargazing Make sure to get plenty of rest before ramping

Starry night sky over Llanthony Priory Arthur Cauty Shutterstock Black Mountains Best for remote wilderness Start end Hay on Wye miles Even if you have to negotiate single track roads dodge unruly sheep on the lanes or trundle behind a pootling tractor you ll want to go slow on this short but sweet drive It starts and ends in the bookish town of Hay on Wye on the banks of the River Wye and snakes deep into the rugged moody Black Mountains From Hay on Wye the road narrows to a single track twisting steeply up to forlorn heathery moors as it traverses the Gospel Pass Walesâ highest road at with the Black Mountains on the horizon and wild ponies grazing the heights Look east to glimpse Hay Bluff and England Thereâ s an almost reverent hush in the remote Vale of Ewyas â the inspiration for Bruce Chatwinâ s novel On the Black Hill Patchworked hills rise up either side of the valley as you pass the whitewashed chapel of Capel y Ffin with its lopsided belfry Allow plenty of time to see the evocative ruins of Augustinian Llanthony Priory which mesmerized Romantic painters and poets â Turner among them Beyond the small village of Llanvihangel Crucorney civilization reemerges as you reach the food loving market town of Abergavenny topped by a ruined castle The west out of town brings you to the picture book village of Crickhowell Shortly after youâ ll bear right to reach Tretower

miles between the remote moor rimmed towns of Tregaron and Llanwrtyd Wells deep in the wilds of Mid Wales but they are gear crunching head spinning grab the camera miles you will never forget Your GPS might draw a blank on this off grid road trip but itâ s less about what you see and more about the drive itself Get behind the wheel in the serene stone built town of Tregaron and youâ re in for a back to nature treat as you head through the mossy oak woods of Nant Irfon National Nature Reserve En route youâ ll pass the most remote phone box in Wales Here you should start summoning the nerve

heathery mountains swoop down to the banks of the burbling River Irfon With no phone signal itâ s a place that feels immune to time and trends Youâ ll end your drive in hard to pronounce Llanwrtyd Wells famous for being both Britainâ s smallest town and the host of Walesâ wacky events like Augustâ s World Bog Snorkelling Championships Detour When in Tregaron donâ t miss the chance to visit
