Stuart Nov min read Share This five day itinerary goes from Bangkok to the islands in the Gulf of Thailand and onwards to the Andaman Coast Saowakhon Brown Getty Images For those looking to spend just under a week in Thailand the most difficult choice is whether you head north to the mountains of Chiang Mai or make a beeline for the beach and spend the next few days sipping fresh coconuts along the Andaman Coast Unfortunately even those who have lived here for decades like myself still struggle with this decision So taking Bangkok as the logical starting point do you look north to cooler climes or dream of curling your toes in sun warmed sand With more than five days in Thailand you could easily do both thanks to countless cheap internal flights For this short itinerary though we re going to focus on replenishing our vitamin D levels by traveling south to the easily accessible islands A tuk tuk ride is a quintessential Bangkok experience iStock Advertisement When to arrive Flights into Suvarnabhumi International Airport land at all times of day and night and thereâ s always transport available Additionally taxis and minibuses will take you to almost anywhere in the country for the right price How to get from the airport If you prefer to stay a night in Bangkok before hitting the road taxi ranks and Grab taxi pickup spots are your best door to door options while shuttle buses deliver passengers to main city arteries Alternatively head to the basement floor and jump on the cheap and fast Airport Rail Link straight into Phaya Thai Getting around town Whichever â townâ you find yourself in youâ ll not be able to miss the allure of a tuk tuk ride Barter a price you re happy with and enjoy the ride knowing you canâ t get a moment like this anywhere else For every other occasion taxi apps like Grab and Bolt offer a cheap and safe option thatâ s super convenient too What to pack Whether you opt for the north or the south shorts flip flops loose tees summer dresses and a cool pair of shades are a fail safe collection for any tropical holiday Thais love taking selfies so if you wanna join the masses bring a nice outfit or two to look good on the gram Outfits aside pack a big bottle of sunscreen and maybe some ear plugs â Thailand has a habit of being noisy even during the wee hours Leave at home It may sound counterintuitive but mosquito spray is plentiful here Every outdoor restaurant or bar will have a communal bottle at hand and every corner shop has a dozen brands to choose from Explore Bangkok s many temples and palaces before hopping on an overnight bus heading south Shutterstock Day Busy Bangkok Morning Love it or hate it Bangkok is the starting hub for many Thailand adventures Be efficient with your time and jump in a taxi and head straight to Khao San Rd â but weâ re not here for the bars In the morning the street is a calm food filled haven perfect for satiating any Thai food craving you canâ t suppress for a moment longer Once nicely full of pad thai and mango sticky rice drop your bags at one of the many tour operator offices and book yourself a night bus ticket southbound This will save you time and the cost of a hotel which you ll appreciate as you wake up a stone s throw from the beach albeit a little tired from the journey How to spend the day While youâ re here you might as well make the most of your day in Bangkok If youâ ve got the time pack in a tour of the cityâ s famous temples and palaces Work out the knots from a long flight by the hands of spiritual masseuses in the birthplace of Thai massage Wat Pho before meandering your way towards the Grand Palace and the nearby Temple of the Emerald Buddha be sure to cover your shoulders and knees before entering for some sightseeing Alternatively skip the temples and head straight to Chatuchak Weekend Market closed Monday and Tuesday to stock up on new beachwear and to get your souvenir shopping over and done with â if youâ re anything like me leaving it to the last minute spells disaster The bars and food stalls that line both sides of Bangkok s Khao San Rd continue to draw visitors for a night out Kritsaroot Udkwae Shutterstock Dinner Keep close to wherever youâ ll catch the bus from to avoid any traffic induced mishaps and grab a bite to eat along the lesser known Phra Athit Rd a popular hang out spot for locals with a nice selection of Thai restaurants snack attack cafes and moody jazz bars For authentic city food Karim Roti Mataba is one of the cityâ s oldest and best known restaurants that sits opposite the beautifully maintained Phra Sumen Fort Advertisement After dark If youâ re not boarding a bus towards the islands by this point Khao Sanâ s endless bars make most sense for those looking to party whereas Chinatown one of the worldâ s largest erupts into a foodie heaven Phenomenal seafood grills amazing Chinese Thai delicacies and endless back sois streets packed with old school Thai shophouses maintain an old world charm despite its rolling modernization For a fancier night out Chinatownâ s Soi Nana is home to some unique bars like Teens of Thailand and Tep Bar that serve local liquor in fancy cocktails setting the scene for a great five days to follow Ko Samui is the most developed of the islands in the Gulf of Thailand Anton Gvozdikov Shutterstock Day The Gulf of Thailand Morning Here you have a choice of three islands Ko Samui Ko Tao or Ko Pha Ngan Depending on the bus you chose youâ ll either disembark at Chumphon Pier that connects directly to the ferry terminal or further south in Surat Thani where thereâ ll be taxis and tuk tuk drivers eagerly waiting to take you to Don Sak Pier Chumphon Pier has a longer ferry ride that stops at Ko Tao first and Ko Samui last while from Don Sak Pier offers a choice of two direct ferries to Ko Samui and Ko Pha Ngan How to spend the day All equally beautiful and easy to get to take your pick based on the vibe you crave and stick to your guns Youâ ll want to be here for a few days after all that traveling Ko Samui is larger and more developed than the others with a mall and airport for those who want to skip the bus ride and fly straight into paradise A big time all rounder youâ ll find most major hotel chains and a wide variety of atmospheres from private beach escapes to bustling party corners Chaweng and Lamai both offer good food drinks and shopping but the latter is smaller and significantly more picturesque Mae Nam in the north and Ao Phang Ka in the southwest are more laid back while the Big Buddha and surrounding jungles are rich and ready for exploration Ko Pha Ngan attracts thousands of revelers for its Full Moon Parties Getty Images Ko Pha Ngan is most famous for its Full Moon parties that draw tens of thousands of young travelers during peak season but thereâ s much more to this island than beach parties and buckets of whisky Unspoilt coves and peaceful private resorts populate the rest of the island while hikes to Domsila Viewpoint offer superb panoramic views over the island But if you re here to get your full moon on cover yourself in neon paint and head for Hat Rin Nok Ko Tao offers a more tranquil and calm beach experience perfect for lazy couples and families Beautiful bays alternative cafes and a huge scuba diving scene make it an easy choice for some while the hiking trails and surprising amount of rock climbing double down the decision for more adventurous types Hat Sairee or Sairee Beach on the west coast is the longest and most developed part of the island but donâ t expect much compared to its bigger sisters Break up the beach day with a hike to Na Muang Waterfall on Ko Samui Chinnaphong Mungsiri Getty Images Day Relax in the sun How to spend the day Pack your bag and head to the beach of your choice for a well deserved rest day Mornings start a little slow on the islands so enjoy a lie in and donâ t expect to find good coffee anytime before Whichever island you opted for expect to indulge on fresh coconuts and delicious seafood in restaurants along beachfronts while the sea glistens with soft white waves and the metallic sheen of jet skis motorboats and parasails â all easy to rent â offering endless fun If youâ re still craving adventure and like me canâ t sit still hike your way to Na Muang Waterfall Ko Samui and cool off in the freshwater float around in rubber rings in the oasis that is Paradise Waterfall Ko Pha Ngan or try your luck at the Treasure Island Challenge Ko Tao Railay a world class climbing destination can only be reached by boat Dmitry Molchanov Shutterstock Day The Andaman Coast Morning Say your farewells to the island and set off on the early boat back to the mainland in search of the Andaman Coast The most cost effective options are ferry bus combo tickets that you can buy directly from hotels tour operators or at the pier itself but if youâ re catching the or catamaran best to buy the day before How to spend the day Depending on your ticket you can make it across the mainland to Krabi in sub three hours but expect a little delay here and there As one of the most beautiful provinces in Southern Thailand take the time to appreciate the mainlandâ s towering karst formations white sand beaches and crystal clear turquoise waters Hat Railay and Hat Ton Sai are technically still part of the mainland but are only accessible by boat as this idyllic paradise is surrounded by towering limestone cliffs on all sides but the coast Itâ s these cliffs that make Railay as itâ s affectionately known a world class climbing destination Expect it to be busy in peak season While staying the night is ideal hotels tend to be on the more expensive side and fill up fast due to limited space If you find yourself without a room thereâ s always rows of longtail boats parked up on the beach waiting to ferry people back to Ao Nang or Krabi Town running services well into the night Dinner There are a few wonderful spots to eat at Railay The most exquisite has to be the Grotto found tucked inside a private cave formation overlooking the iconic sea erupting karst Ko Rang Nok Itâ s only accessible to guests of Rayavadee the â islandâ sâ most expensive resort For those without that luxury Coco Restaurant serves some of the freshest Thai food on the island A perfect place to fill your belly before grabbing a few beers and a plastic mat lying back and stargazing on Railay Beach Visit in the right season just before the monsoon and bioluminescent plankton may shimmer back at you too an incredible natural phenomena thatâ s got to be seen to be believed If you have time take a quick trip to Ko Phi Phi and snorkel in Maya Bay John Harper Getty Images Day Phi Phi Phuket or Krabi How to spend the day Depending on your return flight either early or leisurely exits will be on the cards If you have most of the day jump on a ferry to Ko Phi Phi and find yourself snorkeling in the famous Maya Bay by lunchtime It should be noted that while Maya Bay from The Beach fame is undeniably beautiful it has been perennially overtouristed leading to the occasional closure most recently during the rainy season from August to September So it might be wise to double check plans From there take a ferry to Phuket for some high end shopping and a fancy meal before boarding a domestic flight back to Bangkok from Phuket International Airport Alternatively stay Krabi side and charter a longtail boat with â â Big Tour Krabi to take you on a whirlwind tour of Ko Tan Ming Puya Bay Chicken Island Tup Island Poda Island and the incredible Thale Waek â a stunning white sand beach that only appears in low tide Back to the mainland a short trip to the airport puts you on the trajectory back home Or you could stay a few more nightsâ your boss
