perimeter The Sunday morning Szimpla Kert farmers market has become a Budapest institution Sarah Coghill Lonely Planet Farmers markets Farmers markets in Budapest feel more like a street festival than a shopping experience probably helped by the fact that they occupy some of the cityâ s most popular bars on weekend mornings The most famous market pops up every Sunday morning at the iconic Szimpla Kert ruin bar complete with live music and a charity cook off Get there early or prepare to try slivers of craft cheese amid the jostling crowd For something more low key head over to Ã lesztÅ a large

the field next to the MOM Park shopping centre Advertisement PÃ linka fruit brandy bottles lined up at Magyar PÃ linka HÃ za store in Budapest Richard Nebesky Lonely Planet Food and drink Beyond the market halls you can buy food and drink as gifts or souvenirs all over the city Hungarian wine is a popular gift and you can have some fun by booking a tasting at the Tasting Table before choosing that perfect bottle â or just drop by for a chat with one of the sommeliers If youâ re a fan of spirits pay a visit to the Zwack Museum Visitorsâ Centre to learn about the iconic Hungarian bitters taste from the barrel and buy an orb like bottle or two at the large shop afterward Those who donâ t like bitter drinks can get a bottle of local pÃ linka fruit brandy at the Magyar PÃ linka HÃ za instead While the best foodie gifts are found at the market hall for something pre packed just head to any supermarket Zsolnay is one of Budapest s many antique shops where you can browse unique collectibles Richard Nebesky Lonely Planet Antiques The antique shops and galleries lining leafy Falk Miksa utca in the V District beg to be explored You could spend hours here searching for that

Armani or the trendy stores lining VÃ ci utca and DeÃ k Ferenc utca But if youâ re looking to slip into something Hungarian head over to Nanushkaâ s flagship store for womenâ s fashion catering to urban nomads or turn to Vass Shoes a few corners down the road for quality menâ s footwear Vintage clothes are often found swinging on coathangers next to unique design pieces or tangled in a hidden basement youâ ll only discover by accident or through a savvy friend Get a new wardrobe or just have some fun dressing up like a pop star at downtown vintage stores such as Retrock Ludovika LoveBug
