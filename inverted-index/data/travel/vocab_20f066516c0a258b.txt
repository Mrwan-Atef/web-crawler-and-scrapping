tip If you re traveling outside of high season you wonâ t make it to Bol via direct catamaran as they only run from June to September But no worries you can take the regular ferry from Split to Supetar and then the bus across the island to Bol â just allow enough time on the way back as the bus sometimes gets stuck in traffic waiting for the ferry outside Supetar In the evening If you have

of walking the walls in Dubrovnik until the morning of your second day Benny Marty Shutterstock Day prepare to be wowed by Dubrovnikâ s old town Morning Catamarans run from KorÄ ula Town to Dubrovnik
