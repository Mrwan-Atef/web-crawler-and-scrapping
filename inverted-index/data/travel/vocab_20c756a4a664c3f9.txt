To Eat Eat Need To Know Know Palm Springs and the Desert Resorts TRAVEL GUIDE GALLERY Introduction Intro Hotels Stay Things To Do Do Where To Eat Eat Need To Know Know The Fodor s Five The five things you need to know before traveling to Palm Springs and the Desert Resorts Book a vehicle for valley wide exploration Located about two hours by car outside of the Los Angeles area Greater Palm Springs is a nine city desert oasis that stretches across the mile long Coachella Valley Rent a car if interested in bopping around to the various municipalities Palm Springs Desert Hot Springs Cathedral City Rancho Mirage Palm Desert Indian Wells La Quinta Indio Coachella or heading to nearby destinations like the Salton Sea Joshua Tree National Park or Idyllwild Research accommodations to suit every need There is no lack of accommodation types and price points across Greater Palm Springs ranging from chic itty bitty boutique hotels to larger than large resorts For the best stay decide what s important It might be a convenient location for sightseeing or a beautiful backdrop for Instagram There is also an overabundance of vacation rental properties which can be particularly attractive for group gatherings like family reunions bachelorette parties and corporate retreats Make reservations ahead of time or be flexible The communities that make up Greater Palm Springs are surprisingly small During the busier times to visit from October to April it can be difficult to secure spur of the moment restaurant reservations tours or taxis That s especially true when the valley plays host to massive events like the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January Modernism Week in February BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in March and Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April Depending on the season plan for extreme weather While the Coachella Valley boasts an average of days of sunshine temperatures can play a big factor in determining what s possible to do During spring and winter it can be cold at night The dry heat in the summer can often reach above degrees Fahrenheit meaning many outdoor activities are a no go However a trip from June to August is not out of the question There are still a plethora of cool pools and air conditioned activities like museums to enjoy Embrace the desert s slower pace From Indigenous communities soaking in ancient hot springs to heal or Hollywood celebrities jetting off to the desert to play Greater Palm Springs rich and unique history is steeped in escapism When visiting ignore any cases of FOMO that might pop up because there is so much to see do and taste Do not be afraid to spend an entire day relaxing at a spa or playing multiple rounds of golf If anything is missed it simply means another trip is in order for the future Read More Guidebooks for Every Journey Fodor s Best Weekend Road Trips Easy Planning Local Writers Itineraries Helpful Maps Buy Now See All Guideboks Fodor s Southern California with Los
