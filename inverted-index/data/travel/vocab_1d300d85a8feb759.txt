Although a church has stood here since the century this building dates from the turn of the century and has been altered several times most notably in when it was saved from ruin and some might say over enthusiastically restored The interior is as calm and soothing as the exterior is sombre The picturesque St Patrick s Park adjoining was a crowded slum until it was cleared in the early century

s throw from one another Separated only by the city walls with St Patrick s outside each possessed the rights of cathedral of the diocese While St Pat s isn t as photogenic as its neighbour it probably surpasses its more attractive rival in historical terms St Patrick s is a journey through medieval Dublin Getty Images Like Christ Church Cathedral the building has suffered a rather dramatic history of storm and fire damage and has been altered several times most questionably in when the flying buttresses were added thanks to the neo Gothic craze that swept the nation Oliver Cromwell

benevolent Guinness family stepped in to begin a massive restoration in Fun Fact chance your arm Towards the north transept is a door that has become a symbol of peace and reconciliation since it helped resolve a scrap between the Earls of Kildare and Ormond in After a feud supporters of the squabbling nobles ended up in a pitched battle inside the cathedral during which Ormond s nephew one Black James barricaded himself in the chapterhouse Kildare having calmed down cut a hole in the door between them and stuck his arm through it to either shake his opponent s hand or lose a limb in his attempt to smooth things over James chose mediation over amputation and took his hand The term to chance your arm entered the English lexicon and everyone lived happily ever after except Black James
