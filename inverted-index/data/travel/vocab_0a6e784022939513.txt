falls and hidden plunge pools transitioning between eucalypt plains and dense monsoon forests The three on trail campgrounds are bare bones bush toilets and fire pits only but their serenity offsets their simplicity In particular the pool strewn stretch connecting Tjenya Falls Campground and Southern Campground is astonishingly lush teeming with frogs lizards and rainforest birds Advertisement

beach and the Pacific s boundless horizon Keep an eye out for whales migrating north between late August and early September Pushing south the trail reveals more gems â Nina Bay s shady beach nook Little Ramsay Bay s creek fed lagoon and an infinity pool teetering above Zoe Falls The island s waterholes promise a reprieve from the sun but they can also attract mosquitoes sand flies and march

its mountainous realm Pack your hardiest boots for this one The track demands self sufficiency â no road access no luxuries just raw Tasmanian wilderness The trail s first climb onto an alpine plateau

delivers Mt Remarkable National Park s most iconic geological marvels On Ngadjuri and Nukunu land this trail network meanders through the mallee scrub rising above craggy escarpments that have formed over millennia The path appears deceptively simple But the track takes its time rippling between cleaved creekbeds and forested plateaus The park s most famous landmark Alligator Gorge carves through the bush with its sharp bends and fissured gullies conjuring a sinuous reptilian form rest assured no crocs lurk here Here summer s dry heat beats down with no cool waters for relief Instead the

every step is earned There are few markers no creature comforts and no formal campsites just raw remote terrain that demands thorough preparation route finding skills and river crossing experience
