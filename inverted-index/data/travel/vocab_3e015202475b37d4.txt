Texas s German Roots New Braunfels West San Antonio Street is the epicenter of historic New Braunfels Texas Photograph by Ian Dagnall Alamy Stock Photo TRAVEL INTELLIGENT TRAVEL Texas s German Roots New Braunfels By Robert Reid October min read Do you speak German I ask Un poquito Joyce is minding the register at the oldest bakery in Texas Naegelin s Opened in the establishment remains a landmark in downtown New Braunfels and a quirky reminder of the Lone Star State s German roots Around Joyce are bins brimming with traditional German goodies Lebkuchen cookies ornately embossed Springerle biscuits and sweet croissant like pretzels laced with pecans and drizzled with icing Texas pecans she adds as a point of clarification I buy one It s hard to imagine a better place to spend a spare day in central Texas New Braunfels was founded partway between San Antonio and Austin in by a German prince looking to start a colony in what was at that time the Republic of Texas Despite the fact that New Germany never came to fruition New Braunfels persevered and today represents one of the most historic German American communities in the United States And though German surnames top many of the town s century buildings use of the language seems limited to the odd word on local storefronts usually Willkommen and eatery menus These days the place might be best known for its marginally German waterpark Schlitterbahn After checking in at the Prince Solms Inn I take a late morning stroll before the heat really ratchets up I breeze through a train depot museum peek into a violin shop and pass Henne Hardware whose windows provide a showcase for old fashioned cast iron stoves oversize stuffed animals and semi automatic BB hand guns Around the corner is the Phoenix Saloon where an enterprising German and proprietor of what was then called the Back Room Cafe named William Gebhardt gave the world chili powder by inventing a machine to crush and dry fresh peppers That was in Texas has had a long love affair with chili they even have their own variety I ve never had it Inside the Phoenix a family sits by the bar where beers are on tap eating burgers as a Motorhead song plays The menu announces that they serve chili I notice beans cost extra Yeah beans the bartender explains kindly are sort of a northern thing I go bean free and the stuff is so spicy I have to alternate between the chili and bites from an oversize slice of cornbread Upon seeing my reaction the bartender offers to bring me a side of sour cream That usually cuts the spice she says Afterward I drive a few blocks to the Sophienburg Museum I pause at a rendering of Prince Carl the town s founder who s donning a bright tunic a richly plumed Three Musketeer s worthy hat strapping thigh high boots and a belted sword It s an interesting look admits Kiwa a museum staffer with red chopsticks holding up her black hair We don t wear leggings like that I guarantee you In the course of poking around the museum I bump into one other visitor David Burck a transplant from the Midwest who picked out this German sounding town by looking at a map Thank goodness for Google He s now publisher of the New Braunfels Herald Zeitung which is as one exhibit informs me the oldest continuously operating newspaper in Texas Everyone is so involved here he tells me by way of explaining his community of roughly They also tube like demons All day I ve watched buses pulling trailers filled with massive inner tubes pass me on the street It s so dang hot in New Braunfels that its two clean clear cool rivers seem a minor miracle The Comal River a tributary of the Guadalupe weaves through downtown I pay an outfitter for a tube to use and a shuttle ride back after a two hour ride I scamper barefoot across hot parking lot asphalt jump into the water and begin my slow journey I can see rocks on the river bottom below Picnickers stand waist deep in the water sipping Bud Light at riverbank parks I notice a few fellow tubers I pass have lashed coolers to their rigs for drink and drift convenience Near a sign that reads No Jumping a something guy with long hair make a flying leap in After an hour I reach a winding concrete channel known as a tube chute In a quick unexpected rush I m dumped backward into a torrent of white water below Tubing is fun And tiring somehow After a late afternoon nap I head out for Gruene pronounced green a neighboring town that s slowly being absorbed into New Braunfels Tonight s the kick off for Geezerfest and hundreds of cars fill a grass lot I park near a shady grove where adults sip Texan wine as a bluegrass band plays in a gazebo then move on to admire Gruene Hall Texas s oldest dance hall National Geographic Expeditions Travel with National Geographic Search Trips At Oma Gruene s Secret Garten a deeply bearded band plays zydeco songs with a year old washboard player chiming in I sit at a communal picnic table with a bratwurst and a can of local beer And when my packet of yellow mustard spurts onto my cell phone a tipsy middle aged woman clutching a Dos Equis hands me a wadded napkin I saw that she says That mustard does not open She often comes here for beer and music walking from her home a quarter mile away A stocky guy sporting a chin ponytail a piano key tie and a bright orange shirt walks by and directs a nod her way That guy s a fixture here she says when he leaves He does this sort of interpretive dance He never touches you It s all kind of platonic She doesn t know his name The sun is down now and Geezerfest s overlapping music fills the still steamy air I move to another spot and listen to a country singer on a scratched up acoustic sip from a bottle of Shiner Bock and watch guys throw horseshoes in a back lot lit by a string of Christmas lights It s easy to imagine spending another hours here Or longer Celebrated travel personality Robert Reid is a featured digital reporter for Nat Geo Travel Follow his adventures
