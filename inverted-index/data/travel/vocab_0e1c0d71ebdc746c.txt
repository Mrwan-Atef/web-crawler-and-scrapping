Matt Phillips Nov min read Share Here s how to experience the best of Kenya s vibrant culture and incredible wildlife Â Ayzenstayn Getty Images Despite having a coastline of beautiful beaches perfect for lazing on visitors to Kenya rarely sit still â the country simply has too many exciting things to do Stirring landscapes ranging from equatorial glaciers and jagged peaks to wildlife laden plains and tropical reefs provide an epic natural playground for all who venture here while the intoxicating mix of cultures surprises at every turn Here are ten experiences you can t miss in Kenya See the Big Five on safari Not only were safaris born in Kenya but so was the very word itself â it means journey in Swahili Spotting the much heralded Big Five lion leopard buffalo rhino and elephant is a major aspiration of many visitors to Africa and Kenya provides some of the continentâ s most impressive natural settings for the search No natural reserve is more famous than the Masai Mara where sightings of all these species are common Lake Nakuru National Park with its flamingo lined lake and forest clad escarpments is another incredible place for Big Five safaris as is Amboseli National Park where Mt Kilimanjaro provides a staggering backdrop Advertisement Samburu Game Reserve in the remote north is prime safari territory and as well as being a great place to spot a leopard it also hosts its own Samburu Special Five Beisa oryx Grevyâ s zebra long necked gerenuk reticulated giraffe and Somali ostrich Planning tip If youâ re in Nairobi donâ t overlook Nairobi National Park on the outskirts of the capital Often billed as the only national park within a city in the world Kenyaâ s first game reserve has wildlife in abundance from lions leopards and buffalo to the endangered black rhino and around species of birdlife Head out on a hike Mt Kenya â s trekking terrain is arguably the African continentâ s most beautiful and rewarding Its diverse valleys equatorial glaciers and dramatic towering summit are extraordinary best seen over a challenging multi day hike to Point Lenana the mountainâ s third highest peak and the highest reachable without climbing equipment The more gentle slopes of Mt Elgon technically in Uganda but on the border with Kenya and often visited from Kenya are home to elephants primates antelopes and some species of birds Itâ s another great option for treks lasting several days as are captivating walks with the Maasai through their homelands Incredible day hikes are also possible throughout Kenya â climb up Mt Longonot to its crater rim seek out remote waterfalls in the mountains of Aberdare National Park or take a leisurely stroll in the dense Kakamega Forest while listening to birdsong If youâ re craving greenery in Nairobi Karura Forest is the capitalâ s oasis with around miles of trails set around a waterfall caves rivers and wetland Head out of one of Kenya s historic ports on a traditional sailing ship John Seaton Callahan Getty Images Sail on a dhow Kenyaâ s Indian Ocean coast is beautiful no matter how you see it but the most romantic way to experience the water is from the deck of a traditional dhow These wooden sailing vessels have been used along this stretch of coastline for centuries and they are still entrenched in Swahili culture today Whether launching from the historical island of Lamu home to Kenyaâ s oldest continually inhabited town from the shores of Mombasa or the modern resort village of Diani Beach these wind powered voyages slip past stunning slivers of sand remote coral islands and reefs teeming with fish Planning tip In Mombasa try the well known Tamarind Dhow experience Witness the Great Migration Itâ s been called the greatest natural spectacle on the planet and with good reason Each year from July to October as many as million wildebeest and hundreds of thousands of zebras and gazelles make a dramatic crossing of the crocodile infested Mara River to feed on the lush grasses of the Masai Mara Advertisement The flood of animals filling the open savanna includes herds of elephants and giraffes and trailing this sea of prey are lions leopards cheetahs and hyenas Needless to say there is never a shortage of drama during the Great Migration Follow the tracks of Hell s Gate on a cycling safari Â Getty Images Go mountain biking Mountain biking in Kenya is not your average mountain biking â here this two wheeled pursuit offers a unique means of embracing both the countryâ s incredible landscapes and its iconic wildlife Ride over the red earth paths in the volcanic confines of Hellâ s Gate National Park cycling past grazing buffaloes giraffes impalas and zebras or take to the grasslands of the Masai Mara for a guided cycle safari like no other Planning tip For the purest mountain bikers who want nothing more than to test their skills there are some great single track routes of varying gradient and difficulty on Mt Kenya and within the Rift Valley above Naivasha For those wanting a more leisurely cycle exploring the coastal areas around Diani Beach Malindi and Watamu by bike is an engaging option Dive or snorkel Kenyaâ s coast With much of the coast sheltered by reefs Kenyaâ s calm inshore waters â speckled with shoals of vibrantly colored fish â provide some of the easiest and most transfixing snorkeling in East Africa Simply float above the seabed and take it all in or strap on a tank and take a deeper dip on the other side of the reef where whale sharks dolphins and swordfish play Excellent sites include Watamu Marine National Park and Reserve a haven for the green turtle Galu Reef for sightings of seahorses scorpion fish and ghostfish and Nyuliâ s steep coral reef wall Planning tip For those wanting to up their diving skills highly regarded operations offer open water diving courses Kenya is also a great place for beginners to take to the water You ll find schools in Diani Beach Watamu and Wasini Island that teach PADI Professional Association of Diving Instructors courses which start in shore based pools beneath swaying palms Meeting local people is one of the most memorable experiences on a trip to Kenya Bartosz Hadyniak Getty Images Meet Kenya s diversity of people Although it is dreams of Kenyaâ s wondrous wildlife that draws most people to this East African nation many peopleâ s lasting memories revolve around their interactions with Kenyans themselves Meetings with the Maasai people with their traditional red shukas and charismatic culture add depth and warmth to any trip into the Mara region The same can be said for the striking Turkana people in Loiyangalani along the eastern shore of the Jade Sea Lake Turkana Visitors to the annual Marsabit Lake Turkana Festival will also meet many of the other communities from Kenyaâ s remote north such as the El Molo Rendille Samburu Dassanach Gabra Borana Konso Sakuye Garre Waata Burji and Somali The diversity of cultures in Kenya is truly astounding Due to its history as a former British colony Kenya has a sizable South Asian population of Hindus Muslims Goans and Sikhs and a smaller yet influential white European community as part of that legacy While the Swahili people on the coast from Mombasa to Malindi differ in that they donâ t share a common heritage they are bound by a language and an African history that is tied to Arabia and Persia There is no better place to immerse yourself in this world than in the labyrinth of crooked alleyways in Lamu town and Shela village on Lamu Island Planning tip Time your visit to Kenya to coincide with one of its many vibrant cultural festivals Ride a wave or the wind Want a burst of adrenaline with your taste of the Indian Ocean The same winds that power the elegant dhows fuel two great water sports windsurfing and kitesurfing The latter has really caught on in Kenya with many schools providing lessons for beginners as well as equipment rentals for experienced kitesurfers Diani Beach and neighboring Galu Beach are the epicenters of action while Nyali and less crowded Shanzu beaches close to Mombasa town are also highly recommended The waters off Watamu and Malindi are excellent for experienced surfers because the waves are bigger and thereâ s no reef The fun doesnâ t stop inland however with whitewater rafting trips possible on both the Tana also known as the Sagana and Athi rivers which thunder down from the Central Highlands at certain points during the year Float over Kenya in a hot air balloon Perhaps the most intoxicating safari experience in Kenya is to slowly climb â one exciting flame blast at a time â above the famous rolling savanna and flat topped acacia trees of the Masai Mara in a hot air balloon Floating silently over streams of wildebeest on their Great Migration lions stalking their prey or a lone black rhino moving through the bush is a perspective that nobody can ever forget When the light is just right itâ s possible to marvel at the perfectly proportioned elephant shaped shadows cast by the largest member of the Big Five Few experiences in life are as peaceful as they are exciting and a hot air balloon safari in Kenya is certainly one of them Join a camel safari Camel safaris are a wonderful way of mixing wildlife culture landscapes and adventure by getting into remote areas where few others and often no vehicles go Most operate in the northern tribal areas of the Samburu and Turkana which means visitors will also witness nomadic life and mingle with local people Wildlife is not as prolific as in the southern parks but on these trips it does not matter â the journey is the main attraction Mornings are spent on the move with visitors either riding the camels or walking alongside them whichever they prefer After striking camp around noon participants have the rest of the day to enjoy guided walks and cultural interactions or to just relax Experienced Samburu moran warriors usually lead the caravans with English speaking tribal guides on hand to dispense interesting details on local folklore botany ornithology and local customs Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow
