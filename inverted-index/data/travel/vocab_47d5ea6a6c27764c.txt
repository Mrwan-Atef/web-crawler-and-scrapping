iconic mountain of Esja across the bay from the pocket sized capital of ReykjavÃ k Â Getty Images You may have seen pictures of ReykjavÃ kâ s brightly colored houses tiered along the shore the vibrant cafes and bars in Reykjavik the centre of the city or drone footage of fireworks over the ziggurat of HallgrÃ mskirkja slicing the skyline Icelandâ s capital promises all of this and more ReykjavÃ k is full of life year round Around of the countryâ s population lives in the capital region making the most of their long winters with superb arts and crafts an excellent live music scene and world class restaurants paired with humble hot dog stands And letâ s not forget the toasty hot springs perfect for soaking and taking the chill out of your bones after a long walk Combine your city break with a day trip or more to explore the volcanoes waterfalls and glaciers that radiate out across this splendid welcoming island When should I go to ReykjavÃ k The streets of ReykjavÃ k fill right up from June to August when visitors flock to Iceland for its warm ish summer season long days and the access the season brings to the countryside Some of the most extreme mountain roads called F roads in Iceland only open from mid to late June and close by the end of August when the ice and snow starts to accumulate again The downside Prices are at their highest and you need to have booked at least six months in advance for good accommodation and the best deals on car hire and the most coveted tours Advertisement Spring and autumn are a chance to visit when the crowds are fewer so these big open spaces seem more your own and you share the streets of the capital more with Reykjavikers The weather is variable â but really it can be all year round â so pack accordingly but prices are softer and availability more kind Also you can still access much of the country Winter is the province of darkness and austere adventure Full daylight hours are miniscule â just or hours â but the atmospheric sunrises and sunsets make for great viewing and itâ s the chance to see the Northern Lights too Many country hotels and restaurants close or reduce services especially over the December holidays but ReykjavÃ k itself remains open for all comers Prices are at their most affordable ReykjavÃ k s famously photogenic houses brighten the mood no matter the season Â Martin Shutterstock How much time should I spend in ReykjavÃ k Well Iâ d say forever But if you have to limit your trip you could soak up a lot of the ReykjavÃ k vibe and hit its top sights in a matter of two or three days Youâ d get to have leisurely coffees and kleinur bow shaped donuts or Ã starpungar love ball donut spheres with raisins shop design boutiques visit art museums and galleries plus get all the selfies â from churchside to the Sun Voyager statue and Old Harbour Then Iâ d surely suggest another two days minimum to get out into the countryside or go on a whale watching trip and other excursions The activities are gobsmacking â from ice climbing glacier walking and snowmobiling to hiking or puffin viewing in the back of a farm tractor or simply strolling behind the shimmering sheet of a coursing waterfall Winter has its Northern Lights chasing get help at with the aurora forecast and ice caves firm up at glacier edges they are unstable the rest of the year With a very short drive youâ ll reach iconic places like the original parliament site in the rift valley of Ã ingvellir National Park or the active fissure volcanoes around the Reykjanes Peninsula when theyâ re safe to observe and the lagoons hot springs and pools You could easily spend weeks in the countryside But thatâ s another article two or three Is it easy to get to and around ReykjavÃ k ReykjavÃ k is the primary international gateway to Iceland so its KeflavÃ k International Airport KEF about southwest of ReykjavÃ k always seems to be expanding There are also a few flights from Greenland and the Faroe Islands which arrive at ReykjavÃ k Domestic Airport Icelandic transport is generally efficient and accessible Unless you are jumping in a hire car to tour outside of ReykjavÃ k immediately then Flybus and Airport Direct run regularly to the city centre and are cheaper than taxis or take public bus for The centre is enjoyably walkable with tidy straight streets and lots to look at all in a compact area surrounding Lake TjÃ rnin The bus network StrÃ with its handy app KlappiÃ works very well for the further reaches of the city A car is really unnecessary if you are staying in the capital unless you have mobility issues Advertisement For getting out into the countryside and road tripping you can either hire a car or camper or join one of the many many tours and excursions that include pickup in ReykjavÃ k Public bus routes beyond the capital are targeted to Icelandic villages and towns and services in some areas are reduced or cut altogether in winter The stunning Hallgrimskirkja cathedral is a major landmark by which to orientate yourself Â TTstudio Shutterstock Top things to do in ReykjavÃ k Part of the real fun of ReykjavÃ k is to walk around and explore Since itâ s got such a compact city centre grabbing a coffee Icelanders love their coffee and baked goodie try Sandholt or BrauÃ Co and window shopping on pedestrianized Laugavegur and rÃ ustÃ gur easily lead to a visit to HallgrÃ mskirkja or the several branches of the ReykjavÃ k Art Museum and the nearby Photography Museum You can also stroll through the Old Reykjavik district for a history hit checking out the earliest buildings including a Viking longhouse at AÃ alstrÃ ti Settlement Exhibition Then continue south along lake TjÃ rnin to the National Museum I also love a walk around the Old Harbour with Harpa concert hall glittering in the distance â definitely stopping for a meal at one of the many great seafood spots from high end delish Matur og Drykkur to casual comfort food in the Grandi MathÃ ll food hall and craft beer at the Bryggjan BrugghÃºs or Lady Brewery In fact the area around Grandi is also a loaded with entertainments â from whale and puffin spotting boat excursions to many kid friendly places like the Saga Museum Whales of Iceland and the Omnom chocolate factory Oh and donâ t miss hearing live local music while youâ re in town Reykjavikers know how to put on a good show You can warm up at Kaffibarinn or with a visit to a few of the excellent brew pubs in the centre â like Kaldi Micro Bar and SkÃºli From bathing in hot pools to sea swimming ReykjavÃ k is a great city for outdoors activities Â Shutterstock My favorite thing to do in ReykjavÃ k No matter the time of year I love love love soaking in Icelandic waters Every town in Iceland has a pool and geothermal hot spring or several and in the capital I love the cool vintage pool with multiple hot pots cold plunge sauna and steam room at central SundhÃ llin little fact it was designed in the by the same architect who did HallgrÃ mskirkja You can also head out to the windswept Seltjarnarnes neighbourhood for a walk around the lighthouse then a soak at its pool To the east of the centre the awesome Laugardalur pool complex has twisting water slides and abuts the botanic garden more art and a sculpture museum and is near the jumping off point to remote feeling ViÃ ey Island Etiquette tip shower before getting into a pool or hot spring It is an absolute all over Iceland that if you are going to swim or soak you must shower using soap without your swimsuit on and wash your hair in the provided changing shower room Itâ s basic Icelandic hygiene and allows the pools to have minimal or no chlorine or chemicals added The nightlife and live music scene in ReykjavÃ k is top draw year round Â Matteo Provendola Shutterstock How much money do I need for ReykjavÃ k Iceland ainâ t cheap And ReykjavÃ k is among the most expensive places in the country especially for lodging boutique double room You can help yourself out by booking well ahead to get the best deals guesthouse double room with shared bathroom Or visit outside of high season summer Bars beer and restaurants are pricey as well â with a warm soup and homemade bread costing what a full meal might cost in southern European countries I usually combine some eating out whether a hot dog cafe meal or a main dish in a top restaurant with a fair dose of self catering I often rent a small studio apartment While groceries are not cheap they at least make it easier to save a few krona Another budgeting trick Buy alcohol in the airport arrivals hallâ s duty free shop as you come into the country for big savings The fact is the cost is well worth it Iceland is such a special country that no matter how many days you can afford a visit will pay you back in lifetime memory dividends Plus quality is generally high Your splurge of a trip should get you clean well run accommodations and delicious homemade food You can also economize by staying in a hostel dorm bed camping or if youâ re heading to the countryside hiring a camper van where you can stay in the marked campgrounds most towns offer Bring layers or pick up a traditional Icelandic wool jumper for Reykjavik Â Annapurna Mellor Getty Images Bring lots of layers no matter the season What you can predict about weather in ReykjavÃ k is that it is unpredictable A sunny warm F C day can easily turn to storm and cloud what with the islandâ s location in the middle of the Atlantic Always pack layers and always bring them with you when you head out on a hike Ideally youâ ll have a thick warm wool or synthetic that dries well underlayer and a waterproof outerlayer Do I need to know Icelandic Most Icelanders speak impeccable English making travel for anyone who can make do in English rather easy Some of the older generations do not however and in general learning a few expressions like takk fyrir thank you is simply polite and more fun How can I be a responsible traveller in and around ReykjavÃ k Icelandâ s online resources are superb and they have a network of sites and apps to help plan for safe travel if you leave the capital at all Some top sites to check out are Visit Iceland and Visit ReykjavÃ k for inspiration and information Sjalfsbjorg is provides short term mobility equipment rental and curated lists of accessible hotels restaurants and transport options ReykjavÃ k Grapevine is a great English language newspaper and website with current cultural listings Entertaining and informative Iceland podcasts to get you in the mood include All Things Iceland and Stories of Iceland Despite the summer festival vibe in the capital always be respectful of its residentsâ needs â though it can get busy itâ s still peopleâ s home and overtourism and jacked up apartment prices are a real concern When a few Icelanders ate whale shark or puffin it could be sustainable but when million tourists do not so much If you leave the capital stay on marked roads and protect the truly unspoilt nature you donâ t want to be the one to spoil it Only use designated areas for camping and actual toilets for your pit stops Check weather and road conditions before heading out If you re going hiking register at Safe Travel and learn about staying safe Theyâ ve all got apps too Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local
