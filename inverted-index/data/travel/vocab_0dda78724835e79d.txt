Aug min read Share For some dreams of post pandemic travel remain distant Â Studio MUTI Kenyan writer Carey Baraka was ready to set off on the first adventure in what he hoped would be decades of wandering Then the pandemic hit â and laid bare the challenges of traveling in Africa as an African I wonder what versions of ourselves have been lost in this period of being mostly unable to travel A life ambition of mine has been to stop living anywhere to stop paying rent owning furniture paying for utilities to remove the normal maintenance work of habitation from my daily life Instead I d be an itinerant traveler constantly on the road spending nights in shifty hotels in different countries becoming a super user on the Couchsurfing app learning how to say â helloâ and did you catch the game last night in multiple languages As a child I wanted to be a contestant on the TV show The Amazing Race hiking through a trail in Brazil or running down a side street in Spain all in search of clues In college a friend and I taught ourselves how to say â I canâ t speak this language but I can speak Englishâ in French Spanish and Portuguese just in case This was a life I told myself Iâ d start living after university In this peripatetic version of myself I imagined I d be happier Advertisement I graduated in but instead of jumping into a life of travel I underwent a prolonged emotional crisis Brought down by a series of minor tragedies in my personal lifeâ each almost harmless in itself but terrible in their sumâ I fled Nairobi where Iâ d moved for college retreating to my grandparentsâ home in the western part of Kenya There my phone mostly off or unavailable I extracted myself I ate I read I wrote I read some more I watched a lot of rom coms I listened to a lot of Phil Collins I attempted to rebalance myself As the pandemic spread talking about travel became the only way to tap into wanderlust Â Studio MUTI A trip imagined In the midst of all this my friend Stacy and I were talking she being one of a few friends I was still in communication with Stacy and I have known each other since we were kids but it is only in recent years that we have discovered in each other a shared affinity for travel and a common desire to live a life on the move We traded dreams until they became itineraries Eventually we decided we were going to go on a multi country road trip from Kenya into Tanzania to the city of Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika and across Zambia to Victoria Falls Over several phone calls we discussed dates came up with a budget and plotted a route We started to save money and I renewed my passport We decided April would be our month of travel Over those months I felt the rush that comes from planning a trip Weâ d cross the border from Kenya and stop in Arusha a town in Northern Tanzania thatâ s considered the safari capital of the world due to its proximity to Mt Kilimanjaro Mt Meru and Serengeti National Park We didnâ t know how long weâ d spend there Spontaneity was the credo From Arusha Kigoma is a thousand kilometers to the west Itâ s located on the shores of Lake Tanganyika near Tanzaniaâ s borders with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi Our plan was to take seven days to get there while stopping at the small towns along the way Maybe weâ d stop at Mbulu Maybe Shinyanga Maybe Tabora Maybe another town we didnâ t even know about The goal was to be itinerant drifters discovering ourselves as we moved through the region As long as we didnâ t go broke it didnâ t matter how long weâ d take to get to Kigoma We were going to Kigoma because of a ship Iâ d read about which though more than a century old still plies across Lake Tanganyika each week taking travelers to Zambia Over three days the red hulled ship floats across the second deepest freshwater lake in the world I was intrigued as much by the journey as the history Advertisement I knew the basics The ship MV Liemba was part of the German naval fleet during World War I having been floated for the first time on February but it was scuttled a year later during the German retreat from Kigoma and returned to service by the British in Weâ d take that very same ship across Lake Tanganyika to its southern tip disembarking in Mpulungu Zambia This was to be the first time I was on a ship I was excited curious about sea sickness and already nervous about how deep the water was We figured it would take about a week to cross the country and reach the Zimbabwean border Along the way as we did in Tanzania weâ d discover the pleasures of nameless faceless towns Then weâ d get to Victoria Falls â Mosi oa Tunya â or â The smoke that thunders â We imagined letting the spray wash over our faces basking in the glory of the waters We also imagined weâ d be broke two weeks into our trip so the falls would be our last stop Instead of crossing the border into Zimbabwe weâ d have to return to Tanzania which weâ d do using the old Tazara railway lineâ the Chinese funded kilometer railway which at its completion in was the longest in Africaâ and head to Dar es Salaam Weâ d spend a few days in Dar lying on a beach the last of our money spent on some cold drinks speaking Kenyan Swahili to locals before going back to Kenya While some parts of the world inch back to normalcy others are still in the grip of the pandemic Â Studio MUTI A trip deferred I counted down the days until April This was what I needed to recover the first multi country trip for either of us But then of course we never left home Instead a pandemic swept across the globe In March Kenya announced its first case and borders were closed The government announced a raft of restrictions and a curfew that was still in place more than a year later Here we still are all this time later trapped A few months into the pandemic dreams of my journey with Stacy starting to fade I met a photographer friend in his Ethiopian restaurant in Nairobi It was almost dusk just a few minutes until the curfew set in and the mosquitoes had started their evening buzzing We were talking about travel and I told him about the time I visited Lake Turkana also known as the Jade Sea in Northern Kenya Turkana the largest desert lake in the world crosses the border with Ethiopia I described how beautiful the water was how it taught me what the color jade really meant He told me about a road trip he had taken with his friends They were passing through Mozambique on their way to South Africa when everything went wrong They found themselves in an unfamiliar place hearing an unfamiliar language nervous about their safety waiting for a bus that might never come I was fascinated and hung on to every new twist in the story I quickly realized the word for what I was feeling was envy Envy is not an uncommon feeling for us future travelers Sometimes itâ s money we envy the ability to jet off to another part of the world without having to scrimp and save for months Sometimes itâ s passports we envy and wonder at the true spontaneity that can come from visa on arrival status A trip just a vaccine away Travel has always been unequal Before the pandemic we could rely on among other things visa politics and racism to hold certain hegemonies in place Now however in the wake of such prolonged stillness Covid has prompted new questions about these inequalities and what responsible travel looks like One of the manifestations of this inequality is the fact that people from several Western countries have throughout the course of the pandemic been going on vacations in the Global South while the reverse is much more difficult to do Fleeing a ban on partying in their native Germany an enclave of DJs threw weekly parties in Tanzaniaâ s premier coastal tourist spots with Zanzibar a particularly popular destination for Western travelers seeking to escape Covid restrictions in their countries Further north the Kenyan island town of Lamu a UNESCO World Heritage site has been transformed into Notting Hill as wealthy Britons seek to rediscover themselves in Africa Here you can be as one article gloated â maskless and topless â and live your best life There are conversations being had in several Western countries about Covid passports The logic is sound after all one does need certain vaccines in order to travel to some countries However Covid vaccines are barely available in the Global South While for instance the United States has vaccinated more than half of its citizens only of people living in Africa have been vaccinated If a Covid passport is a requirement for travel then movement becomes a two tier system with the Global North up top while the rest of us unfortunately occupy the lower rung On Twitter Iâ ve been seeing people joyous at the prospect of summer and all the partying theyâ ll do to make up for the past year The Euros have just finished and there were thousands of supporters in the stands the beneficiaries of vaccine programs None of this is my reality Instead Iâ ve spent the past week in an even more intense isolation than before A few days ago Stacy texted about a new trip we had been planning a trip within Kenya this time I told her that I was sick and wasnâ t able to travel yet I didnâ t tell her that it was Covid You may also like A new electric safari car will aid conservation efforts in Kenya
