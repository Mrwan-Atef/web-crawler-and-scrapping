Innes May min read Share Find out how to blend in like a local in Germany with this guide to what you need to know before you go Â PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek Shutterstock With the worldâ s third largest economy a history thatâ ll take you a lifetime to unpack and a population of more than million people almost one fifth of whom have an immigrant background it is almost impossible to form any generalisations about a singular Germany Instead expect a country full of bewildering contradictions quirky social norms and in the capital especially stereotypes turned on their head Advertisement Germans love cycling to get around and bike sharing schemes are common Â Shutterstock Get around on two wheels Bike riding is a beloved mode of transportation in Germany and there are many dedicated bike lanes in cities and along popular cycling routes in regional areas Bike sharing schemes are common and in some cities you might even find shared cargo bikes â a popular way to get around with children in tow Always err on the side of caution and lock your bike whenever you leave it unattended Motorists are generally aware and cautious of cyclists though you should always remain alert and many people in urban areas wear a helmet even if it is not required by law Things are set to get even better for two wheeled commuters with the implementation of the federal governmentâ s National Cycling Plan which aims to double the number of cyclists in Germany by Cycling infrastructure will be improved extended and made safer â and it will help to cut carbon emissions Book train tickets in advance â and always reserve a seat Traveling around Germany is relatively quick and easy if you take the high speed ICE trains run by the Deutsche Bahn Tickets can be expensive especially for last minute travel and over major holidays but the trains are comfortable and generally arrive on time Itâ s almost always worth paying extra to reserve a seat otherwise you could find yourself sitting on the floor in the bike storage carriage for the duration of your journey That or drinking a beer in the onboard restaurant If youâ re traveling with kids try to reserve seats in the Familienbereich family area to save yourself sideways stares for if â or when â your kids go wild or lose their cool The Kleinkindbereich is a closed compartment suitable for those traveling with babies and toddlers â it even has a carpeted space to crawl around Traveling Germany by public transport Save this article for key tips including booking free train travel for kids Advertisement Sundays are for relaxing at the park walking in green spaces or trawling flea markets Â hanohiki Shutterstock Forget about shopping on a Sunday Shopping is generally a no no on Sundays when supermarkets and retail outlets are closed in accordance with the law If youâ re in desperate need of something your best bet is to head to a major train or bus station where there might be a supermarket and Apotheke pharmacy open Otherwise almost everything else runs as usual â museums tourist attractions bakeries cafes etc â including SpÃ tis small convenience stores but with limited opening hours Locals instead spend their Sundays indulging in simple pleasures like hanging out in the park hiking trawling flea markets and going out for coffee and cake In Berlin itâ s also a popular day to go clubbing Always carry cash in Germany It remains surprisingly true Germans prefer cash â even in the countryâ s capital â and it will make things infinitely easier if you carry some on you at all times â including coins for public toilets which are rarely free Many smaller cafes bakeries and bars donâ t accept card payments at all but this is generally clearly stated at the door â or communicated once youâ ve pulled out your card phone to pay Things are changing however and you will find card or other cashless payment methods available in far more places than you might have just a year or two ago In fact there are now some places that donâ t take cash at all Be prepared for both It s not a cheap destination but it is possible to travel in Germany on a budget Can I speak English in Germany German is the official language and it is spoken by the vast majority of the population English is the next most common language and it is widely spoken especially in cities such as Berlin Munich and Frankfurt though less so in regional areas That said you may receive looks of bewilderment if you enter a shop or cafe and address staff in English without first attempting a few words in German Itâ s definitely worth practising at least a few words and simple phrases to make your trip a little easier â Danke thank you Bitte please Entschuldigung excuse me and goodbye are a good start But the German language can be unforgiving to beginners and many German speakers will switch immediately to English at even a hint of a foreign accent Easy German has some excellent YouTube tutorials as well as insightful videos about life in Berlin and Germany Drinking in public is not forbidden but public drunkenness is not cool Â Barry Pack EyeEm Getty Images It is okay to consume alcohol in public but not to get drunk Drinking in public spaces in Germany is nicht verboten not forbidden Thereâ s nothing to stop you from buying a beer from the SpÃ ti to drink while sitting on the street or in a public space such as a park This is fairly common socially acceptable behavior especially at the end of the day and thereâ s no need to hide your bottle in a paper bag Public drunkenness on the other hand and even public loudness will quickly mark you as an outsider Go easy and if youâ re drinking beer check the alcohol content before swilling away â it might be higher than what youâ re used to and drinking bottles the norm can catch up with you When youâ ve finished your beer or almost any other bottled drink never put the empty bottle in the bin or recycling â leave it instead in a discrete spot such as next to a bin and someone will eventually come along and collect it for the Pfand deposit refund Although not outwardly overly friendly Germans are generally kind and helpful Â TommL Getty Images Are people friendly in Germany Small talk pleasantries and welcoming smiles arenâ t the most typical German way and customer service can leave those used to more easy going chatty interactions feeling rather cold On top of that many German locals wonâ t think twice about firmly redirecting you sometimes harshly so â say if you walk in the cycle lane which can sometimes be difficult to differentiate from the footpath ride your bike on a footpath walk against a red Ampelmann pedestrian light or take too long packing your groceries at the supermarket yes really Berliners in particular are renowned for their lack of social niceties epitomized by the Berliner Schnauze the gruff attitude adopted by some locals It sounds tiresome but if you ignore any perceived hostilities and carry on with your business you are likely to find that the majority of German locals are kind and helpful â if not always outwardly friendly Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us
