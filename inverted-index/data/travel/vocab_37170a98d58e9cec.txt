music festivals take place within its once formidable walls Lukiškės Prison offers a journey into the unexpected a testament to the resilience of a place and the people determined to repurpose it

Chief Jim Hopper is held captive From Imperial cells to Soviet stronghold Before its Netflix cameo the story of Lukiškės Prison began during the rule of the Russian Empire Tsarist authorities constructed the prison to quell resistance in Vilnius known for its cultural and political diversity It was a crossroads of political empires for centuries and it grew to become a place where Lithuanians Poles Belarusians Russians and Jews coexisted within its borders A safe haven for a melting pot of ethnicities languages religions and political ideologies Lithuania ultimately rebelled against Russian rule During the early century Lukiškės Prison became a bleak home to political dissidents and criminals alike cementing its reputation as a place of dread Torture rape and murder occurred in this prison that housed both men and women Their screams could be heard not only by other prisoners as a warning but to Lithuanians walking nearby The penitentiary offered no privacy or care but prisoners were allowed to shower once a week Possibly taken between and this photo may have been the first to capture Lukiškės Prison after it was built in the early century It shows two

Union took over in Lukiškės was already notorious Under Stalin s rule it became even more crowded as thousands of Lithuanians nationalists intellectuals and those who refused to conform to Soviet

security prison until its closure in when Lithuania was well into its independence from the Soviet Union and the prison was seen as a relic of an era best left behind According to tour guides its

historical significance and unique structure Martynas Butkevičius and Povilas Oželis won a public tender lease of the prison and reopened it as Lukiškės Prison It was an opportunity to breathe new life into its empty halls The idea was radical yet simple Turn the prison once a symbol of oppression into a space for creativity and self expression This approach echoed the country s desire to remember its past while embracing a future rooted in innovation and cultural exploration Lithuanians are happy about the transformation Not only is it unlike anything else for tourists to experience
