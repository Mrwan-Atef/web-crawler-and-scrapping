Uncovering St Lucia s natural wonders from volcanic spas to storied mountain trails The view across Soufrière and the two Piton mountains Photograph by AWL Images TRAVEL Uncovering St Lucia s natural wonders from volcanic spas to storied mountain trails To the uninitiated St Lucia is as tranquil as it appears on postcards But taking its cue from the volcanic forces that formed it the island nation serves up plenty of high drama from oozing mud baths to storied sailboat trips and mountain trails By Adrian Phillips April min read This article was adapted from National Geographic Traveller UK Have you ever heard a frog s whistle It s made up of two notes the second slightly longer and higher than the first I d describe it as a chirpy ger leep And when thousands upon thousands of whistling frogs start ger leeping from damp hiding places in the early evening making great bubblegum blows with their throat pouches in a chorus that seems to swell by the minute they sound like a mass rally of penny whistle players It s fabulous And now the sun has set the weather is ratcheting up the atmosphere further Rain drums mercilessly on the iron clad roof and dashes itself into a fine mist on the wooden railings of the veranda Lightning jags across the night sky and in that neon lit fraction of a second I see rain draping a grey shawl over the bay and across the silhouette of the mountains Then darkness rushes back and thunder rolls like the deep long growl of some celestial guard dog behind the sky deeper and longer than any thunder I ve ever heard before It s particularly fabulous because my room high on a ridge at the Ladera Resort has no windows Or indeed a front wall This is open concept accommodation the sleeping area running seamlessly into the veranda and out to the natural world beyond There are plenty of luxuries bespoke furniture has been carved by the resort s team of carpenters there s a private plunge pool and even a mobile phone to reach a personal butler should I need him but they aren t a cocoon Lying beneath the mosquito net of my four poster bed I watch and listen and drift off to sleep The frogs keep calling like pipers on a battlefield The view from the terrace at Ladera Resort whose rooms and suites sit on a volcano ridgeline above the Caribbean Sea with excellent vistas of the iconic Pitons Photograph by Christina Holmes It s a dramatic first night but then volcanic St Lucia was born out of nature at its most frenetic heaved from the bowels of the Earth There s a reminder of that genesis just a few minutes away You re about to smell something strange Jarvis Leonce tells me the next morning which isn t what you want to hear from a large man driving a small taxi with its windows closed Fortunately though he s talking about the smell of Soufrière a settlement whose French name translates as sulphur in the air in reference to the eggy scent that hangs over it This is a town built at the heart of a volcano The lava is only a mile below the surface says Yarmi Alexander a guide who meets me at the entrance of Sulphur Springs St Lucia a geothermal theme park of sorts The volcano could erupt at any time People here call it living on the edge They must be a hardy lot I think But the truth is the risk is low The last eruption was in and it wasn t violent Yarmi tells me Volcanoes don t just blow without warning We have instruments to monitor activity and nature offers signs animals start to leave and the plants die Bubbling mud at Sulphur Springs a geothermal field exhibiting remnants of a volcanic eruption years ago Photograph by Christina Holmes However there s a persistent danger here for those who fail to respect the volcano We walk a short path past lush ferns and a series of little waterfalls to a place that seems the very counterpoint to life itself The greenery abruptly gives way to a barren swathe of ash white rocks and pools of dull mud that bubble violently like witches cauldrons Steam billows and the odour of sulphur stings my nostrils Three jet black birds flit about like bad omens It could be a stage set for the devil When the volcano erupted years ago the cone collapsed and this is what was left explains Yarmi The temperature of the springs thick with mud is and in the past visitors would walk out across the baked crusty surface to boil potatoes in the pools But an accident changed all that a tourist guide named Gabriel suffered seconddegree burns after falling through He was jumping up and down to prove to his group that the surface would support his weight Yarmi says shaking her head She points to where it happened We call it Gabriel s Hole she confides which must have been the cherry on top of the embarrassment suffered by poor old Gabriel Pineapple jerk chicken with salad from Cool Runnings Kitchen a gourmet food truck in Gros Islet Photograph by Christina Holmes But treated with care the sulphur springs work wonders Nearby are mud baths a joyous wallowing spot where locals and tourists alike gather to splash and laugh in three chocolate hued pools Taxi driver Jarvis has returned to take me through the experience because like someone following a cherished family recipe he believes there s a proper way of doing things First I must be soaked I ease myself into a hot pool the mud at the bottom soft between my toes and lie back making angel wings on the surface Once warmed through I m removed from the pool to be basted all over in sloppy grey mud from a bucket Next I m left to dry for a few minutes the mud hardening on my skin And then the finishing touches Jarvis works from another bucket of darker mud applying dabs here and there to my chest and legs with the care of a pastry chef piping icing He spends most of his time on my back though and seems to write a message of some sort soon I begin to worry I might be the victim of a practical joke and that other bathers will take it in turns to kick me But when his work is complete Jarvis shows me a photo on his phone and I see he s painted an impressive profile of the Piton Mountains and the words St Lucia across my shoulders Up the mountain The Pitons are St Lucia s best known landmark a pair of lava domes called Gros Piton and Petit Piton that appear on everything from postcards to bottles of local beer Gros Piton is the taller by and has a two mile hiking trail to the top that I just have to try When I meet my guide Marva Williams as in marvellous she says playfully I learn that it has history too The village here at the start of the trail is called Fond Gens Libre Valley of the Free People because it was established by escaped slaves Marva explains We pass a scattering of colourful houses with corrugated roofs An old man bids us good morning from his doorway standing behind a handwritten board advertising his hardboiled eggs and homemade ice cream Cacao trees and their pods thrive in the volcanic soil of St Lucia Photograph by Christina Holmes Most St Lucians are descendants of slaves brought from West Africa between the and centuries by French or British colonists who were forever wrestling for control of this strategic base in the Caribbean Slaves were worked to collapse on the plantations boiling up sugar cane in great iron cauldrons that you can still see around the island now rusting and sometimes filled with flowers or turned into fish ponds Captured runaways were burnt with molten molasses or executed by guillotine in Soufrière s main square But in the late fired with the spirit of the French Revolution the slaves rebelled and came together as freedom fighters under the leadership of a fierce woman called Flore Bois Gaillard They were known as the Brigands Enacting brutal poetic justice they caught and guillotined their former masters Flore razed the plantation she d been forced to work on killing the owner who d abused her over many years So determined were the Brigands that they even succeeded in driving the British from St Lucia for a time ushering in a year of freedom before the status quo resumed These were turbulent volcanic times Gros Piton was Brigand territory The trail begins gently enough wrapping lazily around the side of the mountain There are mango trees and red cedars and a coppercoloured tree called wild gombie whose bark peels like sunburnt skin and is boiled in tea to settle upset stomachs After a while we reach a stopping point high above a river so meandering in its journey to the coast that the area is named Drunken Bay The sea lapping at the cove below is gin clear The slaves used this as a lookout beating a drum or blowing a conch to warn the others when they saw a ship coming in Marva tells me The view across Drunken Bay a lookout point runaway slaves would use to spot ships Photograph by Christina Holmes And when they did they could disappear up the mountain None could have covered the trail quicker than Marva however She crabs her way over roots and rocks in a sideways climbing style that couldn t be described as graceful but is certainly speedy I hold the record she announces proudly Thirty eight minutes up and minutes down Today with me in tow it ll take more than three hours As the gradient steepens my breathing becomes heavy and my T shirt damp and clinging I scrabble across a trunk toppled during Hurricane Elsa a few months ago and slide briefly heart in mouth on a boulder made slippery with lichen A breeze sweeps in and the branches of the surrounding trees creak like a ship s rigging An hour has passed before we reach the only other hikers we ll meet a couple of American honeymooners sitting silent at the edge of the trail their faces red with effort and strands of hair plastered to their foreheads I sense we ve interrupted a frank exchange of views Three out of people give up Marva tells me when we re out of earshot They say I m on vacation this is too much like hard work But there s no way you re going back down early on my watch I m getting you to the top all She s as good as her word Some minutes later we emerge abruptly from the narrow neck of the trail into a glade with yellow mountain flowers and a pile of rocks where lizards bask in the sun A bronze breasted bullfinch peeps boldly at us and takes some biscuit from my fingers We re at the peak Congratulations on conquering the mountain Marva says producing a couple of bottles of Piton lager she s been carrying in her rucksack Below the landscape undulates with dark green hills their ridges veined with multicoloured rooftops The sea melts into a hazy horizon Weathering the storm The next day after driving to the north of the island I meet two people whose lives have been transformed by that sea Their names are OB and Krishna and they crew a traditional sloop Good Expectations in Rodney Bay It s a beautiful clearly cherished boat painted yellow and blue with a mast that s glossy with varnish OB sits crosslegged at the tiller threading a careful course through the marina Respect respect he calls to a man who passes in a dinghy and then offers me a beer from a cooler box We treat you right he says with a grin OB s is a feel good story Languishing on a scheme for the unemployed he was offered a chance to try sailing by James Crockett co owner of a small charter company called Jus Sail In that moment the wind filled OB s sails too For the first time I d found something I could commit to he says This sloop was built on a beach by guys who used the horizon to make sure its lines were straight Above us the boom swings and pulleys whirr Krishna tugging on ropes until the sail bulges tight Yeah there s something about a sailboat James chooses those who are passionate Krishna says settling again on the deck She too was a recruit on Jus Sail s training programme for disadvantaged local youth and has even sailed across the Atlantic I was seasick for a few days but I had to get over it Like OB Krishna is conscious of another path she might be walking If it weren t for James I don t know where I d be Aboard the traditional sloop Good Expectations with Krishna Joseph left and O Brian Forde known as OB from the Jus Sail team in Rodney Bay Photograph by Christina Holmes We re in open sea now following the coast and unpicking its tales There s Pigeon Island bristling with century fortifications built by British Admiral Rodney and with a snack shack named after a notorious pirate called Peg Leg le Clerc who lived here in the and pounced on passing treasure ships We also see The Naked Fisherman restaurant on the beach where local anglers come with their catch in the morning They fish naked so the hooks don t catch their clothes Krishna explains Word spread and crowds of tourists started gathering at to watch the naked guys selling fish For a while that place was booming OB laughs But now the naked fishermen have to wear shorts The breeze lifts and the sloop tugs eagerly onward She s heavy but she s fast OB says returning to his favourite subject Back in the day boats like this were used for smuggling rum cattle everything A brown booby skims low across the sea before rising abruptly and dropping with a savage stab at something beneath Once we were in a regatta when a storm blew up he continues There was a catamaran all carbon fibre this and that and it never stood a chance Its sail tore and engine packed up But this vessel cut through the storm as if it was nothing She s been put to the test He falls silent as he gazes at the distinctive shapes of frigate birds gliding on the breeze and I realise with a jolt that this sloop hasn t just provided OB with a better life it s become a metaphor for his life itself Late morning the next day I arrive at a food truck in a bustling lay by beside a main road in Gros Islet I ve a lunch appointment with Stacey Martin But you cookin all I doin is watchin Stacey says firmly when I arrive before swaddling me in an apron and wedging a chef s hat on my head then setting me to work chopping spring onion Next I m stirring a bowl of flour and shredded codfish adding hot sauce and watching Stacey demonstrate how to roll the dough into balls I roll my own drop them into the deep fat fryer and a few minutes later remove a dozen crispy accras salt fish fritters a Caribbean speciality and await Stacey s judgement Well let s see who s gonna die first she says and takes a bite It s nice beautiful in fact she nods approvingly Although rather large she adds tempering her praise so it doesn t go to my head Chef Stacy Martin at her Cool Runnings Kitchen truck Gros Islet Photograph by Christina Holmes Stacey is a force of nature as formidable as any on the island a whirlwind in leopardprint shoes Covid hit hard When she lost her job at a bar Stacey turned a negative into a positive by making real a long held dream to become a cook and open her own business Now customers drive from miles around to collect lunches of braised oxtail and green fig salad from her Cool Runnings Kitchen truck She s up before dawn preparing pots of goat curry and after the lunches are served she heads off for her evening shift as a waitress at Cap Maison Resort Spa Now she s offering cooking experiences for travellers too I have a lot of energy she tells me unnecessarily Everyone knows Stacey Cars honk as they pass the truck which is as unforgettable as its owner every inch painted with palm trees and the gold and green of the Jamaican flag Stacey was born there This guy he made accras today she calls to a man with a cigarette in his mouth who s sitting on a nearby wall They were quite big Once you ve done it you never forget the man replies with a broad smile When we ve finished eating Stacey takes me on a tour of the lay by community past the car wash and Jake s Barber Shop to a drinks van with a sign outside saying No credit My friends are those who pay Owner Steve hands us beers across the counter After a meal you gotta have a cold one Stacey explains We sit on plastic chairs and drink as the vacuum hums in the car wash and cars drive past Life s all about the good times calls our friend who s still perched on the wall And he s right to a point But Stacey and OB and the whistling frogs in the forests know it s about the tough times too and how you weather the storms ESSENTIALS Getting there around British Airways flies
