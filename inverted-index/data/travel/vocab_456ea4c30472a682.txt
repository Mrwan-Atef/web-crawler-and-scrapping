Yelapa Puerto Vallarta Mexico Attractions Lonely Planet Lonely Planet Destinations Planning Inspiration Shop Search Saves Open main menu karamysh Shutterstock Yelapa Puerto Vallarta Mexico North America Top choice in Puerto Vallarta Login Save Home to a small fishing community the picturesque beach of Yelapa hugs an emerald coastline backed by jungle shrouded mountains The remote coastal village which sits on Puerto Vallarta s southernmost cove is best reached by boat In recent years Yelapa has seen an ever increasing stream of day trippers turning up but it reveals a much quieter side after the last water taxi returns to Puerto Vallarta and the busy beach empties out in the late afternoon An overnight stay allows you to appreciate the town with fewer visitors around and the laid back vibe makes for a refreshing change of pace from bustling downtown Puerto Vallarta Sleeping Yelapa has some excellent places to stay many perched on jungle covered hills overlooking the cove Accommodations range from budget friendly apartments and small family run hotels to luxury guesthouses and wellness retreats tucked away in the surrounding tropical mountains Rates increase significantly during the high season from December to April and should be reserved months ahead Casa Vista Magica and Casas Garcia provide good value Some places have rooms with an open air setup meaning you get refreshing ocean breezes but also a fair share of mosquitoes so don t forget that insect repellent Eating and drinking For a small village of just inhabitants Yelapa has an impressive number of eating options Numerous palapa thatched roof seafood restaurants overlook the beach and river that cuts through town while west of the river you ll come across about a dozen hillside cafes taco joints and family run eateries serving traditional Mexican cuisine and gringo friendly fare Taquería los Abuelos draws praise for its fish tacos served on blue corn tortillas Ray s Place does Sunday birria a local goat stew fave and Domingo s grills pescado zarandeado a regional grilled fish dish which goes down nicely with a michelada cubana a Bloody Mary like beer cocktail After the meal look for one of Yelapa s so called pie ladies who roam the beach carrying delicious coconut banana and lime pies on their heads Sights and activities There s not a whole lot to do in Yelapa so most people make it a point to visit one of two cascading waterfalls with natural pools The nearest fall takes just minutes to reach from the beach and it s a simple uphill walk through town with plenty of signs along the way to point you in the right direction However due to its fairly easy access the Cola de Caballo Horse Tail waterfall can get very busy especially during peak tourist season and even more so when cruise ships roll into Puerto Vallarta If you re looking to avoid the crowds set out on a hike to a remote waterfall outside of town Pick up the trail on the west side of the river and head inland along a path that requires several river crossings Once you get past the second crossing the trail is well marked though you ll have to do some rock scrambling on the final stretch Keep in mind that the river may be more difficult to cross during the rainy season from June to October The hour and a half hike through the tropical jungle leads to a swimming hole with a waterfall albeit a smaller one than the Cola de Caballo but with any luck you ll have the place all to yourself Bring a bathing suit hiking sandals snacks insect repellent and plenty of water Both falls can also be reached on horseback Fannys Restaurant on the beach rents horses for outings to Cola de Caballo US and to the waterfall out of town US Aside from swimming at the waterfalls and relaxing on the beach you can keep yourself pleasantly entertained on a stroll through town along hilly paths overlooking the cove or there s always the option of renting a kayak and exploring the coast in and around Yelapa You ll also find a fair share of yoga studios in the village but some close during the low season How to get there Accessible by water taxis or private boats Yelapa is a minute ride from the
