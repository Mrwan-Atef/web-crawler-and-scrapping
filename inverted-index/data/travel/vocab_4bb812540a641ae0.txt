adventures that will appeal to the entire family Â Stefan Cioata Getty Images Jordan is a massively underrated destination for family travel especially for more adventurous and outdoorsy groups The country has no shortage of open spaces to run hike or cycle alongside fully accessible ancient ruins to explore As a bonus Arab tradition usually calls for big families and lots of dedicated family time so thereâ s no lack of activities for children of all ages People are accustomed to dealing with kids and are often very friendly so donâ t be surprised if someone offers your child a sweet or a trinket Is Jordan good for kids Family is extremely important to Jordanians and people are often open and relaxed with children Respect space and help are routinely offered to pregnant women and families Advertisement While the Jordanian people are very friendly towards children traveling to Jordan can present unique challenges for families including lack of public transportation and sidewalks variable road safety and indoor smoking That said restaurants all have non smoking areas by law and many have outdoor seating to complement the beautiful weather Itâ s also good to note that public breastfeeding is strongly discouraged and the country is generally not stroller friendly due to uneven roads Nevertheless places will make every effort to accommodate your family and make your stay as comfortable as possible so donâ t be shy and ask for whatever you need Also many attractions have free entry or discounts for children and most restaurants have a kids menu for pickier eaters Kids will enjoy exploring the ancient amphitheater in the heart of Amman Â Georgios Tsichlis Shutterstock Where is best in Jordan for kids The capital city of Amman boasts a few fun museums and ruins but the most fun activities are a little off the beaten path From snorkeling and scuba diving to cable car rides and stargazing in an indescribably massive sandbox Jordan has a lot to offer just beneath the surface Best things to do in Jordan with kids Check out Amman s fun museums Right next to each other in Ammanâ s Al Hussein public parks are the Childrenâ s Museum and the Royal Automobile Museum The Childrenâ s Museum is a favorite of local families and is a safe fun and stimulating spot for younger kids while the Royal Automobile Museum is loved by kids and adults alike for its collection of oddities classics and sports cars Relax like a Roman at the amphitheater Advertisement The Roman Theater is a must see This millennia old seat theater is fully accessible and free to enter and explore The Al Hussein Plaza which houses the theater is one of the largest open spaces in the city and an optimal place for a game of soccer or a picnic an idea shared by many Ammanis Connect with nature in Ajloun The northern city of Ajloun is largely dominated by the beautiful and serene Ajloun Forest Reserve which boasts some of the greatest biodiversity in the country It harbors cycling and hiking trails as well as a cable car ride through the forest From March to November the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature operates forest lodges that serve as great bases for exploring nature watching and relaxing Get up close and personal with the rare Arabian oryx at the Shaumari Wildlife Reserve Â Ondrej Prosicky Shutterstock Best things to do in Jordan with teens and tweens Try a cycling safari in Al Shaumari Located in the eastern desert the Shaumari Wildlife Reserve is one of the very few places in the world where one can still see the Arabian oryx and very likely the only place on Earth where you can cycle among them as they graze and saunter around the area You can rent the bikes here and the rides are unique safe and not too strenuous Stargaze in Wadi Rum Wadi Rum is a staple for travelers to Jordan for good reason There is a variety of different camps to choose from ranging from glam bubble tents to the full Bedouin experience and no shortage of fun if you make camp yourself There are rock climbing tours alongside smaller boulders that need no guides or invitation as well as sand dunes to roll down and even options for a pricey if unforgettable hot air balloon ride See the Red Sea Make the trip to Aqaba and stay at the Ayla or Tala Bay compounds for the complete Jordanian vacation Opt for one of the area s luxurious resorts or rent an apartment for a more down to earth stay â either way you ll be able to experience the beauty of the Red Sea Few places can boast the beauty of Aqabaâ s reefs water clarity and concentration of wildlife making it a perfect place for snorkeling and scuba diving whether from a boat or off the beach For more high octane fun families can try a whole host of water sports ranging from pedalos to paragliding The Dead Sea is an iconic Jordan stop better suited to older kids and teens Â Max Topchii Shutterstock Planning tips The Jordan Pass which includes the on arrival visa and most historical attractions is worthwhile only if your children are above the ages of Younger kids enter the major attractions for free That said it is absolutely a worthwhile investment for parents and teenagers If you are planning to visit Petra keep in mind that it is a relatively demanding walk and the route is not stroller friendly and usually very hot While club cars and donkeys are available for rides these are often exploitatively priced Consider waiting until the kids are older and skipping the heat by doing the Petra by Night tour which isnâ t covered by the Jordan Pass The Dead Sea another must see Jordanian destination is not optimal for younger kids as getting the water into your eyes is excruciatingly painful and quite dangerous In general bring your own water and snacks as theyâ re not always available and if they are they are sometimes unreasonably priced Driving in Jordan can be challenging but it opens up many possibilities â consider booking a personal driver if you plan to go off the beaten path If youâ re planning a shorter stay Jett Bus is a comfortable economic mode of transport that goes to many of the major locations Within Amman the ridesharing apps Uber and Careem are the way to go Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Jordan Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers Everywhere Follow us
