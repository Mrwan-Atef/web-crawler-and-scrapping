This airline is now weighing passengers but why The Finnish airline is starting to weigh its passengers but why And is it a practice that s here to stay Photograph by Wirestock Inc Alamy TRAVEL This airline is now weighing passengers but why Finnish airline Finnair is checking the weight of its passengers to ensure its planes are operating safely Here s what that means for travelers By Ben Clatworthy February This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Asking passengers to step onto the scales before boarding a flight was always going to be a controversial move Agitated commentators raged accusing Finnair which is Finland s national carrier of humiliating passengers and being triggering to people with eating disorders Delve a little deeper however and such outrage isn t entirely justified with safety and crucially anonymity at the heart of the airline s data collection exercise An accurate understanding of the weight of an aircraft is vital for aviation safety and as the make up of society changes the charts and tables used by flight crew need updating Finnair insists its weigh in is voluntary although such assurance may struggle to appease those fearful of a rather public date with the scales Why is Finnair weighing passengers Central to the whole scheme is each aircraft s maximum takeoff mass the weight at which it can safely leave the ground This is specified by the manufacturer and must be strictly observed But weight is also a major factor in working out how much fuel a plane should carry and in calculating its range and potential emergency landing sites As airlines don t weigh every passenger or their hand luggage a lot of averages are incorporated into those calculations Over time these need to be reviewed as society changes especially given that public health data points towards a general increase in average body weight per person What does it entail Broadly airlines have two options when it comes to weight data They can either use standard issue data from official bodies such as the European Union Aviation Safety Agency EASA or the UK Civil Aviation Authority CAA or collect it themselves Finnair has opted for the latter The airline will ask a random sample of passengers travelling in April and May to step onto the scales as it seeks to optimise its current aircraft balance calculations I don t want to be weighed Can I opt out Yes of course The airline is stressing that participation is entirely voluntary however it s also at pains to tell passengers who do take part that all data is anonymous Only the agent working at the gate will see the figure and Finnair won t link the recorded weight to the customer s name or booking reference The data will then be sent to the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency for approval It will be used in calculations until Satu Munnukka head of ground processes at Finnair said We record the total weight and background information of the customer plus their carry on baggage but we don t ask for their name or booking number for example Only the customer service agent working at the measuring point can see the total weight so you can participate in the study with peace of mind We hope to have a good sample of volunteers both business and leisure travellers so that we can get the most accurate information possible for important balance calculations Is the data regularly updated Yes Finnair updates its data about every five years while EASA last contracted Lufthansa Consulting to research passenger and luggage weight in Over months the aviation and management consulting company weighed passengers at six European airports and analysed pieces of checked luggage Lufthansa Consulting reported the average weight of male passengers as and for female passengers adding that there was no significant weight gain or loss observed for passengers in general since the previous survey in Overall it concluded that the mean value of all passengers is while the average carry on weight is This resulted in a mean passenger weight for adults plus their carry on luggage as in line with the existing regulation The research will be repeated in five years time Have other airlines weighed passengers Yes several other carriers including Korean Air and Air New Zealand have previously carried out similar large scale surveys Last year passengers travelling internationally from Auckland were weighed while in Uzbekistan Airways said it would have all passengers stand on the scales before boarding to ensure safety Some smaller airlines that operate turboprop planes also ask passengers to be weighed before boarding while it s common practice for helicopter companies Haven t we been here before Yes Airlines and aircraft manufacturers have always been acutely aware that every pound and ounce counts when it comes to flying On its inaugural San Francisco to New York flight in Boeing Air Transport ensured its aircraft carrying passengers and one flight attendant was no heavier than pounds at takeoff This required weighing everything including the passengers The practice continued until the mid when the US government first published standard tables that airlines could use to calculate the weight and balance of an aircraft to the relief of many passengers Is weighing passengers about to become a regular thing then So far there s certainly no indication that airlines may re introduce weighing at check in again All airline weighing programmes have so far been temporary data collection projects and none has introduced it as a permanent practice Ben Clatworthy is the Transport Correspondent at The Times To subscribe to National Geographic Traveller UK magazine click here Available in select countries
