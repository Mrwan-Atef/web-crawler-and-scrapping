here s what set jetting is and why travelers are embracing it The Hobbiton set in New Zealand allows tourists to explore structures and sites where The Lord of the Rings movies were shot It s an example of set jetting where travelers book trips based around TV shows or films Photograph Courtesy Hobbiton Movie Set By Mickey Rapkin March The third season of HBO s Emmy winning series The White Lotus is currently filming on Koh Samui a remote Thai island When the location was announced it was a moment of celebration for us says Gopal Kumar general manager of the Kamalaya Wellness Sanctuary Koh Samui a local spa resort His excitement was understandable the show has been a boon for tourism The first season of the mystery shot at the Four Seasons on Maui led to a percent increase in availability checks at the property The second season drove tourists to Sicily Sensing an opportunity the Thai government heavily courted the show s producers offering them million in tax incentives Destination promoters are calling it The White Lotus Effect It s part of a larger trend in tourism known as set jetting in which travelers pick a destination because a TV show or movie was shot there This isn t new Star Wars fans have been flocking to Death Valley a k a the planet Tatooine since the and New Zealand tourism estimates that one in five travelers visits because of the The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit The exposure is product placement explains Simon Hudson a tourism professor at the University of South Carolina Or destination placement But that compelling place you saw onscreen might look and feel a bit different in person Here s how to couch your cinematic expectations with on the ground reality Emily in Paris Wednesday in Bucharest Set jetting has taken on a fevered pitch of late Hudson reports perhaps due to people binge watching during COVID lockdowns Shows with memorable settings Bridgerton Emily in Paris Squid Game fed their wanderlust There was that pent up demand for travel he says Expedia s Unpack Study a report on global travel trends found that two thirds of worldwide tourists considered visiting a place because they saw it on a small or big screen Netflix s Wednesday was credited with a percent spike in searches for Romania Viator currently offers multiple tours of Bucharest featuring locations used in the series Even more revealing percent of travelers surveyed actually booked those trips This perhaps prompted the Washington Post to publish a proposed tour of Alberta Canada inspired by the apocalyptic HBO series The Last of Us minus the zombies Tourism promoters are even designing marketing plans around popular shows filmed or linked to their destinations There s nothing else which can really offer that kind of platform to a global audience of potential travelers says Robin Johnson global marketing director for Visit Britain You can go from a standing start to absolutely monumental interest In fact later this year Visit Britain will launch a marketing campaign Starring Great Britain to lure fans of shows like Ted Lasso which shot in southwest London After Castle Howard was featured on Bridgerton the estate in North Yorkshire saw a percent increase in visits to their website from the to year old demographic Travel to these six places if you love Star Wars Separating fact from fiction Do your research before leaving home since set jetters who arrive with certain expectations may be disappointed Hudson says He recalls fans of Captain Corelli s Mandolin descending on Kefalonia Greece only to find the film s sets had been dismantled Notting Hill fans determined to enjoy the London park where Hugh Grant romanced Julia Roberts should plan accordingly since the private Rosemead Garden is open to the public just once a year Viewers who saw Poor Things and began plotting trips to Lisbon or Paris won t find the film s candy colored landscapes most scenes were shot in Budapest or on sound stages New Zealand s government by contrast invested in Hobbiton a theme park where visitors can tour the actual The L ord of the Rings sets two decades after the first film s release Devotees of The White Lotus who check into San Domenico Palace Taormina where season two was filmed will find it much the same as the show down to the staff uniforms and a bar manager who played a restaurant maître d on TV Want to stay in Jennifer Coolidge s room Book the Royal Suite But even set jetting destinations that deliver aren t exact copies At the San Domenico Palace guests can t just wander straight onto a sandy beach like Aubrey Plaza and Michael Imperioli seemingly did The Italian hotel is perched on a cliff hence the dramatic views and while there s a beach in Taormina the one seen on screen is actually in Cefalù miles away on the northern coast of Sicily People lounge in Luxembourg Gardens where several scenes from Emily in Paris were filmed Photograph by KRISTA ROSSOW NAT GEO IMAGE COLLECTION Netflix s Emily in Paris prominently features a neighborhood bistro called Les Deux Compères which specializes in Normandy cuisine Fans regularly pose outside the restaurant which in real life is called Terra Nera But it s Italian not French The pub featured on Ted Lasso is a real place The Prince s Head in Richmond but like Cheers in Boston the interior was shot on a soundstage In cases like these set jetters might benefit from consulting a travel agent For fans of Emily in Paris Virtuoso an international network of high end travel agents tracked down the real chef from Normandy who consulted on the series directing clients to Anona his farm to table restaurant in Paris James Bond aficionados can consult Black Tomato which recently launched a customizable luxe package with options like a London training session with Daniel Craig s stunt double and a stop at a chateau in Champagne France to taste a rare La Grand Anne e vintage that Bond sipped in Casino Royale There are websites dedicated to showing you exactly where places were filmed says a Virtuoso spokesperson Misty Belles But getting access is another thing altogether Retrace Oppenheimer s footsteps and filming sites around the U S How film sites combat overtourism What if a flood of tourists ruins the very thing that captivated viewers in the first place It s a legitimate question the industry wrestles with Thailand s Maya Baya which was featured prominently in Leonardo DiCaprio s film The Beach had to close to tourists for more than three years to stem the damage done to its coral reefs Tourists sit along the rocks of Mount Srd admiring the panoramic view of Dubrovnik s walled Old Town The Croatian city has experienced an influx of visitors since many scenes from Game of Thrones were filmed there Photograph by JILL SCHNEIDER NAT GEO IMAGE COLLECTION Dubrovnik experienced overcrowding in the wake of Game of Thrones Croatia s capital stood in for the show s fictional King s Landing and became such a popular destination that American Airlines added a direct flight from Philadelphia to Dubrovnik The government welcomed the tourist dollars million from to by one estimate but the influx of travelers put a strain on the city s infrastructure and decency laws Thrones fans made headlines for stripping down naked and strolling through the center of town an homage to one character s infamous walk of shame At one point Dubrovnik s Old City was so overrun it was in danger of losing its status as a UNESCO World Heritage site forcing the mayor to limit the number of daily tourists Perhaps fearing the same the government of Svalbard Norway declined a request from Tom Cruise s Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning to film there Courting tourists while preserving local charm is a delicate balance Visit Britain s Robin Johnson suggests travelers be curious The way he tells it his office hopes to use shows like Poldark shot in Cornwall Peaky Blinders Birmingham and Bridgerton Bath as Trojan Horses For example come for Harry Potter s Platform and at London s King s Cross Station stay for a trip to a smaller city The film location he says is the hook to then tell the broader story Expedia s study predicted a spike in travel to Sydney Australia where the Mad Max prequel Furiosa due out in May was filmed That report also cited interest in Surrey England thanks to HBO s House of the Dragon and Budapest Dune Part Two If the new FX series Shōgun has people excited about a trip to Japan that s understandable But viewers should know The show was shot entirely in Vancouver Mickey Rapkin is a Los Angeles based
