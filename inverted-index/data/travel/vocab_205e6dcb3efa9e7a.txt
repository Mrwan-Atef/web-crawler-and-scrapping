the chain where to find Dubai s best indie shops Georgina Wilson Powell Feb min read Share Dubai may be home to the biggest mall in the world and consumerism might possibly be in the cityâ s very DNA but there are alternatives to chain store shopping for luxury labels The city has a growing independent shopping scene hidden in detached villas or smaller community malls that will ensure you go home

for souvenirs Antique Museum Do not believe either word in its name this dusty warehouse in Al Quoz behind Times Square Mall is not a museum nor does it sell antiques It is however a veritable Aladdinâ s cave of Middle Eastern trinkets from glass mosaic hanging candle holders to tajine dishes and carved wooden furniture You can lose hours in the massive warehouse where everything is piled high in narrow corridors but keep browsing and the staff will bring you cups of tea and water to keep you going First published in July https shop lonelyplanet com products dubai abu dhabi city guide
