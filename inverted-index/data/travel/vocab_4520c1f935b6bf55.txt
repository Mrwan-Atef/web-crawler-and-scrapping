scooters to trains and ferries these are the best ways to get around Sardinia Â Â Stefano Oppo Getty Images Despite being the Mediterranean s second largest island Sardinia is relatively compact measuring roughly north to south and east to west You can cross the entire island in a few hours though sinuous two lane roads and limited rail and bus connections can make short distances more time consuming to cover than you might expect Traveling with your own car motorbike or bicycle makes it much easier to explore Sardinia s beaches archaeological sites and other destinations not well served by public transport Sardinia is easiest to explore with your own vehicle Vehicle rentals Europcar Sixt Hertz Avis and other international operators rent out vehicles at Sardinia s three main airports in Cagliari Olbia and Alghero alongside Italian rental chains such as Maggiore and Only Sardinia Smaller cities including Nuoro Oristano and Alghero also offer in town car hire while motorbike and scooter rentals are available in many beach resorts Electric cars are available for rent but charging stations are few and far between â and often slow Advertisement Rental car tips While many credit card companies offer complimentary CDW Collision Damage Waiver protection to their cardholders Italy is often excluded from the list of covered countries check before you rent Beware of narrow one way streets in smaller villages your car can easily get scratched or stuck Away from the main cities and beach resorts gas stations can be sparse especially in the mountain towns of Sardinia s interior save yourself headaches by fueling up ahead of time Road classifications Sardinia has a handful of faster multi lane highways known as superstrade SS for short these include the connecting Cagliari Oristano Sassari and Porto Torres and sections of the running down Sardinia s east coast Superstrade are toll free with speed limits topping out at h Away from these main routes be prepared for slower driving on two lane often curvy provincial roads known as strade provinciali SP where the speed limit ranges from h in town to h outside city limits Note that many smaller access roads to beaches and trailheads are unpaved Having your own set of wheels in Sardinia gives you plenty of freedom but make sure you know the rules of the road Â SimonSkafar Getty Images Parking In cities parking spaces designated with blue stripes require payment via street side ticket machines or a phone app such as DropTicket Rates are highest â per hour during normal business hours and Mon Sat Free or reduced rates apply on evenings Sundays and during lunch hours Parking spaces marked with white stripes are free of charge Every Sardinian municipality has its own rules for beach parking which can cost as much as â per hour Fee collection is typically managed by private companies which often employ onsite parking attendants Beware of hefty fines for parking outside designated areas in summer if you do get a ticket it s best to pay on the spot as delayed payment can result in higher charges being billed to your credit card by the rental car company Cycling Cycling is an agreeable way to explore the Sardinian countryside and rentals are available in most larger towns and coastal resorts Bikes can be carried on Sardinian trains for a â surcharge Advertisement The bus is Sardinia s most versatile public transport option For exploring beyond the main cities the bus is Sardinia s most convenient public transport option ARST operates an extensive well priced network of bus routes connecting key destinations around the island including many not reachable by rail ARST has full fledged bus stations in Alghero Sassari Olbia Nuoro Oristano Iglesias and Cagliari In smaller towns buy tickets from a local bar or tobacconist and catch buses at stops marked with a Fermata signpost From national rails to local tourist trains Sardinia has options when it comes to train travel Â Roman Babakin Getty Images Railways are limited in Sardinia but useful for travel between main cities Trenitalia Trenitalia Italy s national rail system offers a core network of routes in Sardinia From Cagliari trains run west to Iglesias and Carbonia north to Oristano Sassari and the Porto Torres ferry terminal and northeast to Olbia and the Golfo Aranci ferry terminal There are departures every hour or two on the main routes and prices are reasonable even the longest journeys such as the four hour trip from Cagliari to Olbia generally cost less than â ARST regional trains ARST operates a supplementary narrow gauge rail network serving corners of the island not reached by Trenitalia Most useful to visitors are the trains connecting Sassari to Alghero on the northwest coast and the route from Macomer to Nuoro an ideal jumping off point for exploring eastern Sardinia Tip for train transfers In Macomer and Sassari where the Trenitalia and ARST railways intersect each company has its own separate station â but they re within easy walking distance of one another Sardinia s scenic tourist trains Encompassing of narrow gauge railways Sardinia s extensive tourist train network offers visitors a compelling glimpse of Sardinia s backcountry Originally constructed in the to navigate the steep grades and sweeping curves of Sardinia s mountainous interior these less traveled routes were popularized by DH Lawrence in his book Sea and Sardinia These days the uber scenic Trenino Verde Little Green Train offers five official routes around the island Service is slow h seasonal and prone to frequent shutdowns check online to see which lines are currently operating Explore Sardinia s islands via its robust ferry system Â Getty Images Ferries are great for exploring Sardinia s offshore
