read Share The vistas youâ ll see when hiking in Oman are otherworldly Â Paul Biris Getty Images Away from the cities white sand beaches and fishing villages along the coast Oman â s craggy interior is truly rewarding for adventurers in hiking boots Deep within the Hajar Mountains lie cliff top villages lost in time terraced farms and date plantations barren valleys and peaks and natural springs and wadis valleys or riverbeds with turquoise pools of water that invite you to jump or wade in Advertisement A network of marked and well maintained trails makes adventure trekking in Oman easy for independent if experienced hikers While popular trails can be busy on the weekends you might not come across other hikers for long sections of more challenging trails Should you get lost Omanis are usually friendly enough to escort you back to the trail point you in the right direction or even give you a lift Still trekking with a local guide means youâ ll get valuable insights into Omani traditions and the way of life in remote villages A view of old Muscat opens up along the trail from Riyam to Mutrah Â Ronsmith Shutterstock Riyam to Mutrah Best city hike miles hours easy If youâ re looking to stretch your legs in Muscat the Riyam to Mutrah hike the route is an excellent way to make the most of an afternoon while seeing the capital from a different perspective While this hike can be done in either direction we recommend beginning in Riyam close to Riyam Park and finishing in Mutrah with its shaded seating areas and benches along Mutrah Corniche This easy to moderate hike takes you along what was once the only overland route between Mutrah and old Muscat From Riyam the old rocky trail continues up a hill via stone steps once used by villagers to bring agricultural produce wares and goats to sell at Mutrah Souq The rusty pipeline along the steps is from a time when the countryâ s only power station was located in Riyam fueled by diesel oil pumped through the pipes from a ship docked in Mutrah This route offers fantastic views over Mutrah harbor Riyam Park and old Muscat with glimpses of the sea beyond You might also find rock pools of water and some water in the wadis between November and April The trail leads to the ruins of an abandoned village before it descends to a wadi with steep walls where some scrambling is required Once through turn left approaching the cemetery to reach the end of the hike Itâ s called Jebel Akhdar Green Mountain for a reason Â trabantos Shutterstock Jebel Akhdar Best hike for mountain villages and farms miles hours easy Advertisement Jebel Akhdar Green Mountain in the western Hajar Mountains is home to verdant terraced slopes and valley villages with temperatures that are at lower than Muscat year round At itâ s one of the best places to go trekking in Oman especially if your idea of gorgeous scenery involves more olive trees and apple orchards than dry rocky wadis On the trek youâ ll hike from the village of Al Aqor to Sayq passing through the settlements of Al Ayn and Ash Shirayjah along the way Expect a pleasant walk on an old trail that involves some steep stone steps as you walk by old stone houses alongside narrow aflaj century old irrigation channels that water the terraced farms sloping below and through leafy orchards that offer respite from the sun Farms in the area are actively engaged in agriculture growing apples pears pomegranates walnuts almonds grapes and tomatoes â but since they are private property resist the temptation to pluck the fruit In April and May blooming pink damask roses are a wondrous sight in the area and rose water is distilled in the villages often using traditional methods both for sale and personal use During this season you may be able to see the process in action inquire at your accommodations or try your luck asking around in the villages Omanis are friendly and more often than not know someone who knows someone who can help Wadi Bani Khalid to Wadi Tiwi Best challenging wadi hike miles hours challenging The trail from Wadi Bani Khalid to Wadi Tiwi is popular with serious hikers looking for a strenuous trekking adventure In the heart of the eastern Hajar Mountains this trek can be done over a single very long day as you gain an altitude of â though most hikers choose to camp on the plateau overnight and split the journey over two days Beginning at emerald hued natural pools in Wadi Bani Khalid just after the village of Miqil also spelled Muqal the route follows an old donkey trail and ascends to the highest point of relatively quickly four or five hours From the peak youâ ll take in remarkable views of the canyon and its fertile date plantations Youâ ll then traverse the plateau where you can watch the sunset and set up your tent before gradually descending into the wadi via rocky paths with donkeys eagles and mountain goats for company Some sections are steeper than others with scrambling required Youâ ll finish at the villages of Sooee and Al Aqur in Wadi Tiwi where you can cool off with a swim Nearby Mibam village with its farms and waterfall is also worth a visit Itâ s recommended to go with a local guide Wadi Shab Adventures can arrange one for you A swim at glorious Wadi Tiwi is your reward after a vigorous day of hiking Â trabantos Shutterstock Jebel Shams Best summit hike miles hours moderate In the western Hajar Mountains is Omanâ s highest peak at Jebel Shams whose name in Arabic translates to â Mountain of the Sun â This rugged landscape of limestone crags parched riverbeds and villages perched on cliffs attracts hikers of all levels thanks to jaw dropping views of Wadi an Nakhur the countryâ s deepest canyon thatâ s often called the â Grand Canyon of Oman â The area has three marked trails of which the Jebel Shams summit hike officially the trek is both the most challenging and the most rewarding From the Jebel Shams plateau youâ ll hike along the rim of Saydran Gorge enjoying views of Wadi An Nakhur and Wadi Al Ghul and then continue through the rocky terrain and past juniper trees to Qarn Al Ghamaydah At this is the highest point you can reach on the southern summit a military outpost at the top restricts access Instead of doing the round trip over a very long day the ascent takes six hours and includes a elevation gain many hikers choose to camp overnight before they descend Husaak Adventures organizes guided hikes to the summit Jebel Shams Balcony Walk Best easy hike for canyon views miles hours easy Part of the trek the easier and therefore more popular Jebel Shams Balcony Walk begins at the village of Al Khitaym and takes you alongside steep canyon walls following the western rim of Wadi an Nakhur to the abandoned village of As Sab formerly called Sab Bani Khamis Once an agricultural village engaged in the cultivation of watermelons tomatoes lemons and wheat As Sab bears remnants of old stone houses terraced farms and ancient falaj irrigation channels that offer clues to life in the mountains in earlier times The families that inhabited the village now live in nearby Wadi Ghul and Al Hamra village and still own the houses A natural pool and cave lie just above the village and can be reached by a few minutesâ walk Past the lake a via ferrata route offers access to the plateau above but is recommended only if youâ re experienced and carrying the appropriate safety gear The views of the canyon are spectacular if dizzying with village houses in the depths and spotted eagles soaring overhead This hike can be done as a round trip in a leisurely four or five hours and is suitable for beginners and families Inspecting Wadi An Nakhur â the â Grand Canyon of Omanâ â from Jebel Shams Â Justin Foulkes Lonely Planet Tips for hiking in Oman The best time to go hiking in Oman is during the cooler months from November to April The weather can change quickly in the mountains and the risk of flash floods in the wadis is real so keep an eye on weather warnings before you go In the wadis expect to cross streams and scramble over rocks and boulders Proper preferably waterproof hiking shoes are a must and hiking poles are recommended Most mountain trails pass through villages that are quite traditional so itâ s best for both men and women to dress modestly with shoulders and knees covered To swim in the wadi pools women will appear more respectful in shorts and a t shirt rather than bikinis which are best avoided Donâ t underestimate the afternoon sun even in winter while hiking in the Hajar Mountains Carry a trekking hat and at least three liters of water per person for moderate hikes and more for longer ones You might also like must see natural wonders in Oman The top things to do in Oman are out of this world The
