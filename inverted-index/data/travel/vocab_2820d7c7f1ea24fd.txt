fact and fiction Whatever the truth his legacy is still felt and celebrated in Scotland s biggest city By Ronan O Connell January min read As tourists wander Glasgow they frequently pass an image of a gray haired monk who despite founding this Scottish city remains shrouded in mystery The most influential person in Glasgow history he adorns its city crest looms in its cathedral graces street murals and has his name on museums schools charities and sports clubs He is St Mungo the illegitimate son of an alleged witch thrown from a cliff while he was in her womb Baby Mungo somehow survived the first of many miracles linked to Glasgow s patron saint Glasgow Cathedral dedicated to St Mungo is the oldest church in mainland Scotland and the oldest building in Glasgow The patron saint is allegedly buried in the cathedral s crypt Photograph by Hemis Alamy Stock Photos Despite living some years ago he remains relevant in Glasgow such that each January a large festival celebrates his legacy What began as a small event in has bloomed into a flagship fair for Glasgow a proudly working class city of people in the country s south Now held over days St Mungo Festival offers free lectures musical performances and guided tours of locations linked to this holy man also known as St Kentigern Festival lecturer Dauvit Broun a professor at the University of Glasgow says even centuries of scholarly dissection haven t unravelled St Mungo s mysteries His story remains a murky melange of fact and fiction It is very difficult and in many cases ultimately hopeless to try to recover what actually happened in a saint s life says Broun No matter how slippery this holy man s tale helps explain the origin evolution and medieval wonders of Glasgow particularly to travelers who follow the St Mungo Heritage Trail or attend his festival Miraculous beginnings St Mungo was inexplicable from birth says Alan Macquarrie honorary research fellow of history at the University of Glasgow In A D Scottish princess Thenue became pregnant from an affair with a cousin and her furious father had her pushed off Traprain Law peak miles east of Edinburgh Glasgow Cathedral one of the few Scottish medieval churches to have survived the Reformation unscathed features a stained glass window showing the four evangelists Matthew Mark Luke and John along with their traditional emblems Photograph by iStockphoto Getty Images When Thenue somehow survived the king now convinced his daughter was a witch set her adrift in an oarless vessel on the nearby River Forth The boat landed safely at Culross in Fife Macquarrie says where she was met by St Serf the abbott of Culross monastery who acted as midwife at Kentigern s birth St Serf cared for Thenue helped raise her boy and guided him into priesthood After completing his religious training Mungo left Culross and encountered a dying holy man named Fergus whose final wish was to be hauled on a cart by bulls and buried wherever they halted Eventually these beasts paused in the green and serene Clyde Valley It was there Fergus was interred and Mungo established a church and a new community he named Glasgu This chapel developed into the magnificent century Glasgow Cathedral now the city s oldest building which is decorated by four symbols shared with the Glasgow crest The Glasgow coat of arms seen on the side of a trolleybus in Scotland Photograph by Douglas Carr Alamy Stock Photos Why Glasgow is Scotland s most exciting city right now That coat of arms which embellishes buildings throughout the city depicts a tree bell robin and salmon Each of these icons represents a famous St Mungo miracle says Patricia Barton lecturer in the history department at the University of Strathclyde Glasgow When students at St Serf s monastery accidentally killed a pet robin and blamed Mungo the boy held this bird engaged in prayer and sent it flapping back into the sky In another tale Mungo fell asleep while guarding the monastery s holy fire woke to find it extinguished and so snapped branches from a tree and prayed until they were set ablaze The image of a salmon biting a golden ring is linked to the king of Strathclyde who gifted his wife this jewelry Barton says When the king saw a knight wearing the queen s ring he became jealous stole it threw it in a river and demanded his wife retrieve it In desperation the queen sought help from Mungo who had a fish scooped from the river and cut it open to reveal the lost ring The bell meanwhile represents one that Mungo brought back to Glasgow from Rome Barton explains It was said to be miraculous she says of the bell If one prayed while it tolled during services St Kentigern would intercede On the trail of St Mungo Tourists can learn these wondrous tales while following the St Mungo Heritage Trail an online guide created by the Glasgow City Council Although the trail doesn t include St Mungo s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries
