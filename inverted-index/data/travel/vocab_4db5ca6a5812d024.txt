barbecue to Chinese restaurants to chic cocktail bars and beyond San Juanâ s food and drink scene has something for every taste Steph Segarra for Lonely Planet Many visitors may be surprised to find out that when it comes to food San Juan truly has it all This hasnâ t always been the case When I was growing up in the sprawling metropolitan area throughout the â and early the options were mostly limited to Puerto Rican Spanish and Caribbean fare along with our beloved â and ubiquitous â Chinese restaurants The Chinese presence dates back to at least the when a wave of Chinese laborers came from Cuba to Puerto Rico to help build the Carretera Central highway with restaurants soon opening to serve them While thereâ s no official count Puerto Rico is today home to some to Chinese restaurants and youâ re sure to find something delicious in all of them Fast forward years when the craft beer and cocktail explosion of the mid aughts attracted young entrepreneurs looking to spice up San Juanâ s culinary scene Advertisement The result On any given day in San Juan you can eat a typical Puerto Rican breakfast move on to French pastries have Korean or Japanese for lunch and get dinner at a Middle Eastern or Turkish joint Such variety is only one reason to make it to the city for a decadent long weekend to take in all it has to offer To get a proper taste of the cityâ s robust food offerings these are the places where I would take you At La Carreta Mercado Local opt for the abundant bandeja jÃ bara platter for breakfast Steph Segarra for Lonely Planet Breakfast Located on the cobblestone Calle Luna in Old San Juan La Carreta Mercado Local is a gorgeous restaurant with the high ceilings typical of century Spanish colonial architecture and wooden windows that seem transplanted from a country manor The Puerto Rican fare here â with unique takes on such breakfast staples as plantains avocado tropical fruits like guava and sweet breads â makes this one of my favorite places for brunch Because of its popularity the restaurant does not offer reservations so get there early to secure a spot inside or on the patio A favorite of mine is the bandeja jÃ bara a plate piled with traditional local staples like pernÃ l rice and beans bacon avocado a fried egg and sweet plantain Another favorite is La Carretaâ s modern take on the very traditional Mallorca sandwich which features traditional semi sweet dessert bread filled with scrambled eggs bacon and smoked Gouda then dusted with confectionerâ s sugar The menu changes seasonally so check out its Instagram feed to whet your appetite Bistro CafÃ started in Isla Verde in in a humble space close to the beach and has since expanded to two locations in Miami The approach to breakfast here stands out with gigantic plates filled with combinations like the omelet Monaco with shrimp spinach and feta cheese and strawberry shortcake pancakes Some of their drinks double as desserts like the pumpkin cappuccino which comes with a small tower of pumpkin pancakes and whipped cream as a topping Head here with plenty of time to eat up and digest afterward Iâ d start with the crÃ me brÃ lÃ e coffee â a super decadent dessert like treat The waffles are an excellent follow up their sweetness complemented by the saltiness of accompanying bacon and eggs Thereâ s also an excellent selection of mimosas usually two for one during brunch hours or â if you dare â an almond vanilla espresso martini When at Bistro CafÃ do not miss out on the strawberry shortcake pancakes Steph Segarra for Lonely Planet Coffee Puerto Rico has the best coffee on Earth â and Boricuas will definitely let you know whatâ s good I treasure Dosis CafÃ in Santurce because of its coziness its displays of artwork depicting native flora and fauna and its friendly baristas Advertisement Itâ s also one of the few places in town outside of chains like Starbucks where you can enjoy iced coffee The mocha iced coffee is to die for as is the carrot mini loaf Just around the corner on the same street youâ ll find the small baking studio Luloâ s As Chef Andreaâ s commercial kitchen it isnâ t a sit down place Yet you can buy a few choice sample desserts â and if you happen to come when theyâ re baking the crÃ me brÃ lÃ e cake expect a rare treat Also in Santurce Hacienda San Pedro makes traditional Puerto Rican coffee with beans straight from their farm in the mountain town of Jayuya The hot lotte a cup you shouldnâ t miss Puerto Rico might have the best coffee on Earth â and Hacienda San Pedro might have the best coffee in San Juan Steph Segarra for Lonely Planet Lunch Puerto Rican arepas differ from those made elsewhere in Latin America here theyâ re made with wheat flour water butter salt sugar and coconut Traditionally made in the town of Fajardo and only found in the northeastern part of the island they had been a craving hard to satisfy in San Juan Yet when La PreÃ a opened in Calle LoÃ za that all changed This restaurant specializes in Fajardo style flour and coconut arepas filled with a variety of ingredients My go to order is the octopus arepa with cilantro and aioli with the tripleta â filled with three meats hot dog chip and mayo ketchup â coming in a close second The vibe here is super casual think picnic tables â but the place does get full around lunchtime so prepare to eat on the go In the heart of Calle LoÃ za TresbÃ is a chic container turned restaurant where I like to stop if I have a bit of time and want to relax My go tos on the menu of light fare are fish tacos and the empanadillas similar to empanadas filled with beef fish chicken or cheese and onions If youâ re in the mood for a sit down meal I canâ t recommend Panuchos enough Its walls decorated with stenciled sugar skulls this Mexican restaurant serves up a Puerto Ricanâ Mexican fusion menu that combines the best of both traditions Accompanied by mashed malanga the tender churrasco arrachera skirt steak will fill both your belly and your soul And I never miss the chance to sip a coconut and sandÃ a margarita Fish tacos and other light fare draws diners to TresbÃ in a stylishly converted shipping container Steph Segarra for Lonely Planet Aperitivo In Puerto Rico having a beer or a drink after work is a regular ritual as coffee shops tend to close after the traditional break When Iâ m looking for craft cocktails and a stylish ambiance I usually head to Identidad Cocktail Bar in Santurce and order a Whiskey Coco made with coconut milk lime chai tea honey and cardamom The bar specializes in Caribbean cocktails â so Iâ d also recommend the creative â Sandia Sandia Sandia â concoction made with a black pepper tincture and watermelon If Iâ m looking for a more casual no frills drink before dinner Esquina Watusi is a standby Modeled after a neighborhood bar of the old school this is a place where you can sit outside listen to some salsa and drink an ice cold Medalla beer Visitors to San Juan will have a wide range of cuisine to chose from â as Chef Gerardo Davila of La Carreta Mercado Local can tell you Steph Segarra for Lonely Planet Dinner The high end dining scene in San Juan brims with options and you wonâ t have to look far to find unique farm to table restaurants serving elevated versions of classic Puerto Rican dishes One of the coolest such places at Casita Miramar the nighttime outpost for the historic lunch spot La Casita Blanca a few streets away If money isnâ t an object I recommend ordering the buÃ uelos â taro root and chorizo fritters â as an appetizer and the goat as a main course This take on a traditional stew from the mountains is made mouthwateringly with braised goat in red wine sauce with carrots and potatoes Since this spot is in high demand reserve online ahead I head to San Juan Smokehouse in La Placita de Santurce when I want to have smoked Southern style BBQ with Puerto Rican flair on a budget The relaxed atmosphere is excellent for a shareable plate of ribs Cuban pulled pork brisket and chicken The Moscow Mule made with homemade ginger beer is a great companion to all the smoky deliciousness For indulgent grilled ribs and pulled pork head to San Juan Smokehouse in the heart of Santurce Steph Segarra for Lonely Planet Bar San Juanâ s bar scene has solid options that range from super fancy to ultra laid back Whenever Iâ m in the mood for dancing I go to El Nie Bar which has an ample dance floor and live DJs and bands playing everything from reggaeton to Top pop hits If I want to dress up and sit down for a drink in a place with a speakeasy vibe La Disquera â a Japanese whiskey bar with a focus on original cocktails â on Calle Cerra is the place In the heart of La Placita Taberna Los VÃ squez is an excellent place to dance to some salsa played by live bands La Placita is also a great place to bar hop make sure to try the excellent drinks at the various kiosks in this lively zone If youâ re in the mood to hang out in Old San Juan El Batey is an excellent dive bar where you can get cheap drinks and craft cocktails â no fancy attire required Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For
