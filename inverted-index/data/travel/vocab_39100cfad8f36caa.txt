Italy s last wild steppe is seeing a renaissance TRAVEL Italy s last wild steppe is seeing a renaissance After decades of stagnation the Alta Murgia region an overlooked cultural gem is entering a new era of prosperity James Bond fans may recognize Gravina in Puglia a charming riverside town built on the edge of a ravine in the heart of Italy s Alta Murgia national park from s leap in No Time to Die The region s bid to draw in more visitors includes attracting film productions and restoring abandoned archaeology sites By Agostino Petroni Photographs by Alessandro Gandolfi Parallelozero October min read On a scorching summer afternoon Mariantonietta Scalera a year old shepherd opened the gates to her farm in Altamura a small town bordering Alta Murgia national park miles west of Bari the capital of southern Italy s Puglia region A hundred and fifty sheep and goats closely followed by seven mutts raced past her toward the grazing grounds sniffing for wild herbs and seeds Scalera inherited her father s passion for tending to animals and making artisanal cheese at a young age After spending a year in the Netherlands in for an agriculture exchange program she decided to return home and take over the family farm rather than continue working abroad like many of her friends When you go away you see home from another perspective Scalera said One of Italy s last remaining steppe landscapes Puglia s Alta Murgia encompasses municipalities each preserving little known historical cultural and culinary gems In Altamura nearly dinosaur footsteps cover the Pontrelli quarry The town is also where the Altamura Man a uniquely well preserved skeleton of a Neanderthal man who lived approximately years ago was found Visitors walk through the recently opened Pontrelli quarry in Altamura Italy The site features the largest collection of dinosaur footprints in Europe Karst sinkholes and ravines are natural features in Altamura Laterza and Gravina in Puglia which once hosted wayfarers traveling along the ancient Roman Appian Way Near the town of Andria the towering Castel del Monte is known as Alta Murgia s stone heart And regional chefs use locally foraged and harvested ingredients such as wild thistles cardoncelli mushrooms lampascioni small wild onions durum wheat almonds grapes and olives in their dishes Puglia produces almost percent of the olive oil in Italy In Naples what s years old is new again Yet Alta Murgia fell off the map as thousands of people abandoned the countryside to move to industrial cities looking for jobs and a better life Over several decades it became an illegal dumping ground for industrial waste an alcove for outlaws and the home to U S nuclear missile launch facilities in the But this obscure corner of Puglia is experiencing a renaissance Local volunteers returning young entrepreneurs like Scalera and city administrators are restoring areas previously covered in trash showcasing local culture and cuisine and opening archaeological sites once closed to the public The collective effort to turn Alta Murgia from coarse to charming can be seen in blockbuster movies like No Time to Die where international superspy James Bond drives across the Gravina bridge chased by villains and in runway shows for fashion houses such as Gucci set against the otherworldly octagonal castle Castel del Monte built by Emperor Frederik II in A D There is a desire for rebirth There is excitement Scalera said People are coming back While Puglia s Salento beaches and Gargano coast have recently become some of Italy s most traveled areas attracting millions of visitors including celebrities like Helen Mirren George Clooney and Madonna Alta Murgia remains true to its unique cultural and culinary traditions offering to those who venture into its inner routes the unexpected taste of a place lost in time A region reborn After decades of eluding tourists Alta Murgia and its surrounding communities began an extensive rehabilitation headed by nonprofit organizations local entrepreneurs and politicians Their efforts paid off in when the square mile flatlands became a national park Francesco Tarantini the park s president said this designation laid the groundwork for people like Scalera to return and invest in the land When bauxite extraction ended in the Bauxite Cave of Spinazzola became an illegal dumping ground for industrial textile scraps After years of locally organized cleanup the abandoned quarry opened this summer to the public As Tarantini and I walked around the edge of the feet deep Bauxite Cave of Spinazzola an abandoned bauxite quarry inside the park the cicadas din echoed along the vermillion hued cliffs Tarantini said that once the bauxite extraction ended in the the cave became an illegal dumping ground for industrial textile scraps The cleanup took years but the site reopened this summer to the public Aiming to bring more attention to the park Tarantini nominated Alta Murgia last November to become a UNESCO Global Geopark a protected place of geological significance to be managed sustainably Efforts to earn the designation include working with the regional towns to improve access and conservation of the park and creating multiday itineraries for visitors We are a geologist s paradise Tarantini said We want to share our heritage with the world This little known Italian paradise is more than meets the eye Nearby in Andria sits the crown jewel of the Alta Murgia region Castel del Monte a century octagonal fortress and designated UNESCO site that draws about visitors each year Elena Saponaro Castel del Monte s director since has been working to make the castle more interactive including implementing a digital project that shows visitors sections of the building that cannot be visited like the underground cisterns and the castle s hydraulic system The historical site also launched the HoloMuseum project in to allow visitors to discover the site with augmented reality Castel del Monte a century geometric fortress built by King Frederick II overlooks the small town of Andria in the Puglia region of Italy Built in an octagonal shape with each of the eight corners sporting an octagonal tower the castle was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in Storyteller Donato Laborante sits inside the crypt housing the Byzantine frescoes dedicated to Saint Michael the Archangel in Altamura s Masseria Jesce Built along the ancient Roman Appian Way the building was previously a monastery and a farm Castel del Monte possesses exceptional universal value for the perfection of its structure the harmony and the fusion of cultural elements from northern Europe the Muslim world and classical antiquity Saponaro said Thirty miles from Andria Francesco Mastromatteo a historian and tour guide for Terre di Murge Experience walked me through Gravina in Puglia s Gravina Sotterranea a labyrinth of underground tunnels cellars and aqueducts dug under the town out of solid rock We need slowness said Mastromatteo who welcomes innovative inclusive projects like FlyOn that allow people with disabilities to view the town through images captured by a flying drone We do not want to become Disneyland but we welcome a soft tourism Past and present intertwine The revival efforts of Alta Murgia can best be seen at the Masseria Jesce a century farmhouse on the outskirts of Altamura Once an ancient Roman Appian Way resting post the farmhouse features a century frescoed crypt dedicated to Saint Michael the Archangel It was bought by the municipality in the late partly refurbished but soon after abandoned A Roman era superhighway is disappearing Italy has a plan to save it Donato Laborante a year old storyteller takes care of Masseria Jesce with other volunteers Laborante keeps the place alive by hosting theater events and art exhibitions Currently the only way to visit this masseria farmhouse is to ring Laborante and hope he s available Davide Linzotti who manages the Lo Cuocio farm stay rides a horse in Gravina in Puglia near Alta Murgia national park Wearing a long peppery beard a white t shirt and washed out and patched blue pants Laborante walked me to the upper floor of the masseria He told me to wait in the first room as he sped ahead to open the next two doors one after the other letting the golden sunshine through Why do people fall in love with these places For the light said Laborante pointing at the far window facing the wild Murgia steppe These places allow you through silence to get closer to your essence Last year when I moved back to Alta Murgia from New York I thought I was looking for that part of myself I had left behind In my parents bought an century masseria at the north entrance of Alta Murgia national park They dreamed of turning the run down structure along with its surrounding acres of land into an olive grove alive with visitors After nearly a decade of renovations led by my parents the once dilapidated farmhouse now serves as the Biomasseria Lama di Luna a sustainable room boutique hotel featuring panoramic views over acres of organic olive and almond trees and grape vines Since my return I have joined my father in battling the many hurdles farmers and entrepreneurs must overcome to succeed in this harsh but beautiful terrain As I rode a light brown quarter horse following Antonella Urbano a horseback riding instructor who taught me how to ride when I was a kid I took in the sweet perfume of Alta Murgia s wild mint and violet orchids Cicadas serenaded the sun shying away in the distance behind Castel del Monte The first stars shone brightly in the vast and empty skies I felt a shiver of calmness I was home Agostino Petroni is a former Climate Science Pulitzer
