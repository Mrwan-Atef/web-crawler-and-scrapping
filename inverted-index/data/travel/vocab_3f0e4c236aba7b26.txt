protected as national parkland a bit of hustle and bustle has come to Cruz Bay the island s main town Accommodations range from world class luxury resorts to top notch vacation villas to back to basics campgrounds St John s heart is Virgin Islands National Park a treasure that takes up a full two thirds of St John s square miles square km The park was spearheaded by Laurance S Rockefeller and Frank Stick and was finally handed over to the Department of the Interior in The park helps keep the island s interior in its pristine and undisturbed state but if you go at midday you ll probably have to share your stretch of beach with others particularly at Trunk Bay The island is booming and it can get a tad crowded at the ever popular Trunk Bay Beach during the busy winter season parking woes plague the island s main town of Cruz Bay but you won t find traffic jams or pollution It s easy to escape from the fray just head off on a hike or go early or late to the beach The sun won t be as strong and you may have that perfect crescent of white sand all to yourself St John doesn t have a grand agrarian past like her sister island St Croix but if you re hiking in the dry season you can probably stumble upon the stone ruins of old plantations The less adventuresome can visit the repaired ruins at the park s Annaberg Plantation and Caneel Bay Resort In Jorgen Iverson claimed the unsettled island for Denmark By there were more than slaves working more than plantations In that year the island was hit by a drought hurricanes and a plague of insects that destroyed the summer crops With famine a real threat and the planters keeping them under tight rein the slaves revolted on November They captured the fort at Coral Bay took control of the island and held on to it for six months During this period about of the island s total population was killed the tragedy affecting both black and white residents in equal percentages The rebellion was eventually put down with the help of French troops from Martinique Slavery continued until when slaves in St Croix marched on Frederiksted to demand their freedom from the Danish government This time it was granted After emancipation St John fell into decline its inhabitants eking out a living on small farms Life continued in much the same way until the national park opened in and tourism became an industry Of the three U S Virgin Islands St John which has residents has the strongest sense of community which is primarily rooted in a desire to protect the island s natural beauty Despite the growth there are still many pockets of tranquility Here you can truly escape the pressures of modern life for a day a week perhaps forever Shopping Listings Restaurants Listings Sights Listings Hotels Listings
