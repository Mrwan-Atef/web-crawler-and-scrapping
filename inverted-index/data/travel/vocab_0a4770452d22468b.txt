roller coaster Big Bear Mountain which will be the park s longest at nearly feet around the Wildwood Grove section The new ride is now open to guests but Dolly herself won t be partaking â Yâ all know

featuring performances on horseback and aerial stunts accompanied by a four course meal It s far from your only option in this culinary subgenre though Down the road are Hatfield McCoy Dinner Feud Biblical Times Dinner Theater and Pirates Voyage Dinner Show For a quieter option head to Sevierville the Pigeon Forge adjacent town where Dolly attended high school and is now honored with a statue Gorge on lobster rolls and cornmeal fried okra at Pinchy s Lobster and Beer whose mission is to combine New England style seafood and Southern hospitality Where to drink near Dollywood Sevier County is technically dry but worry not There s a city option for liquor sales much to the relief of frazzled parents and recovering roller coaster riders all year round Beer is on tap at nearly all major restaurants though some of the dinner theaters are dry but for a truly unique pint head to Gatlinburg s Fox Parrot Tavern It s located along the eight mile loop of the Great Smoky Arts Crafts Community which features a wealth of craftsman shops including pottery blacksmithing and some delightfully quirky yard art The Fox Parrot offers a pub menu and traditional draft beers Finding a decent cocktail is a bit more of a challenge but you ll be in good hands at Seasons the upscale bistro located in Sevierville s historic Central Hotel Travel around Pigeon Forge on a tourist bus Â Getty
