Comfortable daytime temperatures between and to make the Bahamas a popular winter destination for North Americans fleeing snow ice and overcast conditions on the mainland Winter in the Bahamas also brings marine species like hammerhead and tiger sharks that makes the island nation doubly attractive to American and Canadian divers looking for a cure for cabin fever Book your visit several months

Visitors who choose to spend the holiday season in the Bahamas are rewarded with the start of the Junkanoo Winter Festival a world class celebration of culture Shoulder season is popular for spring break holidays and with families at all inclusive resorts Getty Images Shoulder season mid April to June is the best time to party If youâ re looking for a party shoulder season is the best time to pull up to a beachside bar and mingle Flocks of spring breakers descend on the Bahamas from stateside colleges each year in early spring Youâ ll even find a few family vacationers sprinkled in amongst the throngs especially at popular all inclusive retreats Be aware that Good Friday Easter Sunday and Easter Monday are national holidays in the Bahamas and many businesses may be closed Those seeking a more secluded escape can still take advantage of shoulder season deals during May and June when higher temperatures and a greater chance of rain start to slow the steady stream of tourists that arrive during the winter months Hotel discounts can plunge below off during shoulder season Visitors in June have a chance of rain and a chance of cloudy conditions however warm water and warm temperatures combine with lower prices to make June a viable travel option for many Diving in low season can be cheaper with a good chance to spot tiger sharks Stephen Frink Getty Images Low season

breaks in the weather offer excellent opportunities for budget minded divers who can still take advantage of low season deals While some might consider an increase in humidity and rain during low season to be a determent there really isnâ t a â worst timeâ to visit the Bahamas In fact low season offers budget conscious travelers some incredible reasons to bring a rain jacket Hotel rates can dip below from their peak highs This is the best time to pick up a last minute deal to the Bahamas Hurricane season is June to November Hurricane season in the Bahamas starts in June and runs through
