Need To Know Know Bogotá TRAVEL GUIDE GALLERY Introduction Intro Hotels Stay Things To Do Do Where To Eat Eat Need To Know Know The Fodor s Five The five things you need to know before traveling to Bogotá Don t underestimate the altitude Bogotá sits at meters feet above sea level which affects most people unless you re already accustomed to high altitude Stay hydrated and take it easy for the first couple of days You ll likely feel tired and maybe a little nauseous if you do anything too strenuous You ll also want to keep this in mind when packing Bring a jacket because despite being close to the equator Bogotá s high altitude means it can get quite cool at night But you ll also want to pack sunscreen the higher altitude means it s far easier to burn without realizing it especially on windy days Match your transport to the time of day There are endless ways to explore Bogotá and you ll want to choose each option carefully depending on the time of day The large size of the city means traffic can be awful during peak hours when cycling or walking is preferable Off peak the TransMilenio bus service is the easiest way to get around using a Tullave card For shorter distances look into the city s extensive network of bike lanes called Ciclorutas Bogotá is surrounded by mountains and these regions are covered by cable cars with incredible views over the city during sunset At night just call a taxi via an app like Tappsi and EasyTaxi Explore the most varied food scene in Colombia While it has a growing number of fine dining options Bogotá s street food and casual dining scene has plenty to offer too Don t miss out on trying ajiaco a traditional Andean soup made with chicken potatoes corn and a local herb called guascas Buy fresh arepas from street vendors and visit the local fruit markets to taste feijoa and lulo The bakery scene in Bogotá is well worth a try too you ll find plenty of pastry and cheese varieties at La Puerta Falsa the city s oldest restaurant or sweet and savory offerings throughout the city For all of the above you ll want to bring cash and ideally small change Keep your wits about you Colombians have a saying no dar papaya don t give away your papaya and means don t put yourself in dangerous situations unnecessarily Like any big city Bogotá has safe areas and not so safe areas Keep expensive belongings away and don t flash your phone or cash If you re heading out at night stick to well lit areas and call a taxi via an app rather than hailing one on the street Tappsi and EasyTaxi are two common options here as well as Uber although keep in mind that drivers will almost always ask you to sit in the front seat It s perfectly safe and normal to do so Learn the ropes of the local drinks Unlike elsewhere in Latin America a tinto in Colombia is a coffee not a wine You ll see sellers on most street corners pushing carts and serving up coffee served with sugar and vanilla Another one you ll likely be offered mostly on social occasions or at clubs is aguadiente a locally brewed spirit made from sugarcane and infused with anise You ll come across aguadiente in a few different forms but generally expect a bad hangover Its name translates to burning water which tells you all you need to know about its effectiveness Read More Recommended Fodor s Video FODOR S FINEST The Best Hotels in South America Four Seasons Hotel
