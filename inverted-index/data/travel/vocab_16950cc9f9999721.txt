How Laax in Switzerland brings a California surfer vibe to the slopes TRAVEL This Swiss ski resort brings a California surfer vibe to the slopes Laax s revamped Freestyle Academy sees skiers flocking to the eco conscious Swiss resort that s defined by a laid back Californian vibe Laax has been crowned the world s best freestyle resort by the World Ski Awards for eight consecutive years Photography by LAAX By Berkok Yüksel November This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK It s my final day in Laax and I m standing at the edge of the world s biggest half pipe The Beast as it s aptly named stretches for metres and is seven metres deep a daunting sight for many and certainly for this intermediate skier venturing into my first half pipe Snowboarders effortlessly slalom past me defying gravity with each jump landing with finesse on the compacted snow with a mischievous grin on their faces Two days earlier after a scenic train journey from Zurich to Chur followed by a bus ride up winding mountain roads I d expected to find the archetypal Swiss ski resort populated with wealthy retirees gliding about the slopes and glitzy chalet restaurants filled with patrons in fashion statement skiwear Instead I was greeted by young snowboarders whizzing from ski lifts to terrace bars Burton clad staff watching freestyle highlights on YouTube and a lively vibe closer to a Berlin hostel than a Swiss chalet Laax is mostly visited by people in their explains our guide Martina Calonder a local of the same age and third generation ski instructor In most ski resorts in Switzerland it s above Part of the Flims Falera Laax ski area Laax is managed entirely by a single company Weisse Arena Gruppe connected by a network of ski lifts Most of its miles of piste are above host to a variety of winter sports for different levels and styles But among them freestyling is what makes Laax so uniquely attractive to younger skiers Crowned the world s best freestyle resort by the World Ski Awards for eight consecutive years Laax draws in hordes of boarders and skiers from November to April Its world class freestyle offerings include the infamous half pipe and a more manageable mini pipe Beyond these there are five snowparks peppered with countless rails kickers hips and other obstacles that dance the line between thrill and risk Laax ski resort champions Greenstyle a sustainability initiative aiming to set the standard for eco friendly skiing with practices like on demand gondolas and ski lifts powered by renewable energy Photograph by Nikolay Korzhov

more of a challenge can then ski down to Ils Plaun an intermediate zone or the pro level NoName zone home to the aforementioned Beast And here in Laax skiers and boarders speak of these snow parks less like slopes and more like must see Disneyland attractions But Laax is more than just a winter sports playground The resort s legendary Freestyle Academy founded in reopens after a two year revamp this season Now having almost doubled in size this metre state of the art underground complex houses a skate bowl parkour zone with jump tower and airbag half pipes ramps and freestyle trampolines with cameras to allow for video analysis of jumps catering to indoor thrill seekers of all ages year round Meanwhile Flims Forest is a short bus ride away woven with hiking and biking trails and horse drawn carriage rides lead to the shores of Lake Cauma or the breathtaking vistas of the Rhine Gorge often referred to as the Swiss Grand Canyon On my first evening I trek up from Laax base station through flurries of snow from cannons hard at work covering the piste to Tegia Larnags a cosy mountain hut turned restaurant known for its hearty Swiss cuisine Our table is soon filled with crisp röstis perfectly grilled veal livers and steaming pots of fondue Swiss dining at its finest The next day however I find myself at Riders Hotel s restaurant at Laax base where the menu takes an unexpected turn We offer a fully vegetarian menu year round explains Pascal Bertschinger the year old chef Swiss mountain cuisine is typically traditional and meat heavy but it doesn t have to be Here the menu combines local ingredients with inventive twists such as traditional spaetzli noodles smothered in a lip smacking black garlic sauce Designed in minimalist Scandi style with warm wood finishes Riders Hotel s lobby bar simply named The Lobby draws a hipster crowd often seen sporting beanies and Vans year round Photograph by Laax The natural next stop is Riders Hotel lobby for some select après Sipping a negroni at the bar I could easily mistake it for a laid back Copenhagen cocktail spot Designed in minimalist Scandi style with warm wood finishes the bar simply named The Lobby draws a hipster crowd often seen sporting beanies and Vans year round Perhaps it s the hotel s dual role as a cultural hub and event space hosting weekly film nights as well as concerts and serving as the go to after party venue during the Laax Open freestyle competition in January The freestyling laid back charm that defines Laax was very much the vision of its founder Reto Gurtner chairman of Weisse Arena Gruppe Laax was born out of the time I spent in California I wanted to bring the culture around surfing and the community feeling to the mountains here says the year old local legend When I meet him at Riders Hotel he s wearing his iconic flat cap with a long brim under which sits a bushy moustache and goatee He speaks passionately about LAAX and its aim to become a leading eco conscious resort The goal is to be zero carbon by he says Dubbed Greenstyle by the team behind the long term strategy sustainability efforts in Laax so far are pioneering All ski lifts are powered by renewable electricity and the new FlemExpress gondola functions on demand to avoid unnecessary runs while piste grooming vehicles run on hybrid power and are digitally optimised Riders Restaurant even features smart cameras atop bins analysing waste People who come here are very happy about the green efforts says Martina as we head out for my final runs But it s still not the main reason people choose their ski destinations And she s right While it s great to know the ski lift we re on is solar powered my eyes are firmly fixed on the half pipe and the people elegantly slaloming below We exit the lift for a pit stop at Caffè NoName overlooking the slopes where I down a half pint of liquid courage and take my place at the edge of The Beast Before the boozy bravado can fade away I push off quickly my weight swiftly carrying me down the Beast s curved wall My heart pounds faster than my skis rattling over the snow Within seconds that feel like centuries velocity finally propels me into the air like a child lifted by their parent The warm sun is on my face the breeze momentarily stops I m airborne Then the rush of air returns as I fall back into the pipe s curve finally crumpling and rolling on the snow It feels like catching a wave Reto was right This is a slice of California life the closest thing to surfing you can experience on a mountain How to do it Swissair has direct flights from London to Zurich which is just over an hour by train from Chur From there it s a minute bus ride to Laax A two night stay at Riders Hotel costs from per person B B More info flimslaax com
