how to get upright in the water how to change direction and how to ride up as well as downwind Most beginner courses offer three half days of tuition and should leave you safety conscious and more or less independent as well as fizzing with excitement at the sense of speed and power Who Body builder biceps aren t needed as the harness takes most of the strain More important is a cool head and above average swimming ability While a wetsuit and buoyancy vest will be provided and there s always a safety boat on duty there will be a fair amount of bobbing about in the water on your own How

Swimtrek Coasteering Where Coasteering is said to have been invented in the Welsh city of St David s in and Pembrokeshire s western tip is still one of the best places to try this thrilling athletic pursuit Not only do its cliffs coves and half submerged boulders provide the perfect coastal obstacle course but they also wrap round three sides of the peninsula so there will always be a spot that s exposed or sheltered enough to suit any ability level no matter the conditions When Warmer water and calmer seas make summer best for beginners What Coasteering is a thrilling combination of hiking climbing swimming and rock jumping exploring the line that separates land and sea through caves and channels and over rocky wave beaten outcrops This is a landscape usually reserved for shipwrecks and seagulls so you ll need to be properly equipped and led by expert guides Thick wetsuits life jackets helmets and a pair of old trainers provide the required warmth and buoyancy as well as protection against scrapes and bumps Who Children need to be big enough to fit their wetsuits while adults need to be agile enough to haul themselves out of surging seawater onto rocky ledges How A four hour

and transfers as well as sailing equipment and tuition Structured RYA beginner s courses cost per person extra Dinghy sailing in Greece Photograph by Mark Warner Skimboarding Where Anywhere in the world that has a gently shelving sandy beach that s free of rocks When Long summer days What Skimboarding is one of the most accessible beachside activities for anyone willing to give it a try The boards themselves are usually made from wood or fibreglass covered foam shaped like a teardrop and a few centimetres thick Throw it flat on a skein of sea water at the water s edge jump on board and suddenly you re skimming over almost nothing Mistakes are often punished by painful public pratfalls but focus on flat water not waves and soon you ll be having all the fun in the world Who Young children will be most excited but anyone who doesn t mind falling over can give it a go How Beginner skimboards cost as little as but provide hours of splashy fun Paddleboarding Where It s much easier to learn without the fear of falling into freezing water A good wetsuit will help or you could head to Croatia where the water temperature hovers around a balmy around the sun drenched islands of the Zadar peninsula in summer When Early September when the crowds of speedboats and mega yachts have thinned out What Like surfing paddleboarding is another beautifully simple sport It s just you the board and your paddle You ll need to concentrate and work your stomach muscles to stay upright but it s the inherent tippiness of the sport that makes successful paddleboarding such an ego boost Who Confident swimmers will enjoy it most as well as those with some experience with canoes and kayaks How Malik Adventures offers guided paddleboard tours of the Zadar peninsula starting from per person B B for six nights staying in a family run B B on Molat and including all the necessary equipment but not travel to Molat While paddleboarding is relatively friendly to newcomers experienced swimmers

paddling paradise The wildlife is truly exciting with a might see list that includes orca humpback and minke whales dolphins bald eagles black bears and sea otters When Most tours run from June to

serious paddling starts Expect four to six hours of paddling a day with wind strength and weather varying the tempo How Spirit of the West Adventures offers a five night Johnstone Strait Expedition at per person full board and including camping and kayaking equipment but not travel to and from the Alder Bay start point Sea kayaking is one of the best ways to experience the coast from a completely

aspirant wing foilers Its sheltered waters consistent cross shore winds and complete lack of distractions make it the perfect spot to muscle through the difficult early days of learning When Between March and October What Wingfoiling was born as an offshoot of windsurfing swapping out the big sail for an aerodynamic wing based on the shape of a flying fish It may seem daunting at first coordinating the hand held wing with a fiendish little board underfoot But when they work together the board s underwater foil generates lift and pushes you up clean out of the ocean Who While many people say that wing foiling is more accessible than kitesurfing you ll still need to be fit flexible and light on your feet How Seven nights full board at the Lagon Energy Dakhla resort starts from including flights and transfers and six hours of private tuition Surfing Where It might be worth setting aside your daydreams of barrelling South Pacific waves and laid back Indonesian surf camps when

bubbly surge of already broken waves If you re light on your feet and a have a good sense of balance you could find getting upright easy enough while most first timers will take at least a few days to
