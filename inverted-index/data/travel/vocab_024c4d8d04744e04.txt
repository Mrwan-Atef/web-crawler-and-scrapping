Teatro Nacional San José Costa Rica Attractions Lonely Planet Lonely Planet Destinations Planning Inspiration Shop Search Saves Open main menu Shutterstock Teatro Nacional San José Costa Rica Central America Top choice in San José Login Save On the southern side of the Plaza de la Cultura resides the Teatro Nacional San José s most revered building Constructed in it features a columned neoclassical facade flanked by statues of Beethoven and famous century Spanish dramatist Calderón de la Barca The lavish marble lobby and auditorium are lined with paintings depicting various facets of century life History When construction began in the late century the President of Costa Rica was determined to create a lavish and impressive building that was worthy of the moniker National Theater However the population of Costa Rica was quite low San Jose alone had only around residents and cost was a major consideration President José Joaquín Rodríguez Zeledón s solution to this problem was to place a tax on coffee the main export of the country at the time The construction was fraught with problems until an Italian engineer was brought in to oversee the entire project and guide it to success The theater s most famous painting is Alegoría al café y el banano an idyllic canvas showing coffee and banana harvests The painting was produced in Italy and shipped to Costa Rica for installation in the theater and the image was reproduced on the old note now out of circulation It seems clear that the painter never witnessed a banana harvest because of the way the man in the center is awkwardly grasping a bunch actual banana workers hoist the stems onto their shoulders Square in front of the famous National Theater of Costa Rica in San Jose at night Mihai Bogdan Lazar
