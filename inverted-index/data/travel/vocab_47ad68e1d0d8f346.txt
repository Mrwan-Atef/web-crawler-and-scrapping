entertainment district Gion where geiko Kyoto s geisha still perform The over tall tree whose blossom fringed branches arch gracefully almost to the ground is illuminated in the evening from dusk until midnight Oh and there are some other cherry trees in the park so you can bet on lots of picnics taking place here Come early to grab a good spot And later on take a stroll along the nearby canal the Shirakawa lined with cherry trees and also lit up at night Best time to go to Maruyama kÅ en for cherry blossoms Catch the blooms in early April Hirosaki kÅ en is so vast that you can enjoy the blooms without the crowds Shutterstock Hirosaki kÅ en in TÅ hoku is less crowded Hirosaki kÅ en Hirosaki Park is a huge green space nearly hectares covering the grounds of what used to be the castle Hirosaki jÅ All that remains of the actual castle is a year old keep but the park is marbled with the old moats which are now flanked by sakura and crisscrossed with photogenic arching bridges There are over cherry trees here and given that Hirosaki way up north in Aomori Prefecture is not the population center that Tokyo or even Kyoto is you can expect a bit more room to move around Rent a paddle boat to take out on the moats which are invariably covered in pink petals Best time to go to Hirosaki kÅ en for cherry blossoms Head here in late April to early May to see the sakura in bloom Iconic shot of the cherry blossoms at Churei tÅ Pagoda lkunl Getty Images Fuji Five Lakes in Yamanashi offers the best cherry blossom photo opportunities The view from the Churei tÅ Pagoda in Fuji

picnics under the cherry blossom Like Kyoto Tokyo has many popular cherry blossom spots While it s not the most historic that would be Ueno kÅ en or the most picturesque that would be Shinjuku gyoen we re doubling down on Yoyogi kÅ en Yoyogi Park because it is just the most fun It s a huge sprawling park with tufty grass and plenty of cherry trees with room for everyone and yet it still becomes a sea of party people growing more and more unsteady as the day gives way to night We ve seen barbecues here turntables and portable karaoke machines more selfie sticks than we care to count and the odd guy in nothing but his shorts The only thing Yoyogi kÅ en is short on is public toilets prepare to wait in line Best time to go to Yoyogi kÅ en for cherry blossoms Join the parties under the blossoms
