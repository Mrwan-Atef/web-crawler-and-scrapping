A look at Charleston s pioneering new museum on African American heritage Drayton Hall an unrestored century plantation estate in Charleston is open to the public Photograph by Alamy TRAVEL HISTORY A look at Charleston s pioneering new museum on African American heritage A game changing new Charleston museum aims to tackle the Southern Belle s controversial past By Jonathan Thompson February min read This article was adapted from National Geographic Traveller UK The first thing I notice as I arrive at the International African American Museum is the Wall of Departure At first impression it s a straightforward ship s manifest of names and ages but that s far from the reality This is a human shopping list a rundown of African slaves about to cross the Atlantic in barbaric conditions for a life in bondage Across the atrium the Wall of Arrival tells a different story Those lucky enough to survive the horrors of the six week voyage to Charleston were rechristened with condescending nicknames such as Friday or Big Sam Their true identities like their freedom were now an ocean away In its early century heyday Charleston was one of the most prolific slaving ports in North America So it s fitting this long awaited museum opening this year will be here squatting sleek and spaceship like on pillars above Gadsden s Wharf where tens of thousands of slaves first arrived in the New World As well as taking an unflinching look at slavery in the US the museum celebrates the African American experience as a whole from emancipation to the civil rights movement and beyond Committed reckoning with history is a necessary step on the road to healing and reconciliation says Dr Tonya Matthews the museum s CEO as we tour the space Charleston is a port city a global city and a historic city There s no better place for our museum to steward these stories that have such national and international significance The museum itself is a triumph a dream that took years to become reality Across nine separate light filled galleries it dissects everything from the impact of Africans on the US to the Great Migration of the century with state of the art interactive installations adding thought provoking depth and humanity throughout A horse drawn carriage tour passes through Downtown Charleston Photograph by Alamy One of the most affecting exhibits is Memories of the Enslaved a soundproofed room holding audible first person accounts of slavery recorded in the Meanwhile the Center for Family History is a genealogy library where academics are on hand to help African Americans trace their family trees millions of which will be intertwined with the chains of Gadsden s Wharf I like to describe the museum as a space of courageous curiosity says Dr Matthews There s so much history here so many untold stories That s what we re trying to delve into to better understand not just where so many of us came from but also where we re going The museum is the latest high profile move for a city determined to reckon with its painful past In the Confederate flag still an incredibly divisive symbol of the Old South was removed from the South Carolina statehouse while in Charleston City Council formally apologised for its role in the slave trade The IAAM is an important part of that process but it also fits into the city s burgeoning cultural scene It will join an impressive assortment of museums including the Gibbes Museum of Art which underwent a multimillion dollar renovation and reopened in and the year old Charleston Museum which has an enormous collection of historical artifacts And that s not forgetting Fort Sumter a century sea fort in Charleston Harbour where the first shots were fired in the American Civil War and the path to emancipation began in earnest The modern city itself with its incredible architecture buoyant restaurant scene and lively nightlife is centred on a thumb like peninsula jutting out into the harbour It s a treasure chest of cobblestone streets rainbow coloured townhouses bristling church spires and stylish boutique hotels Despite its relatively small population of some people it has more than enough to keep the most demanding travellers occupied for a week or more particularly if they venture out to explore the garland of golden beaches surrounding the city Founded in Charleston is one of the oldest cities in the US and has a deep history Facing the dark side of this head on cements Charleston as not only the most charming city in the South but one of its most convincing and cultured How to do it Airlines
