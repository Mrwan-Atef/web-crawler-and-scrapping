escarpments plunging headlong into the sparkling Mediterranean the Golfo di Orosei is one of the most dramatic coastal destinations in all of Europe The meeting of land and sea here is so abrupt that the gulfâ s best beaches such as Camontla Mariolu are accessible only by boat or on foot The most straightforward way to explore this stretch of coast is on a boat tour from the holiday resort of Cala

to visit one set your sights on Su Nuraxi di Barumini also know as Nuraghe Su Nuraxi about an hour north of Cagliari The four conical towers that once dominated the landscape have been worn down by time but itâ s easy to conjure up visions of the Bronze Age village that once stood here as you clamber down stone steps and navigate narrow passageways The siteâ s centerpiece is an imposing high higth tower fragment surrounded by a circular courtyard with walls up to thick Planning tip To discover Sardiniaâ s thousands of other nuraghi explore the map at Nurnet Channel Algheroâ s romantic

for panoramic views of the cobbled streets and Gothic palazzi of the historic center backed by the shimmering waters of the Riviera del Corallo To fully appreciate Algheroâ s easygoing vibe take an early evening stroll along its sea walls framed by a trio of picturesque towers and lined with open air restaurant terraces At sunset itâ s the perfect spot to watch the world go by over a bottle of vermentino and a plate of aragosta alla catalana lobster with olive oil tomatoes onions and lemon juice Take a dip at one of the remote beaches in the La Maddalena Archipelago National Park Francesco

sheepskins and cowbells parade through town If you miss the main event Mamoiadaâ s Museo delle Maschere Mediterranee is the next best thing with fabulous displays of masks costumes and video footage The nearby village of Orgosolo is another fascinating place to explore Grab a multilingual audio guide at the tourist office and head for Corso Repubblica to explore Orgosoloâ s vivid collection of street murals which depict a range of political and historical themes Planning tip Fall is another wonderful time to visit Barbagia During the Autunno in Barbagia festival September to December the

between sheer polychrome cliffs Equally evocative is the nearby hike to the prehistoric village of Tiscali whose stone walls and ruined edifices lie in the collapsed remains of a massive cave Fans of remote beaches should switchback up to the Altopiano del Golgo north of Baunei to hike the Cala GoloritzÃ trail which drops dramatically to a pristine cove presided over by a dagger shaped rock
