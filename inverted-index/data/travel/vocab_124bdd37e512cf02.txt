hikers can step into the backcountry on the Cruiser Lake Trail This remote eight mile path on the Kabetogama Peninsula is accessible only by boat or canoe typically from the Ash River Visitor Center

reserved through the park that are stationed here under a combination lock they can t be portaged elsewhere Where to find the best spots for seeing wildlife While there are at least three wolf packs living within park boundaries with many others in the Greater Voyageurs Ecosystem wildlife biologist Thomas Gable says it s rare to see a gray wolf in the park As the project lead of the Voyageurs Wolf Project he s studied wolves in some of the most remote corners of the park but typically sees them only on trail cameras However you might hear them in areas like the Kabetogama Peninsula Many other animals can be seen throughout the park even from viewpoints Gable recommends beaver ponds such as the Beaver Pond Overlook because they attract other wildlife including waterfowl minks muskrats

like yellow perch and smallmouth bass To do so guests must obtain a State of Minnesota fishing license Numerous guiding services take visitors out on the park s lakes The Black Bay Trail system is a
