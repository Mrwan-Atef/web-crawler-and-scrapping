What it s like to go surfing in Busan South Korea Lee Eun seo and Philip Ahn are instructors at Surf Holic one of the many surf schools on the east coast of Busan Photograph by Ben Weller TRAVEL The booming surf destination you ve never heard of Skyscrapers meet the sea in South Korea s second largest city And as the home of the first surf schools in the country it s an ideal destination to learn to ride the waves By Ben Lerwill October This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK It s a warm spring morning the frothy waves are washing rhythmically against the shore and Songjeong Beach is soaked in sunshine Standing in a wetsuit at the water s edge Lee Eun seo balls up one fist and then extends her thumb and little finger brandishing the result high in the air The shaka sign she says with a smile If you see me doing this it means you re surfing well Here on the eastern outskirts of Busan on the southeastern tip of South Korea you could be forgiven for thinking you were nowhere near a city Green hills ring the bay surf schools line the seafront and joggers are out on the blonde sands Songjeong is barely two miles from the sky high towers of the crowded Haeundae District but it feels more like a small seaside resort than part of South Korea s second biggest urban centre with a population approaching million When you see Busan on a map you get a proper sense of how much coastline it has The sea is rarely far away with seven public beaches from lively Gwangalli where locals walk innumerable pet pomeranians by the twinkling lights of Gwangan Bridge to Songjeong where the country s first surf school was founded We hear a lot about the Korean wave the phenomenon also known as Hallyu which swept the country s modern culture across the world But this seaside city might just be the best place to experience the real thing And that s what I m here to do Lee Eun seo is one of the instructors at Surf Holic alongside her bleach haired colleague Philip Ahn She s talking myself and another beginner a quiet middle aged woman on her second lesson through the basics of catching a swell Lee Eun seo wears her hair in a loose bun laughs freely and has a way of making surfing sound like child s play Think of this as a shark she says with a grin patting a surfboard Here s the nose here s the tail here s the fin Simple Surf schools such as Surf Holic line the eastern outskirts of Busan Photograph by Ben Weller She has after all been doing this for a long time having learned to surf when she was just I loved it from the first day I used to do powerlifting too but when I started high school I had to give both hobbies up because there was so much studying to do She turns to look at the sea and her eyes light up I started surfing again when I was and I m never stopping again Korea s surfing scene is still a growing one with the sport only having been introduced in the by local students returning from Australia and the US Since then clubs and schools have multiplied In the country welcomed Wave Park Asia s largest surf centre which creates artificial waves in a lagoon near Seoul But the biggest surf scene remains here in the sport s Korean birthplace with its consistent waves and wide beaches It s for this reason that Busan has become the natural place to pull on a wetsuit for locals and visitors alike The city has long had a reputation for welcoming newcomers and outside influences Despite the area s long history much of the city s population has roots here dating back less than a century In at the start of the Korean War between what would ultimately become North and South Korea northern troops forced the armies of the south to retreat into a small pocket of land around Busan which was then a port settlement of some people By August of that year it was serving as the temporary wartime capital of the south When the conflict ended in more than a million refugees had poured into the city Some of them settled in Gamcheon Culture Village a port neighbourhood of brightly painted hillside dwellings It s since been reinvented into a laid back community of arty laneways terrace cafes and K pop murals There s also one unusual postbox file a stamped card through its slot and it won t be sent for a full year offering the chance to receive postcards from your past self Given the history of the spot it s an especially fitting souvenir A balancing act Remaining on the sand we begin to practise leaping onto our boards pushing ourselves up from our stomachs to a standing crouch Lee Eun seo goes off to find a replacement leash needed to keep my surfboard attached to my ankle should I go one way and my board another I get chatting to my fellow learner who has already perfected the pop up jump She s from the inland city of Daegu and has made the trip here specifically for a few days of surfing Philip Ahn an instructor at Surf Holic has been surfing since she was and now teaches at the Surf Holic school Photograph by Ben Weller Once I ve refined the art of jumping onto the board on dry land we venture into the sea The previous morning I d opened the curtains of my room at the Seacloud Hotel above Haeundae Beach and seen around surfers out in the heavy pre breakfast waves bobbing around in the swell like neoprene wrapped seals Today the conditions at Songjeong are calmer the waves more frisky ponies than white horses For a novice like me it s ideal After an initial jolt from its brisk temperature I find the water cool and enveloping The ridged sand is soft under my toes Thirty yards out I look back at the buildings on shore which already seem distant and muted like they re part of another world My classmate is in position belly down on her board and Lee Eun seo is gesturing at the waves and giving me a thumbs up It s time to ride It takes me less than five minutes to learn that the sport requires patience Choosing the right kind of wave not too small not too frothy is half of what makes a good surfer Getting up into a standing position is even trickier On my first attempt I lean too far forward and nose dive on my second I lean too far back and slip off and on my third I end up with a mouthful of South Korea s finest salt water Stand up a bit more slowly Lee Eun seo shouts over the thumps of the waves Whenever I fall in she lets loose a raucous laugh Every so often a larger wave appears The first time I get over excited and paddle out to meet it too quickly missing the momentum of the swell Then when I m least expecting it I feel my board being lifted beneath me and for a moment I m being carried by the sea I get to my feet wobble and stand my arms outstretched The beach is somewhere in front of me but I m oblivious to everything other than the sensation of flying I hear Lee Eun seo whooping When I reach the shallows and look back she s grinning broadly making the shaka sign This story was created with the support of InsideAsia Published in the November
