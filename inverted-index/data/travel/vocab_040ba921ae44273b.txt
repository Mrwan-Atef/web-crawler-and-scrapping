read Share Plan your train travels with this guide to the international Eurostar service Â Eurostar Itâ s been years since the Eurostar first connected London to mainland Europe via the Channel Tunnel As an Australian living in London I cannot tell you how excited I was the first time I arrived at St Pancras â Internationalâ to board a Paris bound train A few trips later including a recent long weekend in Amsterdam with my kid to celebrate a milestone birthday I have put together a first timerâ s guide to riding the Eurostar Hereâ s everything you need to know if youâ re traveling the Eurostar on a Standard class ticket And if you want to grab a bargain sign up for emails to be the first to know when the cheap tickets drop The Eurostar has direct services linking London Lille Paris Brussels Rotterdam and Amsterdam Â Eurostar br What are the railway stations served by Eurostar In London itâ s St Pancras International which is right next to Kingâ s Cross Station Thereâ s plenty of public transportation and dozens of places to eat and drink before you board whether inside the train station or nearby at Coal Drops Yard north of the station Heading south over beyond Euston Rd the area has a slight ghost town feel after dark In Paris the train departs from Gare du Nord which is located in the arrondissement Queues to buy tickets for onward travel on the metro are notoriously long but you can buy tickets on the Eurostar Be aware itâ s also a prime target for pickpockets and scam artists Donâ t be distracted or like me you may lose a handbag while being asked a seemingly genuine question by a stranger Advertisement When catching the Eurostar from Amsterdam Centraal youâ ll find the outbound platform is tucked away Although in the station is having an upgrade so watch this space Stock up on provisions before you go through passport control The area around the station is busy so take normal precautions including looking out for trams and cyclists who have right of way no matter what At Brussels Midi Station you may notice a police presence due to heightened security in Europe The station area is fairly safe but it can feel less so after dark with fewer people around For Lille Antwerp and Rotterdam both smaller cities the stations where the Eurostar alights are located in the city center with shops cafes and sights nearby Public transport is easy to navigate but these are also very walkable cities if you re not carrying a lot of luggage Read more about the London Amsterdam Rotterdam route here First time visiting France Hereâ s what you should know There are no weight limits for luggage on the Eurostar but you do need to lift it onto the train and rack yourself Â Tasmin Waby Lonely Planet What can I take on the Eurostar You can take two bags up to at their widest longest point plus one piece of hand luggage on the Eurostar Thereâ s no weight limit but you do need to be able to lift your bags onto the train and potentially up to the rack above your seat There is luggage storage space at the end of each coach for stowing larger items Eurostar does assist you with up to two items of luggage but only if the weight is below and the length doesnâ t exceed Keep in mind that the maximum weight accepted on the trains is You should also book a dedicated space for excess and oversized baggage beforehand via Eurostar Travel Services Itâ s best to have your luggage within sight at all times As we passed through Brussels on our way to Amsterdam announcements were made to keep an eye on your belongings as thieves have been known to lighten the trainâ s load The best bit of traveling by a high speed train compared to flying there are no restrictions on liquids You can take all the products and bottled water you like note that there is nowhere to refill on board And if youâ re up for a tipple you can take one bottle of wine or bubbly or four cans of beer on board â except for during some major events but youâ ll get notified if thatâ s the case What else should I bring on the Eurostar There are UK and European plug sockets to recharge phones and laptops although there are no USB sockets with Standard class seats BYO book or download content to your devices in advance as the wi fi and phone signal drops out regularly Bring food with you buy something in the cafe carriage in Standard class or have a meal brought to you in Premium class Â Eurostar Can I buy food onboard the Eurostar There is a cafe carriage selling snacks and light meals for Standard class travelers Premium classes get a meal delivered to their seats like on a plane The Eurostar menu changes twice a year but the options are limited so itâ s often better to bring your own food especially if you have dietary restrictions A three course meal is nowhere to be found here Buy your train supplies before you pass through passport control as the options inside the terminal at London St Pancras International were very busy the morning we traveled while at Paris and Amsterdam theyâ re virtually non existent What canâ t I take with me on the Eurostar Thereâ s a list of things you cannot take on the Eurostar on the website most of which follow common sense firearms flammables illegal drugsâ Perishable items like meat fish and dairy are also on the list but I am sure I could smell some scrumptious Dutch cheese in somebodyâ s bag on our way home Advertisement Sadly taking a bike with you is a lot harder than one would hope given the increase in interest in cycling to get around and cycling holidays in Europe For full sized bikes you need to pre book passage and disassemble your bike to check it in as luggage Folding bikes and childrenâ s bikes can be brought on board with you but they need to be in a protective bag Do I need to print my Eurostar tickets Print your ticket out if you want a paper backup but you can scan tickets directly from the Eurostar app at the arrival gates If your seat has changed for whatever reason a fresh paper ticket will be printed for you at the gate Next you move onto border control via security like you do at an international airport Do I need a visa as well as my passport Make sure you are up to date on what documents you need for European travel which varies by nationality Citizens of Schengen member countries can enter France with only a passport or national ID card UK is not a member of the Schengen area so you might need a visa to enter its territory Check if you need a visa to the UK beforehand to avoid any complications As well as your passport from late biometric information a face scan or fingerprints will be collected at European borders which is expected to slow down the check in process and may have a knock on effect on the number of passengers that can be booked and processed per train Also note that from all non EU citizens that includes the British obviously will need an ETIAS European Travel Information and Authorisation System â a â visa waiver scheme like the US ESTA â to enter Europe Wondering about your visa situation We have guidance for France the UK and Belgium What are the check in and boarding procedures for Eurostar Eurostar is an international train that crosses the EU border That makes check in here a bit different from your regular national hop and ride rail travel Each station served by Eurostar has a departure area where passport checks and customs are done Be prepared to queue During the weekends and holidays standing in line to check in can take longer When we traveled on Eurostar from London to Paris it took us roughly minutes to get through all the checks before finally taking a seat on the train But I had an early morning journey on Tuesday so the queues werenâ t there If youâ re traveling during weekends or holidays itâ s better to come earlier to avoid missing your train Be aware that the gate closes minutes before departure Once you pass through security thereâ s a waiting area with free wi fi and several cafes Premier ticket holders can use the business lounge in London Paris and Brussels Do you really need to get there minutes before your Eurostar train departs Yes you really do Cutting it fine can work out but there are sometimes multiple trains from St Pancras so queues can build quickly Also seating inside terminals is limited so do yourself a favor and get there on time What happens if I miss my train This has happened to me or should I say yes I did this to myself and Eurostar kindly rebooked our group on the next service headed to Paris However thereâ s a hefty â rebooking fee for missing your train and hopping on the next one the same day Also Eurostar only rebooks a new ticket for you without the seat reservation We found ourselves in the backward facing seats with no window views on the later train Luckily the cafe carriage has large windows so we congregated there for most of the journey Seats are allocated when you book your ticket but you can change these online or through the app Â Tasmin Waby Lonely Planet What are the ticket pricing options and classes available on Eurostar Eurostar is changing its travel classes starting on November The previous Standard Standard Premier and Business Premier will become Eurostar Standard Eurostar Plus and Eurostar Premier respectively Check out the updated travel conditions for every class on Eurostar s official website The best way to score the cheapest fare is to book in advance The Eurostar prices start at â for Standard â for Plus and â for Premier Each travel class comes with different degrees of flexibility and refundability so choose the one that works best for you The most cost effective way is to book online as the tickets bought at the station incur an additional â fee As a person who changes plans all the time I like that Eurostar allows the free change of ticket up to one hour before the trip on both Standard and Plus classes Sure you have to pay the price difference if your next ticket is more expensive but it gives you extra freedom that canâ t be found in air travel The refund is possible too for a â fee Just do it up to days before your departure date How do you choose seats Youâ ll be allocated seats at the time of booking but you can change these online or via the app I recommend you do that as soon as you can because as mentioned there are seats on the Eurostar with no or partial views and while minutes is under the Channel the rest of the journey is a chance to see the changing landscape Some Eurostar travelers also recommend bringing some kitchen towels or wet wipes and giving your window a clean â inside and out if you can â to improve the view What is the difference between Eurostar and Eurotunnel The Channel Tunnel aka the longest undersea tunnel in the world is a km miles marvel of engineering connecting the UK to the European continent While both Eurostar and Eurotunnel go through the rail tunnel these are two different carriers Eurostar is a high speed passenger train that connects London to Paris Brussels Amsterdam and other European destinations It departs from St Pancras International and goes to Paris Gare du Nord Brussels Midi and Amsterdam Centraal Eurotunnel is a company that operates Le Shuttle a train service for freight and various types of motor vehicles including cars bikes and trucks It connects Folkestone to Calais While foot passengers are not allowed on Le Shuttle you can travel with a bicycle Also pets are allowed Eurostar notoriously doesnâ t allow any pets on board Both Eurostar and Eurotunnel cross the Channel Tunnel in minutes Are there sleeper trains from London Youâ ve probably seen the headlines about Europeâ s new golden age of train travel with more passengers embracing the greener alternative to short haul flights In there has been an uptick in sleeper train services in Europe with new overnight routes from Paris to Berlin and Vienna to Hamburg on Ã BB s Nightjet Thereâ s also a European sleeper night train connecting London to Prague via Eurostar Itâ s a good way to travel in comfort and with a view Despite the challenges Brexit has put in its path Eurostar maintains its ambitions to reach million passengers by Given the London to Paris train journey emits times less carbon per passenger compared to flying of per person versus of it really does make sense to get to and from Europe by rail Frequently Asked Questions How much does the Eurostar cost from London to Paris The prices for a Standard class
