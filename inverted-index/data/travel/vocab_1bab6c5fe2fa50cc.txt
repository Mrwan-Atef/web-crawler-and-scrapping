floor says Morgan Murphy Cannella kelp restoration coordinator for Reef Check Worldwide a nonprofit focused on volunteer science to conserve reefs and kelp forests Despite a slight increase in kelp since in correlation with upwelling when wind brings nutrient rich cold water scientists say the problem is far from over The ocean is nowhere close to being back to a completely healthy and restored ecosystem says Tristin McHugh kelp project director for the Nature Conservancy How can travelers help While scientists keep an eye on the data visitors can learn about the coastal environment volunteer with local beach cleanup efforts and dine on the urchins wherever they re available Eating sea urchins for conservation At the Harbor House Inn executive chef Matthew Kammerer turns the echinoderm into the Michelin starred fare his restaurant is known for After carefully cracking open their outer shells he removes and cleans the edible inner lobes before adding them to a savory Japanese style egg custard called chawanmushi and a porridge made of local grains He also serves them in a dashi sauce drizzled on strips of celeriac that mimic pasta Pieces of urchin are even whipped into butter and candied with each preparation showcasing the myriad of ways to chow down for a good cause A diver brings up net bags full of purple sea urchins Restaurants rely on local divers to handpick the urchins because there is no viable way to harvest them commercially Photograph by Meg Roussos Bloomberg Getty Images After cracking the outer shell a worker scoops out the edible gonads from a sea urchin Photograph by Meg Roussos Bloomberg Getty Images Kammerer isn t the only top chef cooking for conservation Chefs at Little River Inn in Little River and Izakaya Gama in Point Arena have joined the culinary cause too These cooks try to use purple sea urchins whenever they can but despite their abundance in the ocean they re difficult to source Currently there is no established method of harvesting them for restaurants so the chefs rely on local divers or harvest them on their own When they can t get purple urchins many use larger commercially available red urchins No matter which kind of urchin appears on the plate locals hope that seeing them on menus more often will help break down the barrier to eating the spiny invertebrate which can seem intimidating Kammerer began serving them four years ago and so far diners have been positive We ask our guests to trust us and they end up usually really really enjoying it and getting their minds changed he says Meet the

years Semans reports Visitors can join occasional beach cleanups too Here s how to help scientists on your next vacation Since scientists have been tracking changes in the kelp canopy all along California s coast Now the Nature Conservancy UCLA UC Santa Barbara and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have partnered to make that data available to scientists and volunteers through a newly launched site called Kelpwatch Coordinated groups of divers have contributed to restoration efforts too Nearly pounds of purple urchins have been collected through a partnership involving California government entities communities and nonprofit organizations including Reef Check Worldwide Watermen s Alliance the Nature Conservancy and the Noyo Center for Marine Science Together with these conservation efforts Kammerer hopes that every bite of purple urchin he and others serve is a step toward restoring the kelp ecoystem The more information people know the more sea urchin they ll eat
