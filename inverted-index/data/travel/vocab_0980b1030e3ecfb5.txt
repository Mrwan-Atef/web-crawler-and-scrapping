Hitchiti word in the Muskogean language for bubbling water Early Mississippian people used these mounds for a variety of significant purposes including as funerary sites containing a hundred graves and the village chief s residence on the tallest mound The arrival of the British in attracted more Europeans all wanting to stake a claim to the traditional Muscogee territory In time the Muscogee
