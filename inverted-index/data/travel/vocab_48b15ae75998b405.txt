the Azores delivers views and adventure along easy paths and strenuous trails EyesTravelling Shutterstock Sandra chose these hikes when she returned to Portugal from her native Azores where she was researching the Pocket Azores travel guide The Azores are heaven for nature lovers and outdoors enthusiasts with dozens of hiking trails to choose from Well marked official paths cut through hills small woods and pastures twisting up and down the rugged basalt coast The experience of hiking in the Azores embodies the philosophy that itâ s the journey that matters not the destination as travelers uncover the islands protected nature reserves nature parks and quasi untouched landscapes in their wildest state Pack your hiking boots and trekking poles because youâ ll need them even on the trails classified as easy Uneven terrain causes many trails to be deemed moderate or hard While most of our suggestions for hikes follow official trails we ve included a few that are not classified as such but remain worthy of mention because of their views or better accessibility by travelers not as accustomed to hiking Advertisement Here are the best hikes in the Azores CaldeirÃ o crater at Corvo island Azores Francesco Riccardo Iacomino Getty Images CaldeirÃ o Best for grasping the smallest island Distance one way Estimated time to complete hours Level of difficulty Easy Corvo the smallest island in the Azores is also the most isolated boasting only one town with a little under people clustered on the lowest region near the ocean The rest is pastures and a water filled crater of the inactive volcano that originated the island â CaldeirÃ o Estrada do CaldeirÃ o starts at the only roundabout in Corvo â across from the post office â and snakes up the island through farmland and moss covered hills its inclination gently increasing the closer you get to your destination With any luck around you there wonâ t be more than an occasional farmer driving by peering eyes of grazing cattle and the feeling you have the island all to yourself If youâ re staying on the island walk up to CaldeirÃ o as early in the morning as possible before the tour boats from Flores arrive During peak season there can be more than a dozen people arriving in Corvo daily and theyâ ll all flock to the lagoon Brave the fog and wind for a hopefully clear view of the lagoon and then walk toward town before lunch For travelers on the island for just a few hours hitch a ride or pay someone to drive you up about â US per person and then walk back Monte da Guia Horta Azores Photo Eclipse Shutterstock Monte da Guia Best for exercise Distance roundtrip Estimated time to complete hour Level of difficulty Easy With good weather plenty of Horta locals park near FÃ brica da Baleia de Porto Pim and walk or cycle uphill to Monte da Guia and back on a mostly flat path Although it never truly gets busy most tourists drive up for sightseeing purposes or hike the Entre Montes FAI trail instead be prepared to share the road with folks on their daily exercise outings Near Forte de Nossa Senhora da Guia there is a must see viewpoint with one of the most spectacular views of nearby Mt Pico And of course take some time to appreciate the view over Porto Pim bay and Horta from the church at the top of the hill Colorful crater lake view from Miradouro do Inferno overlook on the Mata do CanÃ rio hiking path Shutterstock Mata do CanÃ rio Best for iconic landscapes Distance one way Estimated time to complete hours each way Level of difficulty Moderate Advertisement As one of the most visited islands in the Azores SÃ o Miguelâ s iconic lagoons and viewpoints often pop up on social media as the quintessential Azorean landscapes At the Mata do CanÃ rio trail you can find one of those envy inducing photo ops as you walk downhill on rough sometimes steep and slippery terrain with eyes locked on the famous blue and green lakes of Sete Cidades You can park your rental car near the starting point but itâ s simpler to drive to Sete Cidades and hire a taxi around â US to drop you at the trailhead and walk just one way The trail ends near Igreja de SÃ o Nicolau in the center of town View of FajÃ da Caldeira de Santo Cristo along the hiking route Serra do Topo Eefje Verbeek Getty Images SJO Best to experience the islands most famous trail Distance one way Estimated time to complete hours Level of difficulty Moderate This is the most famous trail in the archipelago and it comes with a true reward midway SÃ o Jorge s most isolated and hard to reach village FajÃ da Caldeira de Santo Cristo If you re on the island in the summer most accommodations and restaurants are closed off season and have time to spare split this hike in two and spend the night at Caldeira before heading to the final stop at FajÃ dos Cubres It s also a good trail to do as a family if youâ re traveling with older kids who can handle the walk with plenty of resting stops along the way This hiking route starts at Serra do Topo via a narrow slightly uphill dirt path lined with thick vegetation The trail begins to go gently downhill after about zigzagging around hills and cliffs â a trekking pole and hiking boots with good grip come in handy even more so if it has recently rained FajÃ de Lopo Vaz Flores Azores imageBROKER com Shutterstock FajÃ de Lopo Vaz Best for natural beauty Distance out and back Estimated time to complete hours Level of difficulty Moderate Ask any Azorean which island in the archipelago is the most beautiful and they ll tell you it s the one where they live of course rivaled only by Flores I second that not only because Flores is my home island but also because it s hard to beat its untouched natural beauty FajÃ de Lopo Vaz is one of Flores most famous hiking trails A very steep rock and dirt path that plunges down the island s south coast it s a challenging route that offers gorgeous views plants and flowers you wonâ t see elsewhere in Flores and a pebble beach where you can recharge before you go back up the same way Always mind your step and potential falling rocks and be sure to download the trail map beforehand as you won t have mobile service along the way Red windmill between CriaÃ Ã o velha vineyards Pico Azores kasakphoto Shutterstock Vinhas da CriaÃ Ã o Velha Best to experience a heritage walk Distance one way Estimated time to complete hours each way Level of difficulty Easy The landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and this walk takes you to the heart of it Set out on the trail from its official starting point in Porto do Calhau or do a shorter roundtrip version and begin at Porto da Areia Larga in Madalena â from here to the windmill it s about one way Regardless of where you choose to start from most of the path follows an oceanside road with a view to neighboring Faial and the ever present Mt Pico inland Mind the traffic â at the time of writing the road had been rebuilt after a major storm and parts of it didnâ t have sidewalks yet About halfway as you get closer to the bright red Moinho do Frade a gravel path will take you through the unique currais an intricate pattern of low basalt walls protecting the vines from the ocean After the hike if you want to complete the vineyards experience stop by Adega do VulcÃ o for a wine tasting ChÃ Gorreana the oldest tea plantation in Europe Damian Lugowski Shutterstock ChÃ Gorreana Best for tea lovers Distance km circular path Estimated time to complete minutes Level of difficulty Easy One of two tea farms in SÃ o Miguel and the oldest in Europe has its own official hiking trail The SMI trail starts across the street from FÃ brica de ChÃ Gorreana travels through small woods and pastures and finally takes travelers to the famous tea fields After walking around the tea farm and stopping to admire ocean views weather permitting follow the path back to the factory where hikers are invited to sample a complimentary cup of the locally grown brew Tips for hiking in the Azores If youâ re hiking alone let your accommodation or someone you trust know which trail youâ re taking what time youâ re starting the hike and when you expect to return Alternatively hire a taxi to drop you off and pick you up If you feel uncomfortable walking the trails alone plenty of local companies offer guided hiking tours The weather in the Azores can change fast especially closer to the coast or higher elevations Travel light but be equipped for sudden changes Every trails are marked with yellow and red striped signs â or red and white striped signs for a Grande Rota Great Route or long distance hiking trail â but outside of peak season and during storm season some paths may appear to be neglected Download an official trail map so you can check if you re on track along the way Some trails cut across pastures Make sure to always close gates behind you and try not to disturb any cattle also keep your eyes peeled for cow droppings Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Portugal Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers
