Apr min read Share Be ready for your vacation to Jamaica with these top tips on health safety and etiquette Â Peter Phipp Getty Images Pulsating reggae and dancehall beats aside Jamaica â s natural beauty â gorgeous beaches jungle covered mountains and tropical waterfalls â and world renowned culinary scene are what set it apart from other islands in the Caribbean Learning the nation s unspoken rules and etiquette goes a long way toward helping you understand what makes Jamaica such a remarkable place and manage any travel concerns you might have Here s everything you should know before you go Trips to the Blue Mountains can be organized from Kingston or Falmouth Â Hemis fr RM Getty Images Choose where to stay wisely Jamaica is one of the largest islands in the Caribbean so where you decide to stay depends on what youâ re into For beaches and water sports Negril and the north coast are your best bets Montego Bay and Ocho Rios combine excellent dining scenes with proximity to natural attractions and buzzy nightlife though when it comes to the Jamaican music scene Kingston â the capital â reigns supreme Advertisement Treasure Beach south coast and Port Antonio north coast offer a taste of low key laid back Jamaica while those interested in traditional Maroon culture can visit Charles Town on the northeastern coast Hiking up Blue Mountain peak and trekking in remote Cockpit Country are best organized from Kingston or Falmouth respectively Bring a mosquito net just in case Jamaican mosquitoes do not carry malaria but there are occasional outbreaks of dengue fever Some of the guesthouses and hotels donâ t provide mosquito nets so bring your own The best repellent for no see ums midges â tiny biting insects that live near water whose bites are extremely itchy â is Avon Skin So Soft Credit cards are accepted at most hotels and shops but away from the tourist destinations you need cash Â Byvalet Shutterstock Carry some cash In upmarket hotels shops and restaurants credit cards are almost universally accepted Elsewhere in Jamaica cash Jamaican dollars is king though in touristy destinations you can largely get by with US dollars ATMs and currency exchanges are plentiful in Montego Bay Kingston and Ocho Rios though currency exchanges cambios give you the best rates Airport rates are not great and youâ ll get hit with ATM charges if you withdraw cash Small change is best for buying from street vendors and using public transport You can travel during hurricane season Jamaica is vulnerable to hurricanes during the Atlantic hurricane season early June to late November most storms occur between August and October Timing your visit to Jamaica during hurricane season is possible if you follow a few basic rules Take out travel insurance that covers hurricanes Download a hurricane tracker app Decide as soon as possible whether youâ ll try to catch an early flight home which may be expensive difficult or hunker down in case of a hurricane Find out whether your hotel guesthouse has a hurricane shelter and whether itâ s likely to be affected by flooding or landslides bearing in mind that only hotels with private generators are unlikely to get hit by power outages Charge your electronics and make sure you have a flashlight first aid kit and a supply of food and water Comply with evacuation orders Consider relocating closer to the airport in Kingston or Montego Bay to make it easier to get help get out after a hurricane If Jamaica is hit by a hurricane have plenty of patience and be prepared to extend your trip You don t need to hire a car The main towns in Jamaica are served by a combination of comfortable air conditioned buses crowded minibuses and route taxis Itâ s entirely possible to get around Jamaica using public transportation though for exploring more remote destinations youâ ll need either ample time and patience or your own set of wheels If you plan on taking a road trip car hire is available at airports in Kingston and Montego Bay Feel free to let loose on a night out Casual summer wear is perfectly acceptable for most occasions though some upscale resorts and pricier restaurants expect smart casual attire At nightclubs in Kingston and Montego Bay â batty ridersâ skin tight shorts and similarly figure hugging tops are a popular choice for women while men tend to wear jeans and shirts Remember the vibe is laid back and nonjudgemental so staring or judging is unacceptable If something casual and low key is more your fashion speed come as you are Itâ s a party after all If youâ re a newcomer to the dancehall scene it can be a real eye opener The dancing can be pretty suggestive and locals try to outdo each other when it comes to â whiningâ â gyrating hips and waists to the music Youâ ll likely get pushed into the melee and then itâ s sink or swim time Youâ ll get a lot of good natured remarks from regulars if you give the dancing your best shot and they might even offer to teach you to dance Experience the very best of Jamaica s nightlife by letting loose and joining in Â iStockphoto Getty Images Stay up for the nightlife Jamaica never sleeps At least thatâ s true for Kingston Negril Montego Bay and Ocho Rios Negril is best for beach parties while Kingston has the slickest nightclubs the best music events and street dances Advertisement Things rarely get going before midnight and revelers party until sunrise Overnight reggae and dancehall concerts involve at least a dozen performers with the audience expressing their enthusiasm with shouts of â bullet bullet â and two finger gun salutes Itâ s raucous but typically all in good fun Do talk to strangers Unlike many other big cities where striking up conversations with strangers is a massive faux pas in Jamaica the opposite is true Some Jamaicans will talk with you in the hopes of doing business see â How to handle hustling and harassmentâ Still many are genuinely interested in learning more about you and find standoffishness offensive Youâ ll find yourself saying â good morningâ â good afternoonâ and â good nightâ in greeting as well as farewell a whole lot Elders are treated with extra respect An exchange of friendly banter with vendors trying to sell you fruit or souvenirs is infinitely preferable to coldly ignoring people just trying to make a living Respect Rastafarianism Around of Jamaicans practice Rastafarianism This religious and political movement combines Biblical teachings with seeing Ethiopia as the Promised Land using ganja in order to commune with Jah God and living a â naturalâ lifestyle involving I tal food free from artificial additives and the growing of locs and beards for men Some Rastafarians live in small secluded and self sustaining communities â outsiders may only visit if they contact the elders in advance to request permission The Rastafari Indigenous Village outside Montego Bay is a more accessible and much more touristy experience There may be some flexibility with prices at local markets Â Debbie Ann Powell Shutterstock Gentle bartering over prices is common in markets Gentle haggling is common and expected when youâ re buying souvenirs from individual sellers or shopping in local markets Elsewhere youâ re expected to pay the stated price As always be respectful of the fact this is someone s livelihood and if you re not happy with the price walk away with a smile Jamaica is not an LGBTIQ friendly country Jamaican society is largely homophobic and the gay scene in Kingston is firmly underground with public displays of affection between gay couples strongly inadvisable â sexual acts between men are illegal and punishable by up to years in prison That said in popular tourist destinations there are hotels including some all inclusive that welcome LGBTIQ travelers Clean public bathrooms are not easily found Shopping malls cafes and restaurants charge for the use of their facilities which donâ t always meet basic hygiene standards and woe betide you if you need the bathroom away from the hospitality sector Jamaican tap water is generally drinkable Jamaicaâ s tap water is generally safe to drink in most parts of the island Avoid faucet water in far flung rural areas and steer clear of ice sold at street stands as bellywash snocones or skyjuice shaved ice cones sweetened with fruit juice While bottled water is readily available recycling plastic is an issue so itâ s best to bring reusable flasks with you Vegetarian and vegans can eat well in Jamaica Plant based I tal vital food an essential tenet of Rastafarianism is widely available and delicious Expect freshly squeezed fruit juices plantain fritters steamed callaloo Jamaicaâ s answer to spinach tropical fruit and much more In non Rasta eateries rice â nâ peas rice with kidney beans is the most common accompaniment to most dishes Expect hustlers to hustle and sometimes harass Travelers are extremely likely to encounter constant sales pitches from hustlers particularly around the major tourist centers or Montego Bay Negril and Ocho Rios Some may be aggressively persistent in the hopes that youâ ll buy whatever it is theyâ re selling just to be left alone be firm yet polite in your refusals Avoid common payment scams when taking tours Common scams involve young men offering transportation to a popular tourist attraction waterfall swimming hole and then claiming that you only paid a one way fee Self appointed â guidesâ may come up with various add ons at the end of tours so in both cases be absolutely clear as to what the agreed upon fee covers before accepting their services Gang violence doesn t target tourists Organized crime in Jamaica revolves around gang violence In the Jamaicaâ s two rival political parties armed their supporters in Kingstonâ s neighborhoods and set in motion deadly feuds lasting generations Today neighborhoods are controlled by local dons who are no longer reliant on politicians for guns or money Gang violence does not target visitors unless you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time Opportunistic muggings and pickpocketing do occur however so itâ s best to take common sense precautions taking a taxi back at night carrying as little cash as possible Female travelers have reported assaults If youâ re a single woman you may well find yourself on the receiving end of anything from flirting to blunt propositioning â constant come ons can be wearying Be polite yet firm if you are not interested There have been a number of assaults on female tourists by staff at some of Jamaicaâ s top beach resorts over the years with the allegations mishandled covered up or with trips refunded in exchange for signing non disclosure agreements Smoking ganja weed in public is still illegal Smoking â di holy herbâ is an integral part of life not just for the Rastafari but also for a substantial number of Jamaicans Weed is ubiquitous and cheap and you are very likely to be approached by vendors selling joints Since ganja has been decriminalized and while smoking weed in public is still illegal and punishable with a fine of J you may have up to two ounces for personal use without it going on your criminal record Exceptions are made for religious and medical purposes Several medical dispensaries have opened up around the country in Kingston St Annâ s Bay Falmouth and Montego Bay where visitors may legally purchase marijuana with a doctorâ s prescription and make use of on site smoking rooms But if you try to take some ganja home at the end of your vacation youâ ll find your Jamaica stay extended by two years in Fort Augusta prison for women or Spanish Town prison for men Other drugs and law enforcement Besides ganja cocaine is also widely available Jamaica is a major trans shipment point for the Colombiaâ US route along with hallucinogenic â teaâ made from wild mushrooms The global drugs trade helps to fuel gang violence particularly in Kingston and Montego Bay and penalties for possession of hard drugs are severe You may encounter roadblocks and random car searches performed by police in combat gear occasional extortion to supplement wages is not unheard of Donâ t accept drinks from strangers in nightclubs since date rape drugs are a concern Driving in Jamaica is not for the fainthearted In contrast to their typical laid back attitude many Jamaicans drive hard and fast especially around cities and along winding mountain roads Watch out for drivers overtaking around blind corners and swerving onto the opposite side of the road to avoid ubiquitous potholes Drive on the left and perhaps avoid Kingston and Montego Bay if youâ re a first timer Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE
