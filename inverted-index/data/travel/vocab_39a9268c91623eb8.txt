these Lousianan dishes prove a lesson in the state s history topography and culinary traditions Long a staple of Louisiana s cuisine the po boy is said to have been created by two brothers during a streetcar strike in Photograph by Explore Louisiana By Tom Burson March Being so uniquely Louisianan the world class dishes created in this Southern state are nearly impossible to define simply as American The cuisine here reflects a varied tapestry of cultures with the influence of France Spain West Africa the Caribbean Germany Italy and Native Americans woven into its distinct recipes In the west you have Cajun country an area populated by Acadians originally from French speaking Canada In the north Southern style home cooking is the order of the day Then there s the Creole influence in the lively city of New Orleans Wherever you head many dishes are dominated by a slow cooked roux and the holy trinity a mixture of onions peppers and celery Louisiana s answer to the mirepoix a base of diced vegetables Discover this and much more of the Bayou State s cuisine at its absolute best by sampling five of its standout dishes Travel on one of Louisiana s historic red streetcars as you weave between restaurants in New Orleans French Quarter Photograph by Explore Louisiana Gumbo Gumbo is Louisiana encapsulated in a single dish a cultural melting pot in which Gallic Spanish Choctaw West African Caribbean and Southern culinary traditions collide The most familiar gumbos are made with seafood as well as chicken and sausage but in reality recipes vary across the state When it comes to preparing the dish a few points of contention exist Some people use tomatoes in their recipe whereas others consider that sacrilege Some gumbos are thickened with okra and others use filé a spicy herb seasoning Then there are chefs who swear by a dark chocolate coloured roux versus those who favour a lighter colour Depending on where you re visiting gumbo may be a dressed up soup with shrimp sausage crab and tomato like in Creole influenced New Orleans or a heartier gravy thick stew made with game birds seafood and certainly no tomato found in the Cajun Acadiana region Nobody agrees about the one true way to cook this dish but every Louisianan will agree that a piping hot bowl of gumbo is one of life s most cherished pleasures Where to try it Rachel s Cafe in Lafayette serves up

comforting combination of thick and creamy rice stewed with meat seafood and vegetables It s a dish that s often cooked in massive proportions for celebrations and communal gatherings Like many of the state s signature foods views on what constitutes a proper jambalaya depend on where you re from as there are hundreds of variations with home cooks liable to voraciously defend their own preferred method Cajun jambalaya is known for its bold spicy flavour with no tomatoes The New Orleans red jambalaya on the other hand includes tomatoes and is primarily found in and around the city Almost every iteration though will begin with a golden brown roux and the holy trinity and for most people hot sauce is also a necessity Where to try it The Jambalaya Shoppe in Baton Rouge serves up solid spicy Cajun renditions of the dish There s also Evangeline in New Orleans Marilynn s Place in Shreveport and Johnson s Boucanière in Lafayette Jambalaya is a comforting rice dish combined with fish meat or

red beans and rice for dinner The dish has been a staple across the state for centuries legend has it that its popularity derives more from necessity than culinary tradition Historically Louisianians would cook up a ham on Sunday nights Monday was typically laundry day so amid the washing home cooks would reuse the ham bone and slow cook it in red beans along with the holy trinity cayenne and leftover bits of ham and sausage The consistency of the resulting red beans is that of a creamy soup with soft bean chunks and it s served atop white rice Today the beloved comfort food has made its way beyond the back burner at home and into the state s most famous kitchens Where to try it This dish is the Monday special at Lil Dizzys in New Orleans The beans are simmered all day and you can
