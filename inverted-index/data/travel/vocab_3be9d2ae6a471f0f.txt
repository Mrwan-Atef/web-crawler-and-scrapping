Overview Hotels Restaurants See Neighborhoods Shopping Nightlife Gallery How Celebrities Almost Ruined My All Inclusive Getaway Bill Caco March Courtesy AVA Cancun Destinations Mexico and Central America Mexico Cancún Hotels Lodging Save So many celebs so little time In my younger days all inclusive resorts dangled the promise of easy endless indulgence What they usually delivered however was cheap booze sad foam parties and regret That s probably why I haven t been to one in over a decade But then I read about Ava a brand new all inclusive hotel in Cancun focused on providing a luxury experience Hmm I like those Twenty seven restaurants and bars led by award winning chefs and mixologists Um yes please Sixteen hundred rooms all with balconies spa tubs and ocean views Ok ok I m in So I called up my friend Kevin who I hadn t seen in ages and asked if he wanted to make it a Guys of a Certain Age Trip He was online booking flights before the call was over A long relaxing weekend hanging with an old friend sipping margs poolside and sampling curated cuisine from across the globe was just what I needed Ava promised an opulent and exclusive escape but as I would soon discover it also came with an unexpected twist a steady stream of celebrities and influencers buzzing about the place threatening to derail my leisurely Zen getaway A Shortcut to Paradise The first thing I notice about the Ava is how close it is to the airport Cancun s Hotel Zone is usually a minute drive from the airport and the resorts in Playa del Carmen and Riviera Maya are an hour But the Ava Ten minutes

Article After Our Video Recommended Fodor s Video The grand lobby welcomes me with a blast of cool air the faint scent of citrus and the possibility of a White Lotus style adventure I drop my bag off in the tastefully decorated room while quickly soaking in the killer ocean views from the balcony and make my way down to The Cocktail Bar where Kevin is waiting AVA Cancun s grand lobby Courtesy AVA Cancun The bar at the AVA A well made margarita is in my hand faster than I can say Hey is that JaRule Why would I say that you ask Well because it was in fact JaRule walking past the bar inviting us all to a whiskey tasting he was hosting the next day His new whiskey brand of course Not now JaRule I m trying to catch up with my friend here We ll Holla Holla at you later JaRule livin it up at The Cocktail Bar Bill Caco The bartender tells us that it s going to be a celebrity studded weekend at the resort culminating with a big Dia de Los Muertos themed party where Joe Jonas will guest DJ Cool I say even though I am admittedly not a Joe Jonas aficionado I know he has some boy band brothers and that the younger women at the bar seem excited but whatever this weekend is not about gawking at celebs it s about me my bud and a lounge chair And food All the glorious food Where Every Meal Is a Destination The dining options at the Ava are impressive There s a steakhouse a French bistro and a host of other spots serving Italian Mediterranean Asian you name it For our first dinner we choose Copal a modern restaurant serving regional sustainably sourced Mexican fare Copal is led by Chef Lula Martín del Campo and I try her signature dish the beef filet with ash and cotija cheese sauce which is both earthy and out of this world It arrives perfectly seared its savory aroma mingling nicely with the salt from my margarita Chef Lula s goal at Copal is to honor the rich flavors and distinctive smoke that have always been part of Mexican cuisine And as a bonus Copal tacos are available all day at the taco stand outside because nothing says luxury like a fistful of tacos on the go The Glow Up Generation Takes Over After dinner we head to a lively outdoor bar overlooking the ocean Very resort chic You know well dressed somethings flitting about laughing sipping cocktails That is except for me and Kevin who sit at the end of the bar quietly enjoying a couple of Pacificos Swirling around us is a scene right out of a nature documentary about influencers in the wild A girl at the bar orders a martini just for the photo op Off in the corner by himself a guy toasts to his cell phone And ring lights So many ring lights on tripods no less Everyone looks to be at the party of a lifetime at least while the cameras are rolling Once the phones drop all the smiling faces suddenly reset back to neutral I ve never felt more like an AARP member and honestly it s liberating Being the out of place middle aged guy at the end of the bar feels like a win here A double room at the AVA Courtesy AVA Cancun Room balconies come with a hot tub Mornings Done Right Mornings at all inclusives are generally the domain of screaming kids doing cannonballs at the pool and zombified adults recovering from the previous night s excesses My mornings at this particular all inclusive however were quite delightful thanks to their charming cafe Aroma a quiet oasis where the cappuccinos are rich the pastries are flaky and the only sound is the occasional clink of a spoon against porcelain It s the type of moment I never would have experienced in my because back then all I was looking for was tequila and rowdy behavior Where there s one there s sure to be the other But now it s perfecto I notice a lot of things now that I wouldn t have back then like the fact that there s actually a lot to do when you re not sleeping the day away You can take advantage of the state of the art fitness center and spa kayak or paddleboard in the acre saltwater Ava Bay or even roll a few games at the on site bowling alley I of course will be doing none of that My mission is to sit poolside with my friend and become one with the chill Mexican vibes So we find the adults only pool on the far side of the resort pull up some lounge chairs and get to sittin Poolside at the AVA Courtesy AVA Cancun Poolside Cannon Blasts Sinking into my lounger I m finally feeling the serenity I ve been seeking After all what says vacation more than stretching out under the warm sun the scent of coconut sunscreen and chlorine in the air But then I hear someone say How y all doing today over the sound system followed by a distinctive thump thump thump Oh no I think this pool has a DJ Our relaxing afternoon is about to turn into a bacchanal of manufactured fun and head pounding EDM beats Girls scurry to the DJ booth phones in hand while I busy myself figuring out if I can order nachos from my seat As one passes by I hear her say Oh my God it s Nick Cannon Yep that s right Nick Cannon is DJing our pool party today Totes bussin brah A file photo of Nick Cannon Denis Makarenko Shutterstock Now I don t watch The Masked Singer or America s Got Jugglers so I can t say that I m a Nick Cannon fan but I was pleasantly surprised when most of his set consisted of and bangers Prince Bel Biv DeVoe Nelly Suddenly I m transported back to the days of mixtapes baggy pants and frosted tips Tranquil it was not But a little toe tappin and memory lane walkin never ruined a party And thankfully there wasn t a bit of foam in sight The Universal Language of Teppanyaki One of the charms of travel is the opportunity to interact with people from all around the world And what better environment to do so than around the table in a teppanyaki restaurant like Ava s Kita As the chef delights us with sleight of hand grill work and time honored onion volcanos we get to chatting with the lovely Mexican couple sitting next to us Late with two young kids in tow they talk to us about Mexican politics the job market and the challenges of parenthood and modern life south of the border Then heads start turning as a well dressed blond and her crew enter drawing the attention of our tablemates They tell me it s Julianne Hough from Dancing with the Stars Suddenly the conversation shifts from our lives to hers and how she is at the resort this weekend promoting her dance and fitness platform KINRGY Julianne Hough center about to get her teppanyaki on Bill Caco You should take one of her early morning classes while you re here the wife says No No I should not I reply Because Rule of guys trips There are no a m dance workouts And just like that the small intimate dinner we were enjoying slipped away drawn into the orbit of planet celebrity A Farewell Fiesta to Die For On our final night we head over to the Dia de Los Muertos themed shindig which is done up like a Hollywood premiere bright lights red carpet photographers documenting every move and scores of people jostling for position so they can catch a glimpse of someone famous I on the other hand make my way to the nearby tequila cart so I can catch a glimpse of some local reposado Kevin and I trade various versions of Who is that and Don t know as we sip and watch the flashbulb parade go by It s actually kind of fun like being dropped into a foreign land where you don t speak the language and trying to figure out what everyone is going on about Then I see a familiar face Isn t that the girl from The Hangover movies I ask Kevin shrugs but I beam with pride at having finally recognized someone Jamie Chung actress that I recognize Bill Caco When we finally make it inside the Dia de Los Muertos party my attitude suddenly shifts Gone is the aging curmudgeon focused on Gen Z foolishness I m now fresh faced and smiling at the epic transformation this ballroom has undergone from boring builder s beige to thumping nightclub on par with Vegas or Mexico City Dancers wearing skeleton make up and elaborate hats a staple of Day of the Dead celebrations known as Catrinas weave through the crowd under a massive LED lightshow chandelier Giant skeleton puppets in festive garb boogie on the dancefloor as Joe Jonas mans the baseline from the stage And once again old school and hits dominate the set making me feel like Joe is ignoring all these somethings and playing just for me Joe Jonas DJs to the cell phone dancefloor Bill Caco Not even the sad state of the dance floor can sour my mood Seriously does no one dance at clubs anymore Throughout Jonas entire set everyone just stood there filming it on their phones But whatever I m not going to let these wayward kids ruin my final night fiesta All Inclusive All Grown Up After the music fades and some post party tacos are had I find myself back on the balcony of my room winding down to the gentle rhythm of the ocean This place actually delivered everything it promised luxury indulgence and a touch of the unexpected Sure I could have done without all the celebrity hubbub but ultimately I got what I came here for a chance to slow down reconnect with an old friend and embrace the rare joy of doing absolutely nothing It s funny back in my all inclusives were about chasing the kind of fun that left you needing a vacation from your vacation But this weekend was different It wasn t about going hard it was about letting go Maybe all inclusives have grown up or maybe I have
