Islands Lauren Keith Dec min read Share Travelers heading to the Canaries could go from Morocco Â Stian Klo Lonely Planet Advertisement Morocco is looking to create a new passenger and freight ferry route to Spainâ s Canary Islands and the Moroccan government is currently seeking proposals from companies to operate the line The Canary Island of Fuerteventura lies less than off Moroccoâ s Atlantic Coast and the route would operate from the remote Moroccan port town of Tarfaya which is nearly south of Marrakesh The Moroccan government hopes that â this direct link will contribute to the economic and social development of the Southern Provinces of the Kingdom and will further facilitate the flow of goods and passengersâ The journey by boat could take under two hours and Tarfayaâ s port was recently renovated to accommodate larger vessels Advertisement The ferries would help travelers get to the Canary Islands Â lunamarina Shutterstock Occasional flights from Royal Air Maroc and Spanish airline Binter operate between Moroccan cities and the Canary Islands but they donâ t run every day and are mostly scheduled in the summer high season between July and September Most visitors who want to want to travel between Morocco and the Canary Islands must connect through mainland Spain A ferry previously operated the route between Tarfaya and Fuerteventura in but after just five months in service it ran aground off the Moroccan coast because of strong winds and the route was never resurrected At the moment the Moroccan government is only requesting expressions of interest so thereâ s no firm date when the route would be operational for travelers In September Morocco reopened its borders to travelers with hotel reservations and the Canary Islands are open to EU residents as well as citizens from countries with low coronavirus case loads such as South Korea New Zealand and Australia Some of the remote Canary Islands such as El Hierro and Isla Graciosa have not registered any coronavirus cases You might also like Will this self driving ferry in Norway revolutionise public transport With cruises curtailed Alaska s state ferry could become the top way to explore the coast
