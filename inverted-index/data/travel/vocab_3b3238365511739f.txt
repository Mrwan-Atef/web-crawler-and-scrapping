endemic honeycreeper birds some of which are critically endangered Photograph by Allan Baxter Getty Images By Megan Ulu Lani Boyanton September Tourists in Hawai i are stumbling upon iwi kūpuna the bones of Native Hawaiians ancestors when they explore beaches like the Puamana Beach Park and rock climb the seaside and forest cliffs where those remains were laid to rest A tradition for at least two millennia these burial sites which also include sand dunes are recognized as sacred places for their descendants In ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi Hawaiian language the word for bury and the word for plant it s not strange that they re the same word says Mehanaokalā Hind senior adviser at the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement We plant the ancestors back into the spaces that will allow them to return to Papa return to Haumea she adds referencing two Hawaiian goddesses Beaches on Maui Hawai i Island and Moloka i are susceptible to curious visitors digging into their dunes and Hawai i Island O ahu and Kaua i are known for their burial caves Traveling to O ahu Plan your trip with these travel tips Mana Kaleilani Cáceres serves as an advocate at Hui Iwi Kuamoʻo an organization that repatriates and buries iwi kūpuna During his six year stint on the O ahu Island Burial Council he fielded countless social media posts that featured tourists interacting with Hawaiian ancestral bones It s kind of been an issue for all these years says Cáceres I see it happening more frequently with pictures and videos online Disturbances of iwi kūpuna have occurred for more than a century and sometimes purposefully Europeans first plundered the bones from the islands to probe and exhibit them and many still sit in museums around the globe Local organizations have made it their kuleana responsibility to right these wrongs with The Hawaiian Church of Hawaiʻi Nei and Hui Iwi Kuamoʻo protecting the bones Meanwhile Kānaka Climbers educates nature lovers on how to act as ethical guests Here s what you need to know to visit the Hawaiian Islands more respectfully See Hawai I hula dancing like you ve never seen it before Hike state managed trails like O ahu s Mānoa Falls Trail Sticking to state managed trails like the Manoa Falls Trail on Oahu is one way travelers can avoid disturbing sacred sites Photograph by Roman Khomlyak Getty Images Travelers can avoid encounters with iwi kūpuna and follow state managed trails that grant tourists ethical access to the outdoors Unofficial and illegal trails found on websites like AllTrails can take them to unintended places At Nuʻuanu Pali State Wayside park on O ahu Cáceres has watched tourists forge their own hiking trails You can see that it s a big problem he says Kānaka Climbers has flagged certain locations where climbers shouldn t venture because they could be potential burial sites If the local people are informing you not to go to certain spaces listen to them Hind says Show hōʻihi respect if you hike a historic trail A number of historic trails are open to public use and they remain important to Kānaka ʻŌiwi Native Hawaiians Some may lead hikers near the rocks that once made up heiau ancient temples that should be treated with the same reverence as churches Others skirt past sacred pōhaku rock Still bad behavior happens in these spiritual spaces The Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail is a mile network of culturally significant trails Photograph by JFerrer Getty Images The Hawaiian Church of Hawaiʻi Nei s ʻIhilani Chu has heard anecdotes about the desecration of heiau including a man urinating on one Skye Kolealani Razon Olds started her nonprofit Kānaka Climbers to educate the outdoor recreation community about Hawaiian history and culture after seeing climbers scale a pōhaku that s also a petroglyph site in southern O ahu As a keiki child it was where my grandmother would take us to tell us stories about the demigods that lived in the area Razon Olds says It s a great place just to remember that Hawaiian culture is still here and our community is still very active Travelers should research these trails ahead of time and know what s expected of visitors Plan a couple s getaway to the Hawaiian Islands and consider these fun adventures Volunteer with the Mālama Hawaiʻi Program The Mālama Hawaiʻi Program gives tourists the opportunity to appropriately take part in Hawaiian culture Volunteers can clean up the coasts in Kaua i plant native species at a Maui wildlife refuge and work outside on a Hawai i Island farm near Mauna Kea As an added bonus volunteers earn discounts at certain hotels and sometimes a free night s stay for their efforts The impact of regenerative tourism is a softer footprint on our ʻāina land but also a positive economic impact on Hawai i s families Hind at the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement says Use sustainable tour operators Steer clear of published guidebooks that use buzz words like secret spaces which tend towards the exotic Hind cautions She explains that these terms use exotification to entice tourists toward places on the islands that are kept private for good reasons The end result of visiting could fall on a range from disrespectful to dangerous Hind says Instead the Sustainable Tourism Association of Hawaiʻi STAH recommends a list of eco friendly tour operators on O ahu Maui Kaua i and Hawai i Island to escort travelers through parks and attractions Examples include Holo Holo Charters on Kaua i and Valley Isle Excursions on Maui With its rugged coastline and mist covered rainforest Pihea Trail on Kaua i is home to an array of native wildlife and vegetation Photograph by Diane Cook and Len Jenshel Nat Geo Image Collection Visitors can still hike and bike on land or snorkel and dive in the sea but they ll follow local guides who are certified in sustainability by the STAH These tour companies are given the stamp of approval through the Sustainable Tour Operator Certification Program which requires hours of training an audit and the appointment of a sustainability coordinator Every year these operators must recertify to ensure they re dedicated to providing education about Hawaiian culture acting as stewards to the islands natural resources and more From authentic Polynesian fare to national parks here s what you should know about Maui Don t geotag hidden gems including burial caves Tourists who stumble across little known places on the islands are advised against sharing them on social media which often leads to overcrowding As social media has grown so much it s become easier and easier for people to go to these places Razon Olds at Kānaka Climbers says That becomes the new spot everybody searches for and it kind of invites the wrong people Hui Iwi Kuamoʻo s Cáceres recalls sealing a burial cave with cement to protect the bones inside Months later he saw the mouth of the cave geotagged on social media Photos of burial caves and iwi kūpuna are never allowed It s kapu forbidden to enter the caves even for Hawaiians That s for their protection says Kahu Pohaleo Loko olu Quintero a priest at The Hawaiian Church of Hawaiʻi Nei Instead visitors who come across iwi kūpuna during their time on the islands should call the Hawai i Department of Land and Natural Resources Enforcement By making small tweaks to their itineraries tourists can still enjoy Hawaiian lands
