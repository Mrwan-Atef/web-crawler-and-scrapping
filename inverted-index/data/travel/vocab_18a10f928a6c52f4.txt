LADZINSKI By Ronan O Connell November min read On October the U S Department of State issued a rare advisory that Americans overseas exercise increased caution due to heightened tensions and chances of terrorism around the world spurred by the Israel Hamas war It s part of a system of travel warnings that s been around in some form since designed to help citizens assess how safe a destination might be at a given time The current version of the system which launched in gives fluid rankings from Level exercise normal precautions to Level do not travel indicating how risky countries and in some cases regions are for Americans to visit Rankings are based on factors such as crime rates civil unrest and the threat of terrorism They are meant to give clear timely and reliable information about every country in the world so they can make informed travel decisions says a State Department spokesperson Not surprisingly on October the State Department moved Israel and the West Bank to Level reconsider travel and Gaza to Level Here s how the advisories work and how to use them What is a travel advisory The U S State Department inaugurated the travel advisory system in initially aiming warnings at airlines and travel companies The system was scrutinized after the bombing of a Pan Am flight from London to New York which exploded over Lockerbie Scotland killing all passengers and crew plus people on the ground Investigations found U S authorities had been aware of a credible threat to a Pan Am flight but hadn t informed the public In response the media and consular offices began issuing travel warnings In the U S introduced its current four tier advisory system There are near identical versions in Canada Australia and New Zealand To determine rankings the State Department considers a nation s political volatility crime trends medical care standards and the threat of kidnappings or terrorism Politics also ends up playing an unspoken role Some countries such as Russia receive a Level ranking partly because the U S government may have limited ability to assist citizens there Others rise to Level due to a crisis such as the military coup that recently rocked Niger When the travel advisory system relaunched in it also included state by state evaluations for Mexico which draws more than million American travelers a year Some Mexican states are quite safe for U S tourists while others are riskier due to narco trafficking violence says Ryan Larsen executive director of the Institute for Global Engagement at Western Washington University Yucatán and Campeche states are currently at Level while six other Mexican states are at Level including Sinaloa Solo female travelers share tips for staying safe on the road Epidemics and natural disasters also can prompt a travel advisory number to rise Americans may be prompted to reconsider visiting a country recovering from a tsunami or major wildfires since their presence could hinder rehabilitation efforts This occurred after the February earthquakes in Turkey Such advisories can remain in place for weeks or months The strictest ever advisories came in April amid the COVID pandemic says Larsen who did a thesis on U S travel warnings At that time about percent of the world s countries were at Level At press time about percent of the world s countries were rated Level or Level by the State Department indicating they re relatively safe There are currently countries at Level and at Level How to use travel advisories Before booking an international trip consult the State Department website to see where your destination ranks While Level and countries are considered relatively safe you should still register with the U S Smart Traveler Enrollment Program STEP This lets Americans overseas use their smartphone to receive travel advisory updates and alerts about emerging dangers in their destination protests extreme weather Level countries are considered more dangerous for foreign visitors who should reconsider travel according to the State Department If you are headed to a Level country which currently includes Pakistan and Colombia do wider research on its safety and on the places you ll visit there advises Jun Wen a professor of tourism at Australia s Edith Cowan University For instance while some remote areas in the Colombian Amazon still suffer from drug related violence cities such as Cartagena and Medellín are relatively safe Going on a fully guided group or individual tour can also help you navigate destinations where political unrest or crime might impact your safety Travelers should study not only the advisories provided by their own country but also by the U S United Kingdom and Australia to broaden their understanding of the risks in Level countries Wen says As for Level countries that Do Not Travel advice couldn t be any clearer Other countries also issue warnings to their citizens about visiting the U S Canada recently informed its LGBTQ travelers they may be affected by laws in certain U S states Australia meanwhile cautions its citizens visiting the U S to be wary of higher crime rates and gun violence and even to learn safety strategies for active shooter scenarios People who visit countries with Level or Level travel advisories don t just risk their safety They also may have travel insurance complications says Linchi Kwok tourism management professor at California State Polytechnic University Pomona How travel insurance can and can t help when your plans change They must pay much higher premiums and their insurance can be invalidated if the advisory for their destination is elevated Medical coverage can be minimal too particularly if the travel advisory is put up against a disease or an outbreak says Kwok I encourage Americans to think twice before they travel to Level and especially Level destinations Warnings and their impact on tourism Travel advisories can be biased Larsen argues His research found that while the U S didn t often overstate the risk of travel to countries with which it had poor relations it did often understate the danger of visiting nations that were its close allies Elevating a travel advisory can stoke diplomatic tensions between two countries Once a country is raised to Level or many tourists will avoid visiting and many American universities won t let students join study abroad programs The economic ramifications of a level change impact individual businesses such as hotels restaurants and travel agencies For instance J adventures a Jewish focused tour company saw most of its fall group trips to Israel canceled after the start of the Israel Hamas war and the higher advisory level says cofounder Guy Millo This is not just because of the violence on the ground but because of practical considerations like accessibility of commercial airline flights he says Most tourists from North America and places around the globe simply couldn t get here even if they
