sur Oise Janine Eberle Apr min read Share The red doored and red walled home of painter Charles FranÃ ois Daubigny at Auvers sur Oise France Â Janine Eberle Lonely Planet Genteel peaceful Auvers sur Oise just kilometres from Paris already had pedigree as an artistsâ village when Vincent van Gogh arrived in the spring of However during his short intense stay the Dutch master would paint works in days â a frenzy of productivity that would end with his death from a gunshot wound in his tiny room at the main streetâ s auberge inn As a new multimedia exhibition on Impressionism opens at the ChÃ teau dâ Auvers sur Oise we retrace the final days of the tortured genius through this quiet but now infamous commune Advertisement Pretty Auvers sur Oise was already attracting artists before Van Gogh arrived Â Janine Eberle Lonely Planet Van Gogh was not the first artist to discover the rural charms of Auvers In the mid the railway opened up the Oise valley to Paris â thriving artistic milieu Less than an hour from the metropolis the rolling fields picturesque river and rugged farming folk provided Impressionist painters with their preferred subject matter landscapes and life outdoors This impressive artistic heritage is celebrated in a blockbuster exhibition at the newly reopened ChÃ teau dâ Auvers sur Oise Along with the townâ s more understated attractions it paints a fascinating portrait of a time when this little village was at the epicentre of art innovation and a troubled unknown artist was painting canvasses that would one day be amongst the critics most beloved A copy of Van Gogh s Church at Auvers stands next to the chapel itself Â Janine Eberle Lonely Planet â Auvers is seriously beautifulâ Or â gravement beauâ as Vincent would write to his brother Theo soon after arriving He was fresh from a turbulent stay in Provence which had ended with a year long stint in a mental health institution and Theo had organised for a local Auvers doctor Paul Gachet to watch over the troubled artist so he could retain his equilibrium and paint At first the villageâ s bucolic charm its thatched roof cottages and setting on the pretty Oise River proved inspirational Ambitious to render all he saw in his own vivid terms â the countryside its natural light the local people â Vincent became a familiar fixture in the town roaming all over He would start out every morning with his palette and oils and work in all conditions â rain raging heat night Advertisement Today you can follow in his footsteps and quite literally see what he saw Dotted around the townâ s lanes and trails are panels that reproduce the works Van Gogh painted in front of the scenes that they depict The tourist office map is like a self guided treasure hunt allowing visitors to wander the townâ s any which way tracks seeking out these small shrines A reproduction of Van Goghâ s painting Church at Auvers stands in front of the gothic cream bricked chapel itself It offers a breath taking moment of understanding and a new appreciation of the artistâ s gift â how he remade reality the strange beauty that he saw The simply furnished room at the Auberge Ravoux where Van Gogh stayed during his time at Auvers sur Oise Â Institut Van Gogh Van Goghâ s last days That beauty had its dark side Contemporary photos of the Bastille Day celebrations at the Auvers sur Oise town hall in show costumed locals music and merriment Vincentâ s painted version portrays the sad deflated after party The peaceful pretty fields just outside town seem another world from his melancholy take on them often overshadowed by a troubled crow filled sky One Sunday night in July the artist returned to his room at the auberge with a bullet lodged in his chest He said it had been self inflicted earlier that afternoon though there are more nefarious theories of how the bullet got there The Ravoux family who owned the inn called for Dr Gachet and wired Theo in Paris The artist died in in the early hours of Tuesday morning with his brother by his bedside Auberge Ravoux has been lovingly restored the dining room with its wood panelling and zinc counter looks as it did in the late th century when Van Gogh took his meals here as part of his francs per night lodging After his death his room at the top of the stairs was never rented out again You can visit it today at seven square metres with a tiny skylight and cracked walls its monastic air only adds to the sense of sadness The century ChÃ teau dâ Auvers sur Oise has a multimedia exhibition about Impressionism Â Janine Eberle Lonely Planet The Impressionist legacy â The Impressionist Visionâ a new multimedia exhibition housed in the stately ChÃ teau dâ Auvers sur Oise shows Van Gogh in a post Impressionist context Itâ s hard to believe that in a world where Monetâ s Water Lilies are printed onto tea towels and where paintings by Cezanne fetch hundreds of millions of dollars at auction Impressionism was once shunned by the art world With dynamic full room projections floating video screens and a geo located headset narrative the exhibition recounts how a group of renegade artists revolutionised painting and re taught us to look Itâ s also a sensory immersion into the works themselves â you wonâ t ever get as close to standing inside an Impressionist painting as you can here Projections as part of The Impressionist Vision exhibition at ChÃ teau dâ Auvers sur Oise Â Institut Van Gogh Back in time Auversâ small museums and historical sites layer this grand narrative with vivid personal touches The Maison Atelier Daubigny is the former home of Auversâ original great artist Charles FranÃ ois Daubigny a celebrated pre Impressionist who lived here from until his death in With its internal walls covered with charming murals by Daubigny his children and artist friends Corot and Daumier it offers another kind of immersion into how artists lived here and a charming back in time experience Vincent was a frequent guest of his friend Dr Gachet at what is now the Maison Docteur Gachet painting numerous works in the garden as well as portraits of the doctor himself A fascinating character well before his time Gachet was an art lover and early supporter of the Impressionists who also had a fascination with the diagnosis and treatment of nervous illnesses he was one of the first to experiment with electro shock therapy in his Paris clinic At the time absinthe was the chosen tipple of the Paris bohemian set with the drink copping the blame for the erratic emotional lives of several artists For his part Vincent was teetotal during his Auvers days having sworn off drinking after the breakdown in Provence that led to his hospitalisation However the townâ s MusÃ e dâ Absinthe charts the drinkâ s trajectory from life of the Belle Ã poque party to a feared and banned passport to insanity through vintage advertising posters cartoons and of course artworks In the museumâ s lovely courtyard you can sample the now legal drink in the traditional way with water dripped from an antique absinthe fountain The graves of Vincent van Gogh and his brother Theo sit side by side at the cemetery Auvers sur Oise Â Janine Eberle Lonely Planet A little cemetery outside Auvers Auvers sur Oise fate was changed forever by the violent death of the strange foreign painter in the summer of The incident only received a minor mention in the local paper as Van Gogh was still unknown outside of artistic circles That would change in with his first solo show in Paris In the following decades the genius of his vision and the tragic story of his life and death became legend His humble resting place in the tiny cemetery just beyond the town brings the pilgrimage to a poignant end His simple headstone sits cheek to cheek with that of his brother Theo who died just six months after him Ivy weaves a blanket over the two graves binding them together in this tiny graveyard surrounded by the fields that Vincent had brought to life for those intense last few weeks Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real France Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers Everywhere Follow
