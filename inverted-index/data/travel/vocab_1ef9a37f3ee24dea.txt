there from to More than names are listed in all Photograph by Audra Melton New York Times Redux TRAVEL As statues get torn down which monuments should we visit No monument is perfect but historians say these six U S memorials rise above all others By Amy Thomas August min read Monuments are under scrutiny throughout the United States Dozens of contentious statues including those depicting Christopher Columbus founding fathers such as Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and Confederate soldiers have been removed by local governments or torn down by protesters since George Floyd s death in May sparked a national reckoning on race Although calls for change were sounded long before this moment the current movement has led to honest conversations about how the history of colonialization slavery and white supremacy is taught and viewed especially through statues and memorials Related As monuments fall how does the world reckon with a racist past Despite the controversy and the ongoing pandemic many travelers are still making monuments part of their travel plans According to a June survey conducted by tourism consultancy Longwoods International percent of Americans indicated they planned to visit either a monument or state or national park this summer Paul Farber co founder of Philadelphia s Monument Lab which pushes for more inclusive histories and engagement of public space says we have a responsibility to if not take statues down at least offer fuller narratives that better reflect accurate history What we re seeing now is a reminder that monuments don t just serve the project of remembrance they reinforce power and possibility in the present says Farber No monument is permanent in and of itself it requires maintenance and mindsets to keep it up While travelers can t change the past they can alter how they view and talk about history and be part of the conversation of who should get placed on the pedestals Here are six memorials recommended by historians that are well worth visiting Tower of Reconciliation Tulsa Oklahoma Why it matters In the state of Oklahoma commissioned Ed Dwight American sculptor and first African American astronaut trainee to honor the more than Black people killed in the Tulsa Race Massacre The foot tall Tower of Reconciliation sits within the city s John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park and depicts scenes of Black Oklahomans from their African origins to present day including the forced relocation of slaves and Native Americans by the federal government If you re going to visit a statue or monument you

bronze figures representing Hostility Humiliation and Hope The figures are based on actual people photographed prior to the Tulsa race riot Photograph by Amy Harris The Robert Gould Shaw and Massachusetts Regiment Memorial Boston Massachusetts Why it matters While most Civil War monuments honor the Confederacy this century bronze monument actually recognizes the work and contribution of Black troops to the United States during the Civil War says Sarah Beetham an academic at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts who studies the impermanence of monuments The regiment which was featured in the Oscar winning movie Glory was one of the first documented Black voluntary infantry units formed to fight in the war The monument took sculptor Augustus Saint Gaudens years to complete and depicts the soldiers heading to South Carolina to fight a major battle at Fort Wagner Related African American veteran faced hostility abroad and at home A Quest for Parity Philadelphia Pennsylvania Why it matters To me one of the most special monuments is the Octavius Catto monument says Farber The century freedom fighter and educator was shot and killed on Election Day as white rioters attempted to silence the Black vote The foot tall bronze figure of Catto now stands behind a voting box in the memorial titled A Quest for Parit y Installed in it stands as the first solo African American statue on public ground in Philadelphia Related For Black women the Amendment didn t end their fight to vote Yellow Mounds Overlook Badlands South Dakota Why it matters Societies want to create spaces that are intended to take you out of your present condition your present state of mind and prompt you to reflect says Fitz Brundage a professor of history at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill There s a kind of ritual dimension to these spaces Natural landscapes such as the Yellow Mounds Overlook are considered hallowed to Indigenous people who were stewards of this
