How to Bike Across America TRAVEL How to Bike Across America National Geographic Travel photographer Tyler Metcalfe recently quit his job and sold off his possessions Now he s setting off on the American Bike Project an epic solo adventure of cross country cycling that will take him miles across the United States By Tyler Metcalfe April min read National Gallery of Art Tyler Metcalfe pedals in front of the National Gallery of Art in Washington D C Video by Tyler Metcalfe Two years ago National Geographic Digital Nomad Robert Reid wrote an article called Are Bikes the New Tour Bus Robert argues that bikes are the best way to see a city noting that biking is more fun than public transit quicker than walking and cheaper than taxis or renting a car not to mention better for the environment Over the years I have adopted the same sentiment However I say why stop at the city limits In recent years I have come across a number of people who have decided to travel across states countries and even continents by bike The stories they tell paint bike travel as a fascinating way to see our world and though bike touring is nothing new National Geographic published an article on bike touring in there s been a rise in interest lately And now I m joining in After spending the last two and a half years working at the headquarters of National Geographic I ve decided to quit my job sell most of my possessions and bike miles across the country on the TransAmerica bike trail The trail was established by the Adventure Cycling Association in and is celebrating its th anniversary so there will be plenty of buzz along the way The route passes through states three national parks and covers a diverse landscape that reflects the heart of America I have spent the last two months planning for the journey and today I ll be setting out from Washington D C to begin pedaling until I reach the West Coast Though I can t yet give advice on how to accomplish such a journey I have collected plenty of tips from those who have Map by Jon Bowen Do Your Research Though the day to day of riding a bike across the country sounds routine wake up bike eat sleep repeat the scale of such a journey can require a good bit of planning Where will I sleep What is the safest route for a cyclist How much gear should I take There are a number of websites and organizations that host a wealth of information specific to bicycle tourists CouchSurfing com and WarmShowers org for example provide a surprising number of options for travelers and bicycle tourists looking to stay in a welcoming home while traveling Not only are these places free but more often than not the hosts have taken similar journeys and are looking to give back to the travel community Adventure Cycling Organization another bike centric organization has mapped more than miles of routes specific to bicycle touring Their maps come in print and digital form are easy to read and feature waterproof coatings Finally there are a number of blogs and video series from cross country cyclists Bicycle touring pro Darren Alff has been one of my go to sources via his book The Bicycle Traveler s Blueprint and his YouTube videos on the basics of bike travel Commit Before You Feel Ready As much as you can plan for a long trip you will never feel fully prepared Last month I attended a lecture by National Geographic explorer Sarah Marquis who spent three years walking alone though the landscapes of Mongolia China and Australia She learned to live off the land and survived a handful of extremely uncomfortable situations so I assume she knows a thing or two about preparing for a long journey Her biggest piece of advice Commit to the journey just before you feel fully ready According to her and many other like minded travelers you will never feel completely prepared when it comes to embarking on a journey of such a large scale Major details can be crucial for trips like these but flexibility is key too With an open mind and flexibility detouring for a few days in order to purchase a forgotten item or repair a broken part becomes just another part of the journey If you try and plan every single detail of a long trip before you leave your idea will start to collect cobwebs and you ll eventually talk yourself out of taking the plunge National Geographic Expeditions Travel with National Geographic Search Trips Memories Weigh Less Than Luggage After committing to the idea of biking across the country I decided to sell most of my possessions and permanently move out of my apartment I don t know how long I will be on the road and am open to continuing the adventure upon reaching the West Coast so I wanted the freedom of being unencumbered Packing light is essential for a trip like this and I plan to bring only the essentials As Alff says in The Bicycle Traveler s Blueprint You don t need half the things you think you ll need As someone who has traveled often but only once checked baggage on a flight I know the game of packing efficiently In my opinion you get more out of traveling when you have the physical freedom to move easily from place to place Let s Go Follow along in the coming months as I ride my bike miles across America I ll be pedaling through states three national parks and countless landscapes and reporting the stories I find along the way I ll be updating my story here and on Twitter as well as posting images to the natgeotravel Instagram account and my personal Instagram feed tylermetcalfe Related Topics BIKING TRAVEL WORK You May Also Like
