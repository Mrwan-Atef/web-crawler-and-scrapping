min read Share Experience the best of the beautiful multicultural city of Auckland with our guide to the top things to do Janice Chen Shutterstock Situated on a narrow strip of land between the west coast and Hauraki Gulf Auckland is arguably one of New Zealand s most geographically blessed cities Within the city limits there are around volcanoes dozens of islands and countless beaches It s also the country s most populous city with over million people calling it home All that mingling of people and topology makes Auckland a place worthy of your time You can spend a day or two seeing the major attractions but there s also plenty to see and do in Auckland beyond the city center Advertisement To discover the best parts of the city consider hiring a car and hitting some of the places where locals love to hang out Here are the top things to do in Auckland Learn about MÄ ori culture on Mt Eden Maungawhau One of the major attractions in Auckland is Mt Eden or Maungawhau â one of the cityâ s approximately dormant volcanoes and a protected archaeological site that s both historically and spiritually significant to MÄ ori Itâ s an easy if steep walk up to the summit where the hill abruptly disappears into a remarkable crater While most visitors amble along the grassy banks of the crater and admire sweeping views from its rim you can also join a hÄ koi MÄ ori walking tour for a special insight into this sacred place bringing the mountain and its history to life while learning more about MÄ ori culture Take a yoga class on top of the Sky Tower The Sky Tower dominates the skyline and is a distinctive feature of the city Offering panoramic views of Auckland and its harbor going up the Sky Tower is one of the most popular tourist activities in Auckland For a unique experience â and to visit at one of the quietest times â head up early in the morning for a yoga class on the observation level On clear days you can watch the sun rise over the Hauraki Gulf and see the nearby islands silhouetted against the morning sky Itâ s a serene way to see the city Local tip If yoga isnâ t your thing you can visit the Sky Tower during the day of course or experience the views from the revolving restaurant More adventurous visitors can take a walk around the building s edge or even jump from it Auckland s night markets are a great place to shop and try dishes from around the world Getty Images Discover Aucklandâ s night markets For a glimpse into some of Aucklandâ s diverse cultures visit a night market Held at different locations around the city they usually happen in undercover venues often car parks and are all weather events The markets are busy and vibrant with eclectic stalls live performances and the mingling scents of different cuisines Planning tip Food is the main draw so go hungry and taste different dishes from around the world There is always a wide range of Asian food on offer â be sure to try the dumplings â and usually a mix of other flavors as well including some Western staples and delicious desserts Head to Auckland s ferry terminal and get out on the harbor AsiaTravel Shutterstock Take a ferry to Devonport From the city itâ s only a minute ferry ride to Aucklandâ s North Shore and the charming suburb of Devonport The ferry itself gives visitors an opportunity to see the city from the water and gain an appreciation for the number of boats in the harbor â Auckland is called â the city of sailsâ for a reason Advertisement When you arrive in Devonport walk along the coast past the Navy Museum and up North Head or Maungauika one of Aucklandâ s many volcanoes which juts out into the harbor From here youâ ll find stunning views of the city and Rangitoto Island North Head also houses a network of historic tunnels and military defenses built during WWII On your way back to Devonport explore the colonial village and pick a local restaurant for lunch â there are a few good options to choose from Hike up a volcano on Rangitoto Island Aucklandâ s youngest volcano rose from the sea some years ago and its dark cone is easily visible from much of the city Now dormant Rangitoto Island is a scenic reserve just a minute ferry ride from the city making it an easy option for a day trip Hiking to the summit is the most popular activity on the island and the trail only takes about an hour winding through native bush before reaching the top with spectacular views of the Hauraki Gulf If you d prefer a longer hike there are a number of other trails on the island including a route to nearby Motutapu Island that s only available at low tide Planning tip Remember to wear sturdy shoes apply sunscreen and bring food and drink with you â there are no shops on the island Muriwai Beach offer opportunities to spot wildlife as well as take beautiful sunset pictures Nazar Abbas Photography Getty Images Watch the sunset at Muriwai Beach Some of Auckland s most remarkable beaches known for their rugged landscapes rough surf and sparkling black sand are found on the West Coast about a minute drive from the city center Muriwai is a favorite with a long dark beach that stretches far into the distance The black sand can get very hot during the day â late afternoon is a cooler time to visit If visiting between August and March arrive a little before sunset and walk up the cliff to see the gannet colony Catch a peek at the seals and the occasional shark visible in the waves Then as the sun begins to dip head onto the beach and walk along the water The setting sun is reflected on the waves and the dark sand â the effect is mesmerizing and somewhat otherworldly Planning tip If youâ re tempted to swim be aware that the currents are very strong so be cautious especially as lifeguards usually leave in the late afternoon Taste local seafood at the Auckland Fish Market For a taste of local seafood head to the Fish Market in Wynyard Quarter in the city Take your pick from the eateries and enjoy fresh fish the way you like it best whether thatâ s sashimi poke bowls lobster rolls or traditional fish and chips Enjoy your food outside at a seat in the sunshine and on the weekends youâ ll often be treated to live music After youâ ve finished eating stroll through nearby Silo Park where youâ ll find events in summer and a playground where little ones can burn off some energy Ponsonby is a popular area to drink dine and shop Hoppers Garden Bar Brett Atkinson for Lonely Planet Head to Ponsonby Road for shopping food and drinks If you enjoy shopping head to Ponsonby just outside the city center and spend an afternoon strolling down Ponsonby Road Lined with shops cafes and restaurants the street showcases local designers and boutiques with a few chain stores thrown in Planning tip Ponsonby Road really comes alive in the evenings so hang around for cocktails after the shops close The bars fill up quickly with a mostly local crowd and the people watching is excellent If you end up staying out a bit longer there are some lovely places to go for dinner Hike to a waterfall in the Hunua Ranges New Zealand is known for its lush forests and natural features and Auckland is no exception If you enjoy the outdoors go hiking in the Hunua Ranges about an hour southeast of the city center There are two waterfall trails the Hunua Falls loop walk minutes return and the more strenuous Cossey Massey loop three hours plus which takes you up through a reservoir and back via a creek both good places for a swim Both trails meander through the native bush with ferns dappled sunlight and huge ancient trees Take a picnic and have lunch by the waterfall or beside the river Local tip Remember to clean your shoes carefully at the stations before entering the forest to help prevent the spread of kauri dieback disease which can kill the local kauri trees Take a guided tour of Auckland Harbour Bridge Linda Mckie Getty Images Climb up or bungee jump from the Harbour Bridge True to its name Auckland Harbour Bridge sweeps across the harbor connecting central Auckland to the North Shore The bridge is only open to cars and doesnâ t usually allow for pedestrian access however adventurous visitors can take a guided tour to the summit where they ll be rewarded with spectacular views of the city â a great activity for those who want to see Auckland from a different vantage point Itâ s a steep climb along dedicated walkways and it can get very windy as you climb up Seeking a more intense adrenalin rush You can also bungee jump from the bridge Eat fish and chips on the beach Eating fish and chips on the beach on a summer evening is a quintessential Auckland experience There are many beaches to choose from and almost all of them have a small fish and chip shop somewhere close by Expect your fish to come battered unless you ask for it crumbed with a large scoop of chips all wrapped up in paper Planning tip Fish and chips followed by an after dinner stroll along the sand is an extremely popular thing to do on Friday nights with beaches like Mission Bay and Takapuna Beach getting particularly vibrant during the summer months Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local
