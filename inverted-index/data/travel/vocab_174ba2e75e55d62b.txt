price tag around Christmas New Year s and spring break when airline hotel and car rental rates skyrocket During spring break â usually around March â hordes of college students descend on the megaresorts for wild fiestas in the beach clubs bars and thumping discos giving the city an overcrowded and boozy anything goes vibe For quieter and more affordable times come during the low season months of May June September and October CancÃºn offers tons of budget friendly food options away from the big resorts Erin Drewitz Photography Shutterstock Eat like a local in atmospheric markets and taco joints To get some serious bang for your buck not to mention authentic eats that would have made Anthony Bourdain smile hit the downtown market stalls and moderately priced restaurants

nighttime wrap your fingers around the al pasto r spit cooked marinated pork tacos at TaquerÃ a CoapeÃ itos or get some munchies at hotel zone hole in the wall Surfin Burrito Catch the economical airport bus Upon arrival at the CancÃºn International Airport look for the red ADO buses that run frequently from the terminals to the downtown bus station They cost about a third of what the airport taxis charge but they donâ t go to the hotel zone â you ll have to take an airport shuttle if you re staying on that side of town Stay in downtown or a hotel zone hostel Many budget conscious travelers like to stay in the hostels guesthouses and hotels clustered around downtown s Parque de las Palapas Avenida YaxchilÃ n and the ADO bus station in the heart of the Centro Advertisement Tried and true faves include Nomads a convivial hostel sporting a rooftop bar and pool or Hotel NÃ der which has great low season rates for its impeccably spacious rooms Lodging food and transportation tend to cost less in the downtown area Nevertheless it s possible to find several reasonably priced digs in the hotel zone Mayan Monkey and Hostel Natura put you within stumbling distance of the party zone but book ahead as rooms and dorm beds go fast CancÃºn is surrounded by several gorgeous and affordable cenotes Iren Key Shutterstock Plunge into inexpensive cenotes In CancÃºn s outlying areas youâ ll

activity and equipment needed The bulk of them are fairly budget friendly considering that you can easily spend a half day frolicking in otherworldly natural wonders Spend in Mexican pesos and use fee free credit cards Most hotels and restaurants will gladly accept US dollars but with the caveat that you probably won t get a great exchange rate Even cab drivers typically charge more when quoting fares in US dollars â whenever possible pay with Mexican pesos When using plastic take into account that you may get hit with foreign transaction fees for ATM withdrawals and debit card purchases Some major credit cards have no transaction fees making them the smartest payment option if you want to save money CancÃºn s ATMs dispense Mexican pesos Hop on the bus for the cheapest ride in town CancÃºn s city buses cost a fraction of what you would pay for taxis plus you eliminate the hassle of having to negotiate overpriced cab fares Lines R R and R run about every minutes between downtown and the hotel zone allowing you to zip back and forth with ease between the beaches and CancÃºn Centro R stops at the ADO first class bus station along downtown s main drag Avenida Tulum and then it follows a route through the L shaped hotel zone a barrier island spanning about miles Pile into shared vans to explore CancÃºn s outlying areas Locals often get around CancÃºn and its surrounding areas in low cost shared vans known as colectivos and it makes perfect sense once you see how convenient and relatively affordable they are To reach downtown s Isla Mujeres ferry terminal hail a Puerto JuÃ rez colectivo from a stop across from the ADO bus station Isla Mujeres makes for an easy day trip from CancÃºn and the scenic minute crossing won t break the bank To reach the Riviera Maya beach towns south of CancÃºn air conditioned Playa Express vans are cheaper and faster than most buses and they ll drop you off at any point along the highway including the turnoff to the underrated Puerto Morelos The vans depart from a parking lot in the ADO station Cancun s warm turquoise Caribbean waters and white sand beaches are a gorgeous way for tourists to relax George Wirt Shutterstock Find out why the best things in CancÃºn are free We might be going out on a limb here but we re guessing that beach time sits high on your CancÃºn to do list and as it costs absolutely nada we have a few additional tips for you If you re traveling with children hit the hotel zone s north facing beaches such as Playa Las Perlas and Playa Langosta where the calm swimmer friendly waters feel more like a lake Alternatively the beaches hugging the east shore such as Playa MarlÃ n and eco friendly Playa DelfÃ nes may have strong undercurrents but the Caribbean Sea along the coastline is downright breathtaking For a cool stroll walk about miles north of Playa MarlÃ n to the weathered remains of Yamil Lu um a small Maya structure known as the Scorpion s Temple Used as a place of worship by maritime settlers from to CE the ancient ruins stand in stark contrast to the backdrop of sleek hotels Any other ways to pinch pesos Many hotels apartments and guesthouses in CancÃºn come with full kitchens allowing you to reduce travel expenses by self catering In some hotels children can stay for free while various attractions long distance buses and ferries provide discounted prices for kids
