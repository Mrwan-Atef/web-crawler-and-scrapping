Roughly translated they read At you are merely a youth At if your ancestors invite you into heaven ask them to wait until you are then you might consider it That s not bluster At the latest count of Ogimi s villagers are centenarians One hundred and seventy one are in their Even in Japan which currently has more than people aged or over that s a remarkable statistic Haru Miyagi a widow whose

village of longevity Photograph by Alessandro Gandolfi Parallelozero Insititute Before COVID travelers were beginning to take notice Masataka Nozato at Ogimi Village Office says the town far removed from the tourist trail had started to see a slight increase in visitors curious about Okinawan longevity An island located south of mainland Japan Okinawa is one of five places around the world that author and National Geographic explorer Dan Buettner calls a blue zone where he says people live the longest happiest lives Others include Sardinia Italy Nicoya Costa Rica Ikaria Greece and Loma Linda California Though travel to Okinawa and any blue zone is on hold for many these towns offer lessons about surviving and thriving during difficult times such as a pandemic Every longevity culture in the world suffered periods of hardships Buettner told TODAY They went through wars famines the same sorts of stresses that we re suffering right now and that s a lesson for all of us Misako Miyagi is merely a youth according to a saying in Ogimi where there is a high concentration of centenarians Photograph by Alessandro Gandolfi Parallelozero Insititute What can Okinawans tell us Why does Ogimi and elsewhere on the island have a history of long life That comes down to three main factors diet social practices and genetics explains Craig Willcox a professor of public health and gerontology at Okinawa International University and a co principal investigator of the Okinawa Centenarian Study which has been investigating Okinawan longevity since About two thirds of longevity is related to diet and way of life the rest is genetics Generally speaking you need the genetic rocket booster if you want to get into the hundreds not just a good diet Willcox says We haven t looked into whether or not Okinawa has a genetic advantage over other parts of Japan but longevity does run in families here Food as medicine Genetics aside diet more easily identifies how locals stand apart If you go to a typical Okinawa themed restaurant in Tokyo or a touristy one in Okinawa the menu is pork heavy and the alcohol is as strong as it gets in Japan Awamori the fiery regional spirit weighs in at an ABV of percent But that s not representative of island habits Chouju zen or longevity food is nutritionally dense yet light in calories which some say contributes to long life Photograph by Alessandro

for their village Photograph by Alessandro Gandolfi Parallelozero Insititute Related Here s the ultimate three day itinerary for exploring Tokyo In terms of preventing cancer and cardiovascular disease the Okinawan diet gives more than five servings a day of fruits and vegetables and incorporates more heart healthy fish than meat says Willcox There s an Okinawan phrase nuchi gusui which can translate as let food be your medicine he notes The sweet potatoes bitter melon carotenoid rich marine foods like seaweeds green leafy vegetables and fruit in the diet are anti aging as they reduce inflammation and oxidative stress The traditional Okinawan diet is also nutritionally dense yet calorie poor and that s ideal Willcox continues adding that sweet potato rather than white rice was the staple in Okinawa up until the If you calorie restrict mammals in a lab they live longer pretty much across the board he says A persistent energy deficit triggers a self preservation mode you adapt to convert a higher proportion of food into usable energy and turn on enzymes that promote longevity Residents in Naha Okinawa also tend to enjoy long lives filled with social outings Photograph by Alessandro Gandolfi Parallelozero Insititute Looking after each other Life on the islands is different from much of the rest of Japan The climate is sub tropical with mild winters Okinawans live amid scenic island beauty and have a reputation for being mellow the laidback approach to punctuality here is known as Okinawa time Society is structured so older residents retain purpose or ikigai in their lives Giving some in Ogimi an ikigai is the local craft of weaving basho fu textiles where the time intensive cleaning of fibers and spooling of thread is done by groups of older women It s not just a way to remain socially active it gives the weavers a way to supplement their income and contribute to the village economy Naturally the basho fu center is run by a year old from a family full of centenarians In Ogimi nature abounds offering stress free living amid scenic beauty Photograph by Alessandro Gandolfi Parallelozero Insititute Then there s the way society stresses mutual support through moai This Okinawan social mechanism brings groups of people with a shared interest together allowing them to develop emotional connections Buettner says that s a crucial element to living a

in Okinawa as of October many moai are adapting The new moai normal emphasizes face masks hand sanitizers and avoiding what the government calls the three Cs closed spaces close contact settings and
