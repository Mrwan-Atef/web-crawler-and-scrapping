Taiwan eSIMs wi fi and mobile networks Tom O Malley Mar min read Share National Chiang Kai shek Memorial Hall in Taipei Alamy Stock Photo Taiwan the beautiful isle is a land of natural wonder electric cities and layers of fascinating culture One of Asia â s most progressive societies itâ s also one of its most tech forward a global leader in advanced chips and semiconductors that power everything from smartphones to satellites Chances are the device you re reading this on has a little bit of Taiwan inside And when it comes to connectivity Taiwan is no slouch Unlike mainland China across the strait Taiwan doesnâ t censor its internet behind a Great Firewall or block certain apps meaning all the tools you might need for a great trip â Google Maps Instagram Uber Google Translate and whatever else â are openly accessible So hereâ s everything you need to know about getting connected in Taiwan from local cell phone networks to the best eSIM providers Beitou hot springs near Taipei TkKurikawa Getty Images Will my phone work in Taiwan Yes modern smartphones should work without a hitch in Taiwan but roaming with a US carrier can get expensive pretty quickly The likes of Verizon AT T and T Mobile charge eye watering rates for Pay As You Go calls messages and data in Taiwan And be aware that data usage mounts up faster than you think One gigabyte might last a couple of days if youâ re just checking locations on Google Maps looking things up online and sending messages and emails but if you plan to stream movies and TV shows or upload reams of photos and videos itâ ll be gone in a flash Advertisement At the very least youâ ll want to purchase an international roaming package such as Verizonâ s TravelPass which for Taiwan costs US per day plus tax Do the math though and a few days in the country adds up to a hefty outlay If your phone is unlocked options like local SIM cards or international eSIMs such as Saily or Airalo can be a much smarter cheaper investment What mobile networks are available in Taiwan Taiwan has three major mobile networks Chunghwa Telecom Taiwan Mobile and FarEasTone Chunghwa Telecom the biggest and most established provider which also has the widest coverage extending to cover remote wilderness regions FarEasTone considered the top player in terms of coverage especially in Taipei and other cities Taiwan Mobile the second largest network overall strong in urban centers and with some of the fastest and most reliable speeds across the country Thereâ s nothing to choose between the three carriers when it comes to costs and packages for prepaid SIM cards for short term visitors All sell cards at both and speeds and you can select coverage that offers unlimited data over three to days Prices start at NT US for a three or five day prepaid SIM with unlimited data up to NT US for a day card with speed and unlimited data These cards generally also include a small amount of local call credit for making calls within Taiwan The National Palace Museum Taipei Avigator Fortuner Shutterstock How can I get a local SIM card All three mobile networks have sales counters at Taoyuan International Airport TPE Taiwanâ s main hub and the arrival point for most international flights Youâ ll also find kiosks at Songshan TSA and Kaohsiung KHH airports English speaking staff can help you set up your SIM on the spot You can also preorder a SIM online using third party service providers like KKday and collect it at the airport Itâ s generally best to grab a SIM card at the airport since the registration process requires your passport You can do it later by popping into a store run by one of the three mobile carriers but English language levels might vary wait times could be longer and you might also be required to provide two forms of ID passport and driving license for example which could be a hassle Convenience stores arenâ t a good bet since they mostly sell prepaid SIMs for residents which require local ID or an ARC Alien Resident Certificate Once your new SIM is activated check the data is working before you hightail it out of there and start your trip Your phone number is usually on the back of your SIM card packaging â write it down or add it to your phone contacts list so you can share it with people you know Is eSIM available in Taiwan and how does it work A more straightforward solution and one you can take care of before you fly is getting an eSIM Taiwanâ s mobile networks donâ t generally provide eSIMs for short term visitors but the country is fully compatible with international eSIM services Advertisement eSIMs offer a few advantages to a physical SIM It can be bought anywhere even before you leave home so you have access as soon as you land There s no passport fingerprint or address required You don t need to remove your current SIM You can use several carriers and phone numbers at once If you run out of data it s easy to add more They re available on some smartphones tablets and watches Getting an eSIM is a great time saver since you can set it up before your trip and avoid hanging around in the airport arrivals fiddling with phones and SIM cards when youâ ve just stepped off a flight Another advantage is that your eSIM will be working as soon as youâ ve landed meaning you can get connected without delay let loved ones know youâ ve arrived safely organize your onward journey and move on from the airport hassle free There is a range of eSIM providers out there but Lonely Planet recommends Saily as our eSIM partner for Taiwan As well as offering a wide variety of eSIM packages â starting at just US for for seven days but going up to for days â Sailyâ s eSIMs come with enhanced security features such as the ability to change your virtual location and block ads and tracking services Use code to receive percent off your Saily mobile data plan Sun Moon Lake central Taiwan Jack Hong Shutterstock Where can I find reliable wi fi in Taiwan Thereâ s a number of places you can find wi fi in Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport provides free wi fi service in its public areas meaning you can get online pretty much as soon as you transition from the airplane cabin to the arrivals terminal Trains and stations on Taiwan High Speed Rail THSR offer free wi fi and the same goes for Taoyuan Metro and the Taoyuan Airport MRT When youâ re out and about looks for free public wi fi at coffee chains like Starbucks convenience stores and at major tourist attractions like the National Palace Museum in Taipei Hotels and guesthouses all typically offer free wi fi for guests and visitors and look out for iTaiwan free wi fi hot spots a government scheme with locations all over the country When using public wi fi in Taiwan take care if sending or receiving sensitive information such as when using online banking or entering passwords If you need to send sensitive data consider using your phone data instead or connecting via a Virtual Private Network VPN to ensure you re secure How fast and reliable is the internet Unsurprisingly for such a tech loving nation internet speeds and reliability are towards the top end of global standards In the Speedtest Global Index a ranking of internet speeds by country Taiwan comes in at a very respectable in the world for fixed broadband performance and for mobile Are there any internet restrictions or censorship laws No progressive Taiwan has a notably free and open online environment Freedom House a nonprofit that conducts research and advocacy on political freedom and human rights reports that Taiwan â hosts one of the freest online environments in Asiaâ with an information landscape characterized by â affordable internet access diverse content and a lack of website blocks or internet shutdownsâ Cihmu Bridge in Taroko Gorge Matt Munro Lonely Planet Can I stay connected at major tourist sites Yes major tourist attractions in Taipei including the National Palace Museum and Chiang Kai shek Memorial Hall offer free public wi fi Off the beaten track in places like Taroko Gorge head to the nearest tourist information office or visitor center to get connected Will I encounter language barriers when getting connected Levels of spoken English in Taiwan are generally good especially among the young and the three main network providers have hour customer hotlines in English so itâ s unlikely youâ ll run into any insurmountable language barriers and youâ ll be absolutely fine if purchasing and setting up a SIM in Taoyuan Airport How much does it cost to stay connected in Taiwan Taiwanâ s three mobile networks have pretty much identical pricing on their products and all offer unlimited data at either cheaper or with the price varying depending on the number of days either three five seven or days The cheapest option is three days of for NT US while seven days of costs NT US and days comes in at NT US International eSIM providers including Saily tend to charge for units of data rather than offer unlimited use For light users or those on a longer trip this can be economical seven days with a limit costs just US while over days costs US Wi fi passes arenâ t really an option in Taiwan but iTaiwan hosts free wi fi hot spots at locations like tourist information centers visitor centers transport hubs and other public areas all over the country Tai chi at the Confucius Temple in the southern city of Tainan Matt Munro Lonely Planet What local tech customs or etiquette should I be aware of Taiwanese phone etiquette is generally polite though speakerphone use is fairly common especially among older generations On public transport it s expected that passengers set their phones to silent mode When it comes to messaging LINE is by far the most popular app used for everything from texting and voice calls to following official accounts for businesses and services Taiwanâ s trains and long distance buses are equipped with USB charging ports and power sockets Taiwan uses a standard voltage of at and the most common plug type is Type A two flat parallel pins like in the US though you ll also find three pronged Type B How do I contact emergency services if needed In an emergency use the following numbers Police Fire and ambulance Operators may not always speak English but Taiwan has a dedicated hour tourist hotline with English speaking staff who can assist in emergencies If calling from a mobile you may need to dial Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email
