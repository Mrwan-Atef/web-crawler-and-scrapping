grasp its grandeur until you walk through it Finché non ci cammini dentro non capisci la sua maestosità Another must visit stop You should set aside at least half a day to stroll leisurely through the

DON T OVERPAY Through the National Park Service site you can get tickets which include ferry ride to the Statue and Ellis Island and access to the pedestal and or crown for under This is the ONLY boat

extra to go up seriously but you have to be able to climb a lot of stairs The best part of climbing up is being able to see the inside of the statue But be aware as you get higher it gets hotter Take
