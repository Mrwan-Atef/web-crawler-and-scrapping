T shaped path linking New York City to the Adirondacks and Albany to Buffalo is the longest multi use rail trail in the United States It s emblematic of the state s push to encourage residents to get outdoors and improve their health The trail also aims to reconnect communities many in rural areas which have become increasingly isolated According to Andy Beers director of the EST the million project which secured another million in grant funding after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo championed it in is the single largest state investment in trails anywhere in the country It s also inextricably linked with rail history Once the lifeblood of New York State railroads drove economic and community growth through the Industrial era mainly during the in the U S Following the proliferation of the automobile in the early century many railroads folded In New York State boasted miles of railway Today only miles remain Of the numerous abandoned corridors Beers says They ve

center It sweeps through many of the state s iconic landscapes from the historic river towns of the Hudson Valley to the Catskill Mountains the manicured cities of the Erie Canalway and the shrouded
