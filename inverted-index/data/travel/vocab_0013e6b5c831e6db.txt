Tankerton near Whitstable Melinda Nagy Shutterstock With a nickname as evocative as the Garden of England Kent begs to be explored Often viewed by visitors to Great Britain as a blur of countryside from the windows of the Eurostar or a distant patch of green from planes descending into London this corner of the UK isnâ t merely somewhere to be passed through Its proximity to northern Europe made it strategically important for centuries though these days Kentâ s gentle hills and crystalline coast couldnâ t be more welcoming At its heart is the splendid Canterbury Cathedral and from there the county opens up into a lovely collection of pretty seaside towns historic estates gregarious breweries rolling vineyards and handsome castles Here are the best things to do in Kent Advertisement Wheelers Oyster Bar in Whitstable Alla Tsyganova Shutterstock Try oysters in Whitstable The coast of England has a rich gastronomic canvas and on Whitstableâ s slice of Kentâ s northern shores itâ s all about oysters Alongside the likes of Wheelers Oyster Bar and Whitstable Oyster Company plenty of dining options serve plates of tender and sustainably caught rock oysters though the most satisfying might be found at the Lobster Shack Ignore its crustacean heavy name and head out onto the wind blasted harbor arm where you can dine al fresco with a plate of silky smooth oysters and a glass of wine or beer Thereâ s even a view of Whitstableâ s oyster farms themselves Beyond those meaty mollusks Whitstable itself is a charming spot with a community museum some independent bookshops Tankerton Beachâ s colorful huts and a Georgian castle Planning tip Pair your oysters with a local wine if possible more on that below See a spectacular and infamous cathedral Canterbury has a population barely above but this city in central Kent is arguably the most significant religious city in the UK The Archbishop of Canterbury is the spiritual leader of the Church of England and the majestic Canterbury Cathedral attracts thousands of visitors every month But the cathedralâ s association with the archbishop and its spectacular mix of Gothic and Romanesque architecture arenâ t the only reasons itâ s so well known More notoriously Canterbury Cathedral is the site where the then archbishop Thomas Beckett was murdered by knights of King Henry II in this incident lead to his posthumous canonization by Pope Alexander III The spot of Beckettâ s martyrdom within the cathedral is marked by a striking sculpture by artist Giles Blomfield representing the knights four swords Tour Kentâ s modern vineyards Perhaps itâ s the proximity to France but Kent is one of Englandâ s strongest wine producing regions with over vineyards This county is also one of the warmest driest areas of the UK and its lime rich chalky soil the same mix found in the French Champagne region is ideal for wine especially chardonnay and pinot noir To sample a glass and pick up a bottle or two itâ s best to hop in a car and drop by the various vineyards flanking Kentâ s verdant hills and timbered villages Gusbourne Estate just south of Ashford Balfour Winery east of Royal Tunbridge Wells and the new Domaine Evremond near Canterbury give fantastic tours and tasting experiences Dover Min Jing Shutterstock Stroll along the iconic white cliffs The white chalk cliffs running north from the port of Dover are one of the most symbolic images of England Reaching a height of over the cliffs are even visible from the windows of aircraft let alone the ferries running between the UK and France Dover to Calais is the shortest point between the two countries at miles Advertisement Itâ s a blustery minute walk from the visitors center to the main viewpoint where there are cinematic views of the cliffs the English Channel and the distant French coast visible on clear days Walking another couple miles brings you to the chunky Victorian South Foreland Lighthouse once a setting for scientific experiments but now a quaint tearoom perfect for resting weary legs Detour The sprawling century Dover Castle is perhaps a little overshadowed by the famed cliffs but its fascinating history takes in medieval sieges to secret WWII tunnels Get arty in Margate Margate once epitomized the cheap British seaside holiday before sun filled package trips to Europe became a more desirable option Yet Margate has gone through a surprising reinvention evolving into a cool coastal art hub Start with the bright white Turner Contemporary near the shore where JMW Turner would stay during his trips to Margate Opened in the airy three floor space hosts revolving and thought provoking exhibitions while outside Anthony Gormleyâ s ethereal Another Time Another Place sculpture looks toward the distant horizon The winding streets of Margate s handsome Old Town are also packed with galleries so make time to drop by Carl Freedman Gallery Pie Factory and the Eclectic Art Gallery Learn about Winston Churchill at Chartwell Winston Churchill is one of the most recognizable Britons of the century Set in the Weald of Kentâ s bucolic countryside Chartwell Churchillâ s elegant home for over years is where the former prime minister did much of his writing and painting Many probably know Churchill through his speeches and photographs but Chartwell shows the great manâ s domestic life as well as the gardens and lakes he helped build and his painting box vast book collection and study Detour From the nearby village of Westerham a handsome pub filled spot of its own it is a pleasant mile walk to Chartwell Dungeness Shutterstock Discover an unusual landscape One of the largest expanses of shingle beach in Europe with tufts of sea kale growing among its caramel colored pebbles Dungeness gives the impression of a desolate desert scene While calling it Britainâ s only desert is a stretch thereâ s no doubt that this stark landscape on the south Kent coast is a compelling corner of the UK Look out for a few of the local landmarks including the Tanning Copper Monument two lighthouses a nuclear power station and one of the worldâ s smallest miniature public railways the Romney Hythe and Dymchurch Railway Plants birds and a huge array of insects make up the distinct wildlife here too Detour Nearby Greatstone Beach is a more conventional coastal scene with miles of golden sand Itâ s also a popular spot for kitesurfing land yachting and kiteboarding Go on a luxurious British safari Across hectares of countryside Port Lympne Hotel and Reserve is an impressive destination and its over animals include western lowland gorillas big cats black rhinos giraffes and Kentâ s only spectacled bears While youâ re are free to roam the parkâ s finely curated hour Land Rover safari tours with expert guides give visitors a far deeper insight into the species and the land What makes Port Lympne different from the usual zoo experience however is staying overnight at a four star turn of the century mansion with quality dining at the Garden Room restaurant formerly the mansionâ s stable yard Visit a rejuvenated theme park Originally opened in Margateâ s famous old amusement park has had a glorious revival in recent years after lying derelict and under threat of closure during the early part of the new century If you arrive in Margate at night the bright yellow letters of Dreamland s art deco cinema are a kitschy introduction but thereâ s a lot happening behind its doors Retro roller coasters arcade machines a roller disco and some quirky art installations make this a nostalgia filled day out Planning tip Dreamland also stages outdoor shows beneath its Ferris wheel throughout the summer Ahead of a visit to Kent check the schedule of live gigs in this arena Reculver Andrew Fletcher Shutterstock Take a windswept walk to a ruined church Two train stops east of bookish Whitstable Herne Bay is a more traditional English seaside town â rocks a long pier fish and chips â but itâ s also the launchpad for a cinematic coastal walk with a history spanning almost two millennia The Romans constructed a fort on nearby Reculverâ s wind whipped cliffs in the century and then several centuries later a church was built here in This eventually became St Maryâ s Church though the settlementâ s decline twinned with coastal erosion lead to the churchâ s decay into ruin These days its skeletal remains have a macabre majesty about them leading to a climactic mile walk east above the cliffs from Herne Bay Planning tip Herne Bay has some wonderful sunsets in the summer so stick around even if your accommodation is elsewhere Sip on beers from a historic brewery On a casual stumble around the traditional pubs of London or the South East youâ re bound to see colorful taps pouring Spitfire or Bishopâ s Finger These smooth ales are products of Shepherd Neame Britainâ s oldest brewer Founded in the brewery is located in the Kent market town of Faversham and its visitor center has fascinating minute tours delving into the science of the brewing process but also Shepherd Neameâ s long history including vintage delivery vehicles a recreated coopersâ workshop and some bygone pub signs And of course it ends with a convivial tasting of the breweryâ s Kentish ales and speciality lagers Detour About minutes south of Faversham is Curious Brewery in Ashford whose modern angular brewery is a dramatic contrast to Shepherd Neame Sample fresh IPAs pilsners and ciders in its sleek taproom and restaurant Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan
