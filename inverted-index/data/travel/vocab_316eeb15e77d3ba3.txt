Mar min read Share Here s how to visit Tuscany from Rome in a day Â Cavan Images Getty Images Want to travel from Rome to Tuscany on a day trip Lonely Planet writer Paula Hardy tells you how to make that happen Advertisement Lonely Planet writer Paula Hardy has been traveling researching and commissioning guides to Italy for years and she has contributed to guidebooks covering every Italian region Last year she was back in Rome and Florence researching for new pocket guidebooks Here she answers a reader s question about how to take a day trip from Rome to Tuscany Question On my upcoming trip I ll be visiting Rome for the first time but would love to see a bit more of Italy as well Is it possible to take a day trip to Tuscany from Rome Answer Yes you can do a day trip from Rome to Tuscany but be warned it will be a whistle stop tour After all Tuscany is one of Italyâ s blockbuster regions stuffed with medieval towns Renaissances art cities historic country castles world class vineyards gorgeous walking trails and unforgettable restaurants Itâ s hard to experience all that in day But if youâ ve only got a day and want a little taste of Tuscanyâ s bella vita good life it can be done First things first itâ s good to get an understanding of whatâ s where and consider exactly what kind of experience youâ d like Is seeing Florence non negotiable or do you want to get out into the countryside and sample some Tuscan wines Or would you rather visit unique medieval towns like San Gimignano and then linger over a long lunch instead Or do you want to see as many sights as possible and are happy with a picnic lunch en route These preferences all dictate quite different trips Advertisement The first step is deciding what you want from your time in Tuscany Â PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek Shutterstock Rome to Tuscany by car You can easily hire a car for a day in Rome and work out a self drive tour but bear in mind as a first time visitor navigating will take you more time and as a driver you wonâ t get to enjoy the views out the window in the same way Then thereâ s the eternal problem of parking in Tuscanyâ s tiny and often pedestrianized historic centers Alternatively you can book one of RomeCabs varied itineraries It offers a car and driver but youâ ll need to sort out and book your own lunch and you wonâ t have a tour guide â although an LP guidebook can help you there If you book onto a tour youâ ll be in a small group and will be riding in a minibus When assessing itineraries bear in mind distances and traveling time Pisa with its famous Leaning Tower and medieval Lucca with its historic walled center are hours and miles away from Rome Volterra Italyâ s oldest city and lovely Renaissance Florence are hours miles away as is San Gimignano with its sky scraping towers Terracotta colored Siena is a smidge closer at hours and minutes miles while the closest place of interest is the vineyard clad hills of the Val dâ Orcia with its famous wine towns of Montepulciano and Montalcino They are hours from Rome as is UNESCO heritage site Pienza a perfectly preserved century Tuscan town that features heavily on most day trip tours If youâ re envisioning lunch in a picturesque setting as a key part of your Tuscan dream then opt for an itinerary around Pienza and the Val dâ Orcia as this will give you enough time for a little cultural exploration in the morning a leisurely lunch and then some afternoon wine tasting before returning to Rome Walks of Italy has a great itinerary that includes lunch at a family run winery in Montepulciano Day long tours run from Rome to Tuscany that include wine tasting in Chianti Â Fani Kurti Getty Images Rome to Florence by train If Florence is a must see on your Tuscan tour then look out for a mixed train and car trip The high speed frecciarossa service from Rome to Florence takes just hours meaning you can be in the city by in time for coffee and croissant in art nouveau CaffÃ Gilli Youâ ll then head out into the countryside by car to visit either Siena San Gimignano or the wine country of Chianti Italy on a Budget has a very well priced tour that manages to cover all of them and includes lunch and a wine tasting If you can possibly spare another day for Tuscany Florence with reward you amply Youâ ll then have time to visit the spectacular Duomo Michelangeloâ s David and the Mediciâ s marble tombs Thereâ s also nothing better than toasting the sunset over the Arno River in rooftop bars like SE STO on Arno While the evening can be spent sampling wine at the Antinori palazzo or dining at exciting contemporary restaurants like Then you can head into the countryside the next day with Ariana at KM Zero Tours A Chianti native she creates fantastic small group tours to local farms cheesemakers and vineyards If the years Iâ ve spent researching in Italy for Lonely Planet have taught me anything itâ s that taking more time always pays off Instead of rushing a visit to Tuscany consider lingering at places nearer Rome Â Marco Bottigelli Getty Images An alternative day trip from Rome Finally Iâ d like to consider whether the main motivation behind your question is that youâ d just like to venture outside Rome and see some of the fabled Italian countryside and perhaps youâ re not wedded to Tuscany as the destination If thatâ s the case then perhaps you should consider a day tour to the borderlands between Umbria and Lazio Romeâ s wider region The area has many of the same lovely features â rolling hills ancient hilltop towns and miles and miles of vineyards Itâ s also much closer to Rome and within an easy hour drive Here youâ ll find gorgeous Renaissance Orvieto medieval Todi and Viterbo stunning Civita Bagnoregio perched on its volcanic outcrop and even the sunny shores of Lake Bolsena Happy planning Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Italy Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get
