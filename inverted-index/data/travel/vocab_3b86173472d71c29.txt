How to plan the ultimate Central American trip TRAVEL How to plan the ultimate Central American adventure Compact it may be but Central America packs a punch These countries beguile with natural wonders ancient ruins and indigenous cultures Granada is known for its colourful to century Hispanic neoclassical and baroque architecture Photograph by Mlenny By Claire Boobbyer November Central America stretches precariously thin Looking at it on a map the isthmus linking Mexico to Colombia tapers progressively as it reaches southward At its end it covers around miles in width a strip of land so narrow it seemingly leaves South America hanging on for dear life But this compact region is rich in natural treasures so much so that it attracted the eye of the Spaniards who arrived in the century in search of gold and silver The region eventually split into the seven countries known as Central America today Belize Guatemala El Salvador Honduras Nicaragua Costa Rica and Panama The Spaniards legacy is evident from the language to the architecture with striking cities like Antigua Guatemala a collection of one storey homes in shades of coffee and pistachio and neoclassical and baroque churches The conquistadors were hardly the first to set foot here In the pre Columbian era some Indigenous communities inhabited the region alongside the Maya a civilisation that flourished between BCE and AD from modern day southern Mexico to Honduras At their height the region s city states were populated by millions and had ceremonial centres colossal pyramids and astronomy complexes Their warrior kings dressed in jade and feathers planned battles by reading the stars They carved their deeds in stone sculpting elaborate glyphs Tikal is famous for its pyramid tombs poking high above the jungle canopy Photograph by Macrophotos Getty Images Today travellers can visit the ruins of these ancient civilisations amid Central America s jungle most famously those of Chichén Itzá in the Yucatán and Tikal in Guatemala Those descended from the Maya living predominantly in the Yucatán Guatemala and Belize preserve ancient crafts cuisine and a deeply rooted spirituality This heritage

the ground adventurers can explore a ruin visit a colonial era city browse an indigenous crafts market climb a volcano take a coffee plantation tour ride a wave spot wildlife from monkeys to jaguars
