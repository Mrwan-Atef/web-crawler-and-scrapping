The best ski areas in Austria this season TRAVEL Where to ski in Austria this season Austria s mix of beginner slopes black runs and mountainside culture works for all from fun seeking families to hardcore off pisters From expertly maintained beginners pistes to some of the highest slopes in the Alps Austria offers a wide range of ski resorts for travellers Photograph by Pawel Kazmierczak Alamy Stock Photo By Mike MacEacheran November This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Traditionally Europe s best all rounder Austria looks set to give France a run for its money this season as the favourite destination certainly among British skiers There s the diversity of resorts from some of the highest in the Alps to expertly maintained beginners slopes set in historic mountain villages plus ever easier access The increase of cheap flight connections to the likes of Innsbruck Salzburg Linz and Klagenfurt means those with summit gleams in their eyes can easily experience a winter lifestyle where serious powder highs and oompah pop fuelled apres ski is the norm Just as well that Austrian ski resorts are so flush with new goings on that it makes sense to return every year And this season is no exception with a host of new ultra modern lifts namely in Schladming Dachstein Zillertal Arena and SkiWelt Wilder Kaiser In Brixental the solar powered Eibergbahn will be the world s most powerful detachable chairlift we ll spare you the technical details Just think swift and sustainable As well as transporting skiers to new places these resorts are in the business of making you feel happier to be alive than when you first arrived One of the tricks is the annual roster of events and spirit of celebratory raucousness In February the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships is taking over Saalbach while during the anniversary of Sölden s Electric Mountain Festival there ll be enough Red Bull and Champagne sprayed to turn the mountains gold And Bryan Adams Sting and Simply Red will help orchestrate the season opener in Schladming Too often skiers stick to what they know but even Austria feels the urge to push us in other directions In Ötztal ice diving workshops in Lake Piburg and crevasse abseils in Obergurgl now marry extreme action with the more populist desire of chasing fresh snow Happily there s plenty of downtime on offer at the vast spa leisure centre Erlebnistherme Zillertal re opening in Fügen after a major facelift And then there s Austria s reliably beautiful ski landscape where skyscraping peaks back chocolate box hamlets of gingerbread cabins and oodles of old fashioned Alpine charm Whether you re skiing partying or enjoying one of Austria s many mountain festivals a visit to these Eastern Alps this winter may be the best version of a ski trip you ve ever had Here s where to hit the slopes in Austria this season Zell am See Kaprun Best for families Every ski resort would benefit from its own mascot The Narnia like Schmittenhohe peak in Zell has its own dragon Schmidolin a red quiffed creature who s often spotted on skis Add floodlit tobogganing until and the reliable glacier at Kitzsteinhorn for spring skiing and family fun is guaranteed Montafon Best for book worms Before the days of his travels in Florida East Africa and Cuba Ernest Hemingway spent two seasons ski touring in Vorarlberg with its powder stirring him to write The Snows of Kilimanjaro These days it s equally motivating if less hard work with cable cars and lifts connecting miles of ski routes and prize winning pistes Austria s ski resorts are surrounded by marvellous winter landscapes Photograph by Dirk Rueter Alamy Stock Photo SkiWelt Wilder Kaiser Brixental Best for all abilities Panoramic summit viewing platforms are popping up everywhere in the Alps and the latest in Tyrol is at the top station of the Zinsberg cable car in Brixen Following the vista you can further blow your mind playing snakes and ladders across miles of piste including Austria s largest night skiing area St Anton Best for off piste adventure The popularity of Arlberg s star resort is founded on its off piste terrain and legendary apres ski the word that springs to mind is wild surviving nights out at Mooserwirt and Krazy Kanguruh is a badge of honour Rising early is mandatory though as is ripping round the Run of Fame the Alps longest continuous ski circuit Obergurgl Best for beginners While Sölden further down the Ötztal Valley has the James Bond theatrics see the following feature Obergurgl is for novices yet to pull the trigger The terrain mostly blue and red graded runs is covered by heavily discounted lift passes a hallmark of the so called Diamond of the Alps Kids can ski from around a day Bad Kleinkirchheim Best for downhill racers Franz Klammer Austria s most famous racer earned his stripes in Carinthia a region that s opening up with new flights between London and Klagenfurt For the first season SkiWeekends Flexiski and Ski Club Freshtracks now offer package trips here and so far few British accents echo along its tree lined pistes Lech Best for luxury Lech is the sort of place where you won t get much change from for a few nights ski and sleep The ultra luxe pads by Arula Chalets and Pepper Collection are among the Alps swankiest with cinemas concierges and chefs But there are more sensibly priced stays too so thrilling runs like the legendary White Ring connecting to Zürs can be enjoyed by all Bad Gastein Best for culture Bad Gastein s currency is high culture from classical concerts to the largest art festival in the Alps February when the slopes are carpeted in ice sculpture Snow Jazz March brings a degree of melody to the mountains rarely seen elsewhere Between piano solos run your
