National Geographic Traveller UK Whether you re longing to fill your lungs with sea air or are looking to spend some quiet days rambling through the countryside these UK destinations are all perfectly suited to spring travel From the Queen of Welsh resorts to the region that s home to the UK s rarest butterfly species these are of the best destinations to escape to this Easter holiday and beyond North Staffordshire The West Midlands county of Staffordshire was once a powerhouse of innovation taking century Britain into a ground breaking future with its nascent pottery glass iron coal and brewing industries The powerhouse tag may no longer quite ring true but the heritage remains with its canal system just one welcome leftover from the period The overall impression these days is decidedly more rural than industrial The moorlands and dales of the Peak District extend into its northeastern fringes while gentle valleys and hills punctuated by stone built villages define much of the region elsewhere Near the centre of England come for easy activities unique accommodation and a smattering of that industrial heritage Discover North Staffordshire the historic pottery hot spot in the heart of England Wiltshire Wiltshire may well be the most mysterious county in England It s home to the country s densest concentration of Neolithic remains among them the blockbuster that is Stonehenge and a scattering of giant white horses carved into hillsides and visible for miles around Ask what they re for or why they re there and the response is commonly a shrug and a who knows The attractions lose none of their appeal for being enigmatic however This is a largely rural county of chalkland hills where mist clings to valley floors and lingers in woodlands long after the sun has risen myth and fable seem in built into the landscape And when you re done pondering the questions left to us by our ancient predecessors there are inviting pubs to retreat to in pretty villages Nothing dispels a sense of mysticism quicker than a pint of local ale enjoyed by the fireside There s more to this English county than just Stonehenge Avebury Stone Circle was built between BCE and BCE Photograph by SJ Images Alamy St Andrews Scotland In medieval times the bones of St Andrew patron saint of Scotland s Pictish people were brought to a small wind worn town atop a sandstone plateau in Fife on the country s east coast These relics conferred such celebrity that a bishop took up residence a great cathedral was commissioned and the town now known as St Andrews became the country s ecclesiastical capital Today St Andrews ruined roofless cathedral yawns at the heavens and parts of the town s medieval castle have tumbled into the sea You might think this would dent St Andrews appeal quite the opposite These skeletal remains give the town s coastline a spectral beauty that s best appreciated in winter after the golfers that descend each summer have cleared out Another draw is that Fife s spirits industry once feared dead has reawakened with whisky and gin distilleries putting the region back on the map The best place to try them is at a traditional pub or by a hotel fire after a windswept walk between desolate beaches What to see in St Andrews Scotland beyond the golf course Weymouth Strung along a bay in southwest England Weymouth still possesses many of the characteristics that once charmed Georgian and Victorian holidaymakers the children waving from bulb lit carousels the boats slung with nets of rock oysters the fisherfolk unloading the day s catch in a harbour backed by pastel hued houses In many ways it s the quintessential English seaside town only with a clifftop fortress and a World Heritage Site thrown in for good measure Set on the UNESCO listed Jurassic Coast a mile stretch of fossil rich cliffs and beaches straddling Devon and Dorset it serves as an ideal base for those looking to delve into the geology of the surrounding landscape Wind lashed isles are within easy reach while exhilarating boat trips along the coast offer a fresh perspective on Dorset s marine life and otherworldly rock formations Welcome to Weymouth the British seaside resort with a twist Weymouth s harbour is lined by pastel coloured terraced houses Photograph by Milos Ruzicka Alamy North Pennines Range Set between the national parks of the Lake District Yorkshire Dales and Northumberland the green mountains of the North Pennines rise like dragons spines to form a rugged dividing line across the country The region offers some of the finest qualities of its more famous neighbours glorious hillwalking ancient ruins and industrial heritage but is a quieter alternative for those seeking an adventure in the wilds of northern England A region of gushing cascades and gusty slopes it s not hard to see why the area a National Landscape and UNESCO Global Geopark has long stoked the fires of the imagination Folklore tells of red cloaked ghosts that dwell in waterfalls demonic river sprites and spectral horse drawn carriages rattling along country roads But it s in the realm of reality not myth that this region is at its most remarkable Amid the natural beauty of its landscapes humanity has made its mark in spectacular ways with the scars of old quarries and lead mines now havens for wildlife The North Pennines also make a quiet base from which to explore the longest and best preserved stretch of Hadrian s Wall one of the most remarkable Roman monuments just across the border in Northumberland This mountain range should be on every tour of northern England The heather is in bloom within the rugged heather filled North York Moors Photograph by Daniel Rao Getty Images North York Moors Driving into the North York Moors National Park is a bit like delving into the pages of The Secret Garden it was indeed these heather clothed moorlands that inspired Frances Hodgson Burnett s novel Granted this pocket of North Yorkshire might not be such a secret its hiking paths country pubs and historic villages have magnetic appeal and for good reason Throw in the Howardian Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty AONB which sits on the southern edge of the national park and you ve got yourself one of the UK s most idyllic getaways Follow in the footsteps of monks and literary giants on the North York Moors Llandudno A Victorian favourite once billed as the Queen of Welsh resorts Llandudno has kept much of the charm that made it so popular The curving promenade framing Llandudno Bay the aroma of fish and chips wafting in the air pastel coloured art deco houses lining the seafront and old fashioned amusements on Llandudno Pier all combine to deliver a quintessential British seaside break The town also serves as gateway to a wealth of natural attractions in Eryri Snowdonia National Park and water based adventures in Colwyn Bay And a stay in Llandudno can be combined with a trip to Conwy across the river of the same name which has a mighty castle and Britain s smallest house A break in Llandudno a vintage Welsh beachside resort with enduring appeal Bodysgallen Hall in Llandudno is one of only three National Trust
