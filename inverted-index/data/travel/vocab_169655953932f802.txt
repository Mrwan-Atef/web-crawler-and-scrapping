Share Rue des Consuls in Rabat Hemis Alamy Deciding when to travel to Morocco depends on your itinerary because the country has fantastic destinations for visitors year round from dreamy cities to seaside escapes high mountain passes to haunting desert dunes Advertisement The mild months from October to April see an influx of tourists from the northern hemisphere For the rest of the year â especially in July and August along the coast â Morocco is busy with both domestic and international travelers Whether you want to sun yourself on a package holiday to surf or hike to partake of the cuisine or local festivals or to explore the rich culture find the best time for your trip to Morocco with these tips September is the best month for good weather and fewer crowds Domestic and international travelers head back to school and work after the August summer holidays so September is a great time to visit The weather is warm with long sunny days balmy waters and quiet beaches It s also an excellent month to visit the top cultural sights in the coastal cities of Essaouira Rabat Casablanca Tetouan and Tangier Inland Marrakesh and surrounding regions can still be quite hot in September Souss Massa National Park Shutterstock September to November and March to May are best for hiking and visiting Marrakesh For sunny days and temperatures that aren t too hot or cold visit Marrakesh in spring March to May or fall September to November Avoid the summer months of June to August unless you have a love affair with air conditioning and C F heat nights can be cold from December to February especially in riads courtyard homes without central heating Advertisement During May and October you can get around comfortably in Moroccoâ s portion of the Sahara Desert â expect to find most desert camps closed from June to August due to the excessive heat Conversely days are shorter during the winter months from December to February and the nights and early mornings can be freezing particularly when sleeping under canvas Sandstorms occur from January to May but Saharwians are used to these storms follow their lead by wearing a Tuareg scarf to protect your face from the sand and sun The High Atlas Mountains are a year round hiking destination but the weather is mildest from April to June and September to November with ideal conditions for people of all fitness levels In May you ll see the Mâ Goun valley come alive for a festival of roses If you prefer lower altitudes consider a visit to the Anti Atlas range in springtime This season is for wildflowers spring blossoms in the trees and quiet hiking trails An annual almond blossom festival takes place in Tafraoute in February or March depending on when the trees flower and the harvest The mild spring and fall are also the best times to see migratory birds The top birding spot on the coast is Oualidia its peaceful lagoon is a haven for resident and migratory waterbirds Souss Massa National Park also attracts migratory birds which gather here in large numbers before or after their Atlantic crossings Jebel Toubkal Lukas Hodon Shutterstock December to February is the season for celebrations surfing and skiing The weather can be cold and wet from December to February especially in the north but winter is an excellent time for urban exploration In Marrakesh and other hubs popular with foreign residents and visitors you can enjoy epic celebrations over the Christmas and New Year holidays However prices increase significantly during the peak vacation dates from December until January Yennayer the Amazigh New Year falls in the first week of January so there may be some local festivities around at this time as well In deep winter the peaks of the High Atlas are covered in snow should you prefer to ski down rather than hike up mountains The snow can create hazardous conditions for driving on remote roads though and some routes will close But the main skiing areas â Oukaimeden and Ifrane â are accessible and skiing can be a perhaps unexpected and fun addition to a North African adventure The Atlantic swell is most consistent on the Moroccan coast in winter December to February see the largest waves and surfers flock to Taghazout Mirleft Sidi Ifni and other spots along Moroccoâ s west coast A lively center for surf culture Taghazout hosts an annual surf expo in October and international competitions such as the World Surf League in January and February A musician in Agadir GettyImages June to September is the best time for festivals and kitesurfing Moroccoâ s long summer days and nights are ideal for outdoor music events and bands and musicians fill venues nationwide Top festivals to look out for include the Fez Festival of World Sacred Music dates vary from late May to September Essaouiraâ s Gnaoua and World Music Festival and Rabatâ s Mawazine â one of the worldâ s largest festivals â in June and an art festival in Asilah and Casablancaâ s Jazzablanca in July Book accommodations well in advance and be prepared for higher prices During July and August inland temperatures can soar to over C F but on the Atlantic coast cooling breezes and misty fog keep temperatures down to around C F Agadir Dakhla and Essaouira are particularly popular with domestic travelers in August thanks to the lifeguard protected beaches While the Moroccan sun is strong beach parasols and covered outdoor seating areas are easy to find and the ocean is calmer and warmer â perfect for swimming riding pedalos and stand up paddleboarding The mellower waves from June to November are suitable for beginner and intermediate surfers Consistent trade winds from the Atlantic make kitesurfing and windsurfing possible all year at several flat water spots in Essaouira and Dakhla but April to September have reliable high winds because of the thermal effect along the Moroccan coastline An annual kitesurfing competition is held in Dakhla at the end of September drawing competitors and spectators from around the world Experience Morocco without the crowds during Ramadan Check the dates for Ramadan as they vary year to year This sacred period is a quiet and spiritual time to experience Morocco Though many food establishments close during the day you ll still find places to eat at hotels Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a
