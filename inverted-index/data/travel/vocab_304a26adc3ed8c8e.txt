restorations and lots of pizza make now the time to visit this Southern Italian city By Julia Buckley February min read In Naples Italy the past and the present constantly intertwine Yes it s rowdy Yes it s chaotic It s also electric and layered with intrigue Some new discoveries here were last seen in antiquity a cache of Greek tombs deep under the modern city a graffitied Roman era snack bar in nearby Pompeii A vista of Naples includes its skinny downtown streets as well as Vomero Hill a high point that holds a medieval fortress and historic monastery Photograph by Salvatore Laporta Kontrolab LightRocket Getty Images This blend of past and future has always been the beauty of Naples founded as Neapolis new city by Greek settlers in around B C it s a place that is constantly retelling its own story Instead of turning their backs on pizza young Neapolitans are reimagining it galleries slip contemporary works amid Renaissance masterpieces and artists find inspiration for their work from a year history All this gives Naples an energy that few other cities have Here s how to explore the southern Italian metropolis now Old neighborhood new energy Sanità is where that energy is currently pulsating Once one of the poorest areas of Naples today it s one of the most popular But where in other cities gentrification gradually excludes locals Sanità s emergence has been more of a reevaluation of what was already there Zoom in for more detail Not only is Sanità Naples in microcosm Roman archaeological remains elegantly peeling Renaissance palaces motorbikes weaving between it all it s another place where old and new enmesh In the Santa Maria della Sanità church modern art sits alongside ancient in its bowels youngsters of the quartiere neighborhood give tours of the San Gaudioso catacombs frescoed with jaunty century skeletons At the center of the neighborhood s Piazza Sanità there s a contemporary bronze statue of a young man in jeans and a T shirt his left arm draped over his knee as he looks shyly down It s a portrait of Genny Cesarano who was when he was killed by the Camorra mafia in an innocent bystander caught in crossfire as he chatted with friends in the piazza His death rocked the working class neighborhood Everyone flooded into the piazza to protest says artist Paolo La Motta Nobody wanted to forget so the neighbors asked La Motta to make the sculpture to remember him by Yet the figure looks familiar since the artist based its stance on that of a naked bronze of the Roman god Hermes cast nearly years ago for the lavish Villa dei Papiri in Pompeii Only the ancient figure sits alone at the National Archaeological Museum of Naples and the bronze Genny occupies a busy gathering space its neck hung with rosaries placed lovingly by the local community Visitors walk along the Napoli Lungomare seafront promenade which offers bay views and a respite from the hectic city Photograph by Pablo Castagnola Anzenberger Redux Small restaurants line a narrow centuries old stone street in Naples Italy Photograph by Lorenzo Moscia Archivolatino Redux Down the road Alessandra Calise is gearing up to open the year old tombs that lie beneath her chic B B Casa d Anna The Ipogeo dei Cristallini is an extraordinary clutch of four frescoed graves once part of a larger necropolis for Greek Neapolis from the fourth century B C to the first century A D Lost for almost two millennia the tombs were discovered in when an ancestor of Calise s husband was digging for water in his garden Starting in June the family aims to open them to the public via small guided tours Forty feet below ground the most notable tomb has names of the dead scrawled in Greek on the walls sumptuous bed shaped sarcophagi painted in bright scarlets turquoises and yellows and a snake haired gorgon flashing the evil eye It s not just ancient history on display here next door jewelry maker Vincenzo Oste has opened a tiny hotel cum gallery above his workshop and stuffed it full of art by his father the late Neapolitan sculptor Annibale Oste Neapolitans often rely on motorbikes like Vespas to dash around the city s narrow lanes Photograph by Pablo Castagnola Anzenberger Redux Again past and present swirl into each other the rooms at Atelier Inès named after Vincenzo Oste s wife a fellow jeweler are a generational mash up Annibale Oste s lamps and sculptures teamed with Vincenzo and Inés fixtures and fittings The doors are modeled on vases found in those ancient Greek tombs even the toilet brushes were designed downstairs and smelted in Oste s nearby foundry Artists have always brought our history forward he says adding that Naples location beside an active volcano and open to attack from the sea has instilled a need to keep history close to hand Naples is a high risk place we know everything can change from one second to the next he says So we try to drag things from the past into the present before they disappear And because of that uncertainty from Vesuvius we renew renew renew Art through the ages The art scene is where this weaving together of past and present is most obvious The church of Pio Monte della Misericordia in the historic center is known for its Caravaggio altarpiece The Seven Works of Mercy It s an enormous excoriating painting of swooping angels and spotlit people in varying degrees of need but I m struck by the surrounding coral sculptures by contemporary artist Jan Fabre and the soothing Anish Kapoor sculpture in the gallery upstairs Nearby a Banksy has taken up residence by one of the historic center s most traditional pizzerias The Pio Monte della Misericordia church in the center of Naples holds an altarpiece painted by Caravaggio featuring airborne angels and people in need

Caravaggios energizing the Old Masters while the top floor is dedicated to contemporary artists Alongside Andy Warhol and Louise Bourgeois is Sanità s Paolo La Motta whose Renaissance inspired polyptych of Genny Cesarano blazes out its mustard background glowing like the sun That La Motta says is down to the Pompeii inspired ochers he used Because even the city s ancient remains have that

complex underneath Visitors can see the brick arches below marble tubs above and the laundry dangling from the apartment blocks squeezing round it Nearby Naples only Roman theater is currently being

walk the original basalt paved street to the thermopolium a Roman fast food joint revealed in What did Julius Caesar really look like Here archaeologists found remnants of food in amphorae slotted into a buffet counter smelling wine as they excavated The counter is painted La Motta s brassy ocher and frescoed with images of chickens and birds the menu Outside electoral slogans He s a man of

Universal Images Group Getty Images Nearby in the Casa del Giardino which was being renovated at the time of the eruption is an inscription that changes history The stuff must be delivered before November Previously it was thought Pompeii was destroyed in August A D but this scrawled on a wall by builders moved the date back to October There goes Naples again I think rewriting its history years on Traditional pizza with a twist Of course Naples modern equivalents of that thermopolium are the pizzerias At Le Figlie di Iorio Teresa Iorio flings ingredients meatballs corn even cream onto the dough as her sister yells out the orders She specializes in fried pizza she tells me what women made for centuries while the men were twirling dough discs Gino Sorbillo one of around pizzaiuoli pizza makers in Naples stretches dough at his eponymous restaurant The pizza makers are recognized as a part of Italy s heritage by UNESCO Photograph by Gianni Cipriano The New York Times Redux Tradition is important to her We have to remember our roots she says If a pizza becomes gourmet it s not pizza anymore Yet her creation which won her the accolade of world s best fried pizza in Femmena e Fritta or Female and Fried seems anything but traditional ricotta lemon pistachios mortadella and provolone Dig into the twisty delicious history of Neapolitan pasta That s where I m wrong Teresa tells me For starters she grew up eating mortadella because prosciutto was expensive Plus ricotta stuffed rolls were popular when she was a child So in my pizza I associated lots of things that I was brought up with she explains You have to keep innovating but you have to find a way to keep the tradition going at the same time Frenetic inventive and forever sloughing off one skin to reveal
