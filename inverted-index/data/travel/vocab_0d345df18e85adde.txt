Jackie Gutierrez Jones May min read Share Explore the waterfalls swimming pools and shaded hiking trails of the Dominican Republic Â ovbelov Shutterstock Thinking of stepping outside the Dominican Republicâ s bounty of all inclusive resorts Then youâ re in for a number of enriching experiences Hiking through the islandâ s various regions is one of the best ways to immerse yourself in its abundant natural beauty and wide variety of ecosystems Majestic waterfalls cascading into pristine pools of water rocky rivers winding their way through dense vegetation and cool mountain air with panoramic island views â the Dominican landscape is a hikerâ s haven Whether you re leisurely winding your way along the shores of the islandâ s unspoiled beaches or making your way up a mountain to snap pictures off of a cliffside swing the Dominican Republic offers outdoor hiking adventures for novices and experts alike making it a popular activity for visitors looking to get an up close and personal view of the native wildlife and vegetation Note Many of the islandâ s hikes require the assistance of a guide or a reliable GPS system as signage detailed maps and marked trails can be scarce Advertisement Make your way to the shoreline of the Samana Peninsula and you ll find a few trails to enjoy with ocean views Â Benny Marty Shutterstock beaches hike Best trail for non hikers miles round trip hours easy Most visitors come to the Dominican Republic to soak up their fair share of sunshine and beaches and this hike checks all those boxes Starting from Las Galeras youâ ll wind your way through the shoreline of seven different beaches in the Samana Peninsula traversing coconut groves small hills and plenty of sandy coasts on your path This route doesnâ t require a guide or hiking tour and thereâ s a good chance youâ ll be one of only a few people on the trail But as you near Playa Rincon youâ ll have a chance to take part in some company and refuel with a cold drink and some fresh fish from one of the local beach shacks in the area If the roundtrip trek is too long you can cut the hike in half by catching a boat or taxi at Playa Rincon thatâ ll take you back to the beginning of the path Cueva de la Virgen Best family friendly hike miles round trip minutes easy Legend has it that the spirit of La Ciguapa the titular virgin of the site still inhabits the cave in the rocky canyon of Garganta del Diablo Devilâ s Gorge in Barahona and can turn visitors to stone While there are no reports of tourists turning into statues in the area the trail remains a popular hike for adults and children alike Along the path youâ ll make your way through a vegetal rainforest replete with seven species of ferns and fruit trees all of which are labeled with their medicinal properties Youâ ll also have the opportunity to cross gentle streams maneuver small climbs and finally take a cool dip in the Cueva de la Virgen a cavernous expanse surrounded by natural pools and waterfalls Barahona in the southwest region of the Dominican Republic is known for its crystal clear swimming holes Â Marvin del Cid Getty Images Balneario La Plaza Best hike for a swim miles round trip hours moderate Head to Barahona in the southwest region of the Dominican Republic and set your coordinates for Balneario La Plaza a crystal clear swimming hole situated in the mountain region This pleasant day hike will take you through some rocky streams and rivers so make sure your footwear is well equipped to handle the terrain Advertisement Your destination is a small canyon with a crystal clear pool fed by smaller waterfalls and a sliver of sunlight at its peak But to get there youâ ll need a guide to lead the way as many of the paths and coordinates are unmarked Your best bet is to find an official hiking tour or outfit as some visitors have reported being swindled â and in some cases robbed â by individuals offering to take them to the site The best time to visit the Dominican Republic Head up the mountainsides of the Dominican Republic to begin your day of hiking Â B Cruz Shutterstock MontaÃ a Redonda Best hike for mountain views miles round trip minutes moderate About an hourâ s drive from Punta Cana the trail at MontaÃ a Redonda is somewhat steep at about but straightforward Despite the lack of signposts thereâ s only one path leading up making the trail easy to navigate After hiking up the path visitors are treated to degree panoramic views of the Cordillera Oriental part of what makes up the Colombian Andes rain forests and on a clear day the shores and beaches of Samana But one of the most popular activities at MontaÃ a Redonda is taking photos while swinging in the sky high swing sets hammocks and teeter totters that seemingly float off the edge of the cliff but donâ t worry â you wonâ t actually fly off into a cavernous abyss Dunas de Bani Best desert hike miles round trip minutes moderate Itâ s not often you find a Mad Max desert landscape in the middle of a tropical Caribbean island â unless youâ re in the Dominican Republic Located in a national park in Las Calderas Peninsula the Dunas de Bani is just that â a sandy field of dunes composed of quartz and feldspar from the nearby Bahia Stream and Nizao River As you make your way up the highest dune about youâ ll come across wildlife and fauna that are very specific to the region Think mangroves olive and mesquite trees lizards flamingoes and night herons The heat is particularly scorching in this area of the island so packing a hat sunscreen and water is strongly advised Once youâ ve reached the top one of the wildest beaches in the Dominican Republic comes into view â and while swimming in its rough currents isnâ t really an option you might catch a surfer or two trying to tame its waves Top things to do in the Dominican Republic Pico Duarte Best overnight hike miles round trip days moderate While this is one of the lengthier â and steepest â hikes in the Dominican Republic the trails arenâ t necessarily very difficult or technical but do require decent endurance and fitness Expect a long and steady climb with of elevation gain that culminates at Pico Duarte At ft itâ s the highest mountain peak in all of the Caribbean and rewards dedicated hikers with jaw dropping views of the Central Mountain Range You can access the hiking trails at five different entry points the La CiÃ naga trail is the quickest and most popular each offering various levels of difficulty Depending on your chosen route youâ ll run into rivers rocky streams lush pine forests and native wildlife The park requires that you pay an entrance fee and hire a guide to help you navigate the trails so be prepared to have those arrangements settled before you arrive Canon de Arroyo Frio offers over natural swimming pools cascades and waterfalls for hikers Â Don Mammoser Shutterstock Canon de Arroyo Frio Best hike for water enthusiasts miles round trip hours difficult Hiking along the Canon de Arroyo Frio â located in the Cordillera Septentrional Mountain Range near Cabarete â requires trekking experience good physical fitness and a knack for navigating your way through various water attractions Thatâ s because the trail near this clear cerulean river will take you through over natural swimming pools cascades and waterfalls So while the distance and elevation arenâ t really a challenge the terrain â which requires you to swim wade jump and balance your way through rocky river surfaces and water filled canyons â isnâ t for the faint of heart Opting for a hiking tour is your best bet here with most making time for jumping from the occasional waterfall the highest of which reaches You might also like Dominican Republic beyond the beaches Best places to
