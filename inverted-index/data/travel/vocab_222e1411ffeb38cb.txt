treasure in a city defined by its otherworldly Modernista buildings Unesco listed Casa Batlló is undoubtedly one of Antoni Gaudí s great jewels Created between and for the wealthy Batlló family the once private home on glamorous Passeig de Gràcia combines a shimmering tile covered facade bone evoking stone columns a dragon back shaped rooftop and undulating marine world forms with revolutionary advances in both light and architecture This is Gaudí at his whimsical nature inspired peak As you gaze at the building s swirling shapes delicate trencadís smashed up tilework and curving design Gaudí avoided straight lines as nature doesn t have any the whole place feels almost alive For many people the legend of Sant Jordi Saint George the patron saint of Catalonia and the Dragon runs through the entire structure and you ll certainly feel this up on the unmissable rooftop Unlike Gaudí s neighboring also spectacular La Pedrera Casa Milà which was originally conceived as apartments and offices Casa Batlló was a custom designed residential home from the beginning and most of the privately owned building is now open to visitors Insider tip From around March to autumn Casa Batlló offers live music performances up on the roof terrace flamenco jazz rock and more These tickets also include an after hours tour of the building along with a sunset drink on the rooftop before the show starts Casa Amatller next to the facade of Casa Batlló makes for quite the Modernista spectacle Tom Lau Getty Images History of Casa Batlló This building originally went up in under the watch of architect Emili Sala i Cortés during the major construction boom along Passeig de Gràcia as Barcelona s brand new Eixample district was brought to life from scratch But when it was taken over by the local textiles magnate Josep Batlló i Casanovas in he brought in Gaudí to renovate the entire property with complete creative freedom Casa Batlló is flanked on one side by the Casa Amatller designed by Modernista architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch while the Casa Lleó Morera courtesy of Lluís Domènech i Montaner sits a few doors down Jointly known as the Mansana de la Discòrdia Block of Discord these three fantastical buildings are a testament both to the many whims of Catalonia s Modernisme movement and the enormous local wealth poured into their creation Highlights of Casa Batlló The facade There s no missing Casa Batlló s fantastical facade overlooking Passeig de Gràcia just a few blocks northwest of Plaça de Catalunya With its slender stone window columns and wavy mask shaped balconies it s easy to see why the building has been locally known as the casa dels ossos house of bones for years A wildly beautiful canvas of blue green and purple trencadís tilework ripples across the exterior many experts liken it to the French Impressionist Claude Monet s famous Water Lilies Each April during Barcelona s Sant Jordi festivities the balconies are decorated with swirls of red roses Step inside Climbing the spiral wood banister staircase to the main early century salon on the floor is like wandering into a monumental work of art Wave like wooden windows adorned with mollusk shaped stained glass stretch across the length of the room which gazes out onto Passeig de Gràcia and the ceiling swirls like the sea around a splendid chandelier Continuing on Gaudí s clever use of natural light means the ocean blue lightwell feels almost like a moving wave At the back of the building tile covered plant pots and more than pieces of trencadís adorn the back terrace which was designed as a hidden retreat in the thick of the city Up on the roof In the lofty attic you ll walk through signature Gaudí hyperboloid arches which together resemble an animal s ribcage But Casa Batlló s showstopper is the surreal meandering roof terrace where colorfully tiled chimneys another Gaudí specialty spiral towards the sky and Barcelona sprawls out all around you The sparkling roof has the shape of a dragon s back its scale like tiles even change color depending on where it s glimpsed from and the four armed cross is said to represent Sant Jordi s sword The incredible beauty of Casa Battló continues throughout the building imagIN gr photography Shutterstock A feast for all the senses A prize winning renovation has brought in an all new cutting edge immersive experience at
