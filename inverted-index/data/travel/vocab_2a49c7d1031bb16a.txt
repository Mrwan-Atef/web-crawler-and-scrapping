This is a place that encourages visitors to be friendly and neighborly Pubs are the heart of the social life in the city You don t go there to watch TV You don t go there to stay on your phone You go there to converse with other people and socialize Jonathan Irish National Geographic Photographer Jonathan recommends the specialty at Grogan s a ham and Irish cheddar cheese toastie with a pot of Irish tea You can ask the bartender to make it special with sliced onions and tomatoes or dot it with Colmans yellow mustard for added zing For a memorable fish and chips plate head a bit west to The Brazen Head pub There s been an establishment serving guests on these grounds since and the medieval fortress like building has been licensed to serve ale since The stone wall and red leather seat

Ireland s most popular tourist attractions The site is worth a visit book tickets in advance even if you aren t a fan of iconic dark stout Dublin s Coolest Neighborhood With its Victorian terraced cottages and brightly colored doors Stoneybatter has been called one of the coolest neighborhoods in the world It s a really interesting contrast between traditional UK architecture and these really beautiful colored doors and window dressings I get really excited when I find interesting things like that Jonathan Irish National Geographic Photographer Stoneybatter began as one of the city s earliest villages and by the late century had become so filled with wandering animals in its streets that it earned the nickname Cowtown To this day boot scrapers can be found outside some of its doors People needed something and somewhere to wipe the mud from their shoes before entering The neighborhood remains one of the best preserved parts of the city where visitors mesh easily with students young professionals and creatives One of the best spots to observe local life is at Slice a neighborhood caf√© and restaurant thats been serving up some of Dublin s best brunch fare for the past decade try their slow cooked BBQ beef banh mi smashed avocado toast or fluffy buttermilk pancakes LEFT The charming neighborhood of Stoneybatter is a perfect mix of the old and the new While each cottage may look like the next the pops of color featured on the front doors give them their own unique look and personality RIGHT Delicious food pastries and coffee along with a warm friendly staff make Slice a must stop spot in Stoneybatter Earn AAdvantage miles at restaurants with the Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select Card Jonathan also suggests perusing the shelves at The Lilliput Press The famous publishing house was trusted with the first ever Dublin based printing of the classic novel Ulysses in It found its home in Stoneybatter when it moved to the neighborhood in quickly becoming one of the city s most charming bookstores Urban Green Spaces One of Europe s largest city parks is Phoenix Park known as the place where Dublin goes to breathe The park was once a royal hunting reserve Today all manner of wildlife including a herd of wild fallow deer and an impressive array of birds roam free It s the antidote for the hustle and bustle of city life You really feel like you re away from it all Jonathan says Rent a bike from Phoenix Park Bikes to better explore the acre park s paths Victorian Tea Rooms woodlands monuments and historic buildings Save time to park your bike sit on a bench and soak in the gorgeous surroundings Jonathan found a similar zen vibe on early morning photo walks along the River Liffey s picturesque bridges and recommends renting a kayak or booking a boat tour for a new perspective LEFT In James Butler Duke of Ormond originally established Phoenix Park as Royal Deer Park and imported fallow deer from Great Britain Today the park is home to around deer including many descendants of the original herd that arrived more than years ago RIGHT Make time to walk along the River Liffey take in the vibrance and character of the Irish capital In the heart of Dublin you ll find St Stephen s Green The enclosed acre park which sits just across from the famous Shelbourne Hotel the first Irish Constitution was drafted in a room here in retains its Victorian garden oasis feel Wander tree lined paths past languishing swans and ornamental gardens One of Dublin s most popular parks St Stephen s Green provides locals and visitors alike with a calming escape from the bustling city center Beyond the gates of St Stephen s Green is Grafton Street where shop windows are filled with fashion forward deals and Dublin souvenirs Grab a tasty treat an ice cream cone with a stick of flaky milk chocolate inserted at the top then take in the slew of talented buskers musicians who turn the streets into impromptu performance venues Irish Craftsmanship For souvenirs Jonathan suggests something iconically Irish I bought a Merino wool blanket and a flat cap at the Aran Sweater Market he says noting that the experience helped him better appreciate the intricate subtlety of an Irish stitch Every family has their own stitch and not only in sweaters but blankets and everything In the Aran Market there is a wall with all of the different stitches with the names of the clans they are from It was so fascinating he says The simplest decision to loop the wool a certain way to overlap a stitch or interweave it says so much about the family that made it Jonathan Irish National Geographic Photographer Visitors will be tempted by the famous cable knit sweaters or jumpers as they re known here that originated in the Aran Islands off Ireland s west coast Clerks can offer insights into the handicraft art that has lasted for generations If you ve got Irish roots make your purchase more meaningful by adding a family crest or choosing stitches from the official register of historic patterns In the heart of Dublin s Grafton Quarter sits the Aran Sweater Market home of Irish Aran sweaters and knitwear The market s friendly knowledgeable staff will help you find the perfect accessory or garment that you ll cherish for years to come And So Much More Dive deeper into Dublin s history by visiting the many castles that sit within the city limits At the century Dublin Castle you can tour a Viking settlement as well as the State Apartments that serve as the venue for presidential inaugurations The castle s Dubh Linn Garden and Christ Church Cathedral less than a five minute walk away are two other worthwhile stops and don t miss Marsh s Library Ireland s oldest public library where you can take a peek at books dating back to the century Just outside Dublin Castle you ll find the lush colorful gardens of Dubh Linn Gardens as well as the Coach House which blocked the century castle residents view of nearby
