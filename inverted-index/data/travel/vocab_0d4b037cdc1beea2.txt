See Kenya s wildlife in a different light on horseback TRAVEL BEST OF THE WORLD See Kenya s wildlife in a different light on horseback Riders can encounter leopards rhinos or zebras on these intimate safaris in Kenya s Borana Conservancy Guide Hamprey Mweterwa center on white horse leads a group on a safari in Kenya s Borana Conservancy Visitors to Borana might encounter zebras leopards impalas elephants and the area s population of nearly rhinos relatives of the horse Photograph by Nichole Sobecki National Geographic Story and photographs by Nichole Sobecki February The equatorial sun is relentless bearing down as I lead Elaine a walnut bay with a dark mane through thorny acacia and dense shrub It s been a long day in the saddle My thighs ache and our camp beckons across a ridge of ancient folding hills in the Lolldaiga Range of northern Kenya a mosaic of intertwined landscapes and communities Suddenly Elaine s ears flick into alert antenna like and the muscles of her body tense beneath me Our guide Nicholus Nangunye Tuta stretches out a lean arm toward a bush just meters away My eyes focus straining to see what the others already have two amber orbs glowing from a shadowed form It s a young lion quick and strong crouched amid the high grass A wild silence hangs between us Without the defensive armor and high wheels of a safari vehicle I feel completely exposed Peering into the bush I m suspended between wonder and terror the distance between myself and the savannah s most notorious predator laughably small Usually I m the one tracking the lion camera in hand Now the lion shifts in my consciousness from object to subject I shift too acutely aware of the soft flesh of my own body Guide Hamprey Mweterwa and riders Llewellyn Dyer and Tatiana Rose Dyer gallop over a hill in Kenya s Borana Conservancy A mother giraffe and her calf search for food in Borana Conservancy Kenya The total population of wild giraffes is up significantly since A dominant male lion rests at dusk This big cat has recently faced competition from other males nearby Nicholus nods his head in the other direction a safer distance away He points to indentations in the dust Look this is a big lion and these are young ones some cubs he says Probably a mother Pawprints mottle the earth each telling the story of more lions moving in different directions It was time to go Horseback riding in Kenya is one of best travel experiences for See the full list here In the country where they started in the horseback safaris are still the most immersive way to view wildlife in Kenya To journey on horseback is to break down the walls meant to protect but also to separate us from the natural world And as we re absorbed in the thrill of the experience we re vividly reminded of the importance of protecting these wild spaces Out here your horse is your translator responding to the low hiss of a leopard the soft scent of an elephant herd the cool morning breeze descending from Mount Kenya s glacial peaks Your job is to learn how to listen Safari tourism and conservation Saddling up the next morning we fall into a nose to tail line murmurs of conversation fading as we enter the light dappled mountain forest African olive trees stretch out between sentinel like cedar and wild orchids root amid the branches It looks like challenging terrain to navigate but this trail was blazed by grazing elephants and meanders through the trees with the crooked effortless sweep of a river The wilderness surrounding Lolldaiga Hills serves as a functioning cattle ranch and a center for research and development Photograph by Nichole Sobecki National Geographic Around a corner the rough hewn outline of Mount Kenya appears Three million years ago this singular volcano was birthed from the Earth s core rising to feet before time wore it down Known first as Kirinyaga by the Kikuyu who lived at its feet and considered it sacred Mount Kenya is the highest mountain in the country that became its namesake Ice still sparkles off its basalt peaks even though as our planet has warmed over the last years its once mighty glacier has shrunk by percent The lush volcanic greenery of the country s center fades here to a more austere beauty of sparse woods arid plains and isolated mountains Crops yield to cows This is the future of safaris in Africa Like many conservancies in Kenya Borana began as a cattle ranch though its land was used to sustain livestock long before that For thousands of years cows were the center of culture and currency for the Maasai Samburu Pokot and other pastoral groups When national parks and conservancies began to be established in the middle of the century these same groups routinely found themselves barred from grazing their animals on land they had relied on for generations Borana now aims for deeper engagement with its neighbors with outreach programs such as Mazingira Yetu or our environment in Kiswahili that promote environmental stewardship Students from nearby communities can spend a day at the conservancy go on game drives meet Borana s rangers and learn more about sustainable land practices including water storage regenerative farming and tree nurseries The program launched in bringing students to Borana but has grown to welcome more than students in Here are five game drive alternatives from cycling to camping Borana reinvests all profits into conservation efforts like this one and it s made a difference Last year tourism generated over million leading to the protection of endangered species the training of rangers scholarships for students and drought relief to seven communities But there s a necessary and growing recognition that change doesn t happen in isolation and that long term efforts to protect wildlife require a shared vision across borders communities and interests A mother northern white rhinoceros and her calf graze at dusk in the Borana Conservancy one of Kenya s newest and most successful rhino sanctuaries Students from Sang a Primary School visit nearby Borana Conservancy to learn about the importance of natural ecosystems as part of a conservancy community program On safari they spot elephant Cape buffalo gazelle and zebra then back at the center they explore how soil hydrology grasslands and forests contribute to sustaining life A foal and a stable hand relax as the sun sets over the Conservancy stables Borana houses dozens of horses available for rides through the plains The concept of the horseback safari originated in Kenya back in the and has since expanded to a number of conservancies across the African continent An encounter with rhinos On my final day in Borana Elaine and I crest a hill and I notice her aloof walnut hued eyes clock two grey masses moving just ahead It s a rhino calf and its mother who moves languidly forward to place herself between us and her young Elaine pauses the two locked in a mutual gaze Evolution is a funny thing These two animals are each other s closest living relatives The distant cousins seem to come to a cautious truce We maintain our distance the rhinos continue grazing I relax in the saddle and find my attention shifting from the obvious differences between these creatures to the subtle hints of shared lineage their soulful eyes strong jaws and loping gait Riders stop to watch elephants during a safari from Borana Conservancy through the Lolldaiga Hills The diversity of our natural world is a wonder and there is so much to learn from its infinite contrasts and unexpected connections As the sun falls behind the hill I nudge Elaine She turns away from the now thoroughly unbothered rhinos and we head back home What to Know Get there Both Safarilink and AirKenya offer flights from Nairobi s
