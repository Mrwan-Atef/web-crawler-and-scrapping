Baker Jul min read Share Find homemade cookies and cakes including vegan and gluten free offerings at KarlÃ nâ s Etapa Mark Baker for Lonely Planet Iâ ve been living in Prague for the better part of three decades Over that time Iâ ve witnessed breathtaking changes in the cityâ s food scene It used to be that eating out in Prague meant stodgy plates of pork or beef and stale bread dumplings all swimming in an indecipherable brown sauce Thankfully a new generation of chefs is working to refine the best of our traditional recipes while adding in fresher ingredients and foreign influences Advertisement That said itâ s always a good idea to avoid restaurants that are on or around Old Town Square Many of these with some notable exceptions serve overpriced mediocre food aimed at unsuspecting tourists Instead venture out of the center to the more inventive places Iâ ve named below and enjoy your meal seated alongside locals who are just as pleasantly surprised by the results as you will be Left Eska s signature dish Breakfast Dining out for breakfast is still a relative novelty in Prague Czechs typically start their day at home with a simple bread roll and a cup of coffee MyÅ Ã k a historic early century sweetshop offers a traditional breakfast menu including Viennese style â poached eggs in a glassâ plus a mouthwatering assortment of Czech pastries Donâ t miss their buchty sweet rolls served in custard sauce Å Bistro in Dejvice also features fresh baked bread pastries and a creative breakfast menu of egg dishes apricot dumplings with curd cheese and a satisfying bowl of fruit topped granola and yogurt Nearby MÃ sto boasts arguably Pragueâ s best stuffed omelet plus oven warm bread and home roasted beans for coffee based drinks For hipsters KarlÃ nâ s industrial style bakery Eska puts a local spin on things The menu is built around traditional Czech breakfast entrees like locally sourced ham and soft boiled eggs Left Mark in front of Dos Mundos CafÃ Right The pastry shelf at Dos Mundos in HoleÅ ovice is filled with fresh baked goodies Mark Baker for Lonely Planet Coffee The worldwide coffee revolution is in full swing in Prague every week it brings to the city a new espresso shop or coffee roaster Find many of the best of these in the outlying neighborhoods of KarlÃ n and LetnÃ CafÃ Letka in LetnÃ is a gorgeous space with tastefully distressed walls that are drenched in natural lighting Nearby Dos Mundos CafÃ roasts its own beans sustainably sourced from Colombia and Guatemala and serves a tantalizing array of cakes and pastries In KarlÃ n the always hopping MÅ j Å Ã lek KÃ vy is run by a local specialty roaster Doubleshot The cooks are as talented as the baristas This is a great choice for breakfast or lunch too Advertisement Left Mark is going low carb at Mr HotDog with a Lunch Czechs typically eat their main meal at midday and many restaurants offer discounted daily lunch specials One of these Hostinec na an upscale pub specializes in roast duck a must try local treat when in Prague Foodie destination ep in Vinohrady offers modern takes on classic Czech dishes like pork schnitzel or stuffed potato dumplings at friendlier lunchtime prices Book both places in advance For something quick and easy try the ever popular KRO Kitchen in Vinohrady for locally sourced rotisserie cooked chicken Mr HotDog in the neighborhood of LetnÃ serves up mouthwatering sliders and hot dogs in a relaxed welcoming setting Follow your nose to the industrial styled bakery Eska in KarlÃ n Mark Baker for Lonely Planet Brunch Weekend brunches are a recent addition to the culinary scene but one that residents have embraced with gusto If youâ re looking for international brunch mainstays like eggs Benedict smoked salmon and bottomless pitchers of mimosas the high end hotel affairs like The Monkey Barâ s â Jungle Brunch â have you covered One step down on the posh scale but still excellent is HoleÅ oviceâ s funky Mama Shelter hotel which offers all you can eat Sunday brunch on the terrace from noon to pm Etapa in KarlÃ n is a relaxed neighborhood coffee shop that offers a daily all vegetarian brunch with ingredients sourced from all around Czechia Left The pretty setting for U ModrÃ KachniÄ ky on a quiet picturesque corner in MalÃ Strana Mark Baker for Lonely Planet Right KuchyÅ â s signature steak tartare is served with a side of toasted bread KuchyÅ Dinner When done well traditional Czech cooking can be delicious You canâ t go wrong at either KuchyÅ near Prague Castle or U ModrÃ kachniÄ ky The Blue Duckling in the neighborhood of MalÃ Strana KuchyÅ â s take is more modern and minimalist but the pork neck schnitzel or the beef shank with bread dumplings elevate grandmaâ s cooking to high art U ModrÃ kachniÄ ky is furnished like an extravagant hunting lodge complete with candlelight and white linens The menu is strong on game dishes featuring venison rabbit pheasant and duck U Kroka is more of a classic mom and pop pub with excellent versions of Czech standards like schnitzel goulash and the Czech classic svÃ Ä kovÃ braised beef served in a cream sauce of root vegetables I donâ t often eat at Michelin starred Field the price of the six or course tasting menus are firmly in the â splurgeâ category for me but when I do the meal is always memorable If money is no object Fieldâ s head chef Radek KaÅ pÃ rek presents a highly refined fusion take on classic Czech mains like veal trout or rabbit and prepares these with a special emphasis on fresh and local Youâ ll need to book this one well in advance Left Beer menu above the taps at Dva kohouti Right one of the drinking rooms at U FlekÅ Mark Baker for Lonely Planet Pubs and bars Prague at heart is a beer town Any self respecting Czech pub will pour an excellent Pilsner Urquell brewed in the nearby city of PlzeÅ Pilsen the countryâ s standard bearer when it comes to excellent lager Try LokÃ l on DlouhÃ Street near Old Town Square to see what all the fuss is about U FlekÅ a classic old school pub is admittedly touristy but home brews the cityâ s best dark beer The craft brew scene is booming too I love the California American Pale Ale APA at Dva Kohouti in KarlÃ n Plus they have a big yard for open air drinking Automat MatuÅ ka near the HradÄ anskÃ metro station features a local craft brewer MatuÅ kaâ s excellent range of IPAs and APAs plus an onsite smoker that turns out plates of tender beef brisket and pulled pork To sample some underrated Czech wines from the countryâ s main wine growing region of Moravia look for Bokovka an upscale wine bar hidden in a deceptively shabby courtyard near Old Town Square For high end cocktails Hemingway Bar reservations recommended feels straight out of a Hollywood film noir CafÃ Bar PilotÅ in the happening hood of VrÅ ovice features more playful inventive cocktail concoctions like â VietnamskÃ VeÄ erka â crafted from whatever you might find at the local convenience shop Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address Subscribe now Subscribe to Lonely Planet
