Lemmin Woolfrey Aug min read Share Get the most out of your trip to Qatar with these tips from an expat who lives there Â Sven Hansche Shutterstock Iâ m a year into my second stretch of calling Doha home So Iâ ve learned a thing or two about living in the desert state of Qatar When I first lived here years ago nobody had even heard of this remarkable little country Today cruise ships hug the shoreline and visitors flock here from around the globe Yet some travelers arrive unprepared Advertisement Knowing some background information before your visit will help you make the most of your trip to this country on the Arabian Peninsula From coping with the heat and taking the super modern metro to seeing amazing art and getting to know the Qataris here are my top tips that will help you get the most out of your visit to Qatar Timing your visit to Qatar is crucial Qatarâ s â seasonâ runs from October to May These months are the best time to visit when most events and exhibitions take place and when the temperatures are pleasant enough to walk around outside Qatar is a desert country and it gets hot Like really hot Summer temperatures easily reach â in the shade While you can expect everything from your rental car to the malls and even some bus stops to be air conditioned you might still get uncomfortable bouncing between them Decide to travel â or not â during Ramadan The ninth month of the lunar Islamic calendar the holy month of Ramadan is when Muslims fast between sunrise and sunset During Ramadan it is frowned upon to eat drink smoke or even chew gum in public during daylight hours While Qataris are tolerant of non Muslim visitors almost all restaurants are closed during the day hotels offer the few exceptions Visiting Qatar during Ramadan means your travel plans have to be more flexible but youâ ll get the chance to experience festivities such as the daily sunset cannon being set off the pretty lantern decorations around town and the nightly iftar the breaking of the fast after sunset thatâ s a joyous event in private homes and restaurants Itâ s respectful to dress modestly when touring Qatar Â Getty Images Take care to dress appropriately Qatar is a Muslim country and while Qataris are tolerant â especially of visitors â itâ s a sign of respect to dress modestly Itâ s not a problem to wear a bikini at hotel beaches and pools but itâ s respectful for men and women to cover their shoulders and wear clothes that reach to the knee when walking around elsewhere especially in areas where you will encounter many locals such as in Souq Waqif Hop on the Doha Metro While much of Dohaâ s center around Souq Waqif and Msheireb is walkable in the cooler months the easiest and most comfortable way to get around is on the Doha Metro This modern clean and expansive system takes you to all the busy hubs within Doha and its surroundings including the airport and the towns of Al Wakrah and Lusail Advertisement Learning about Arab etiquette â including the many traditions associated with coffee â will add to the enjoyment of your Qatar trip Â Juan Alberto Casado Getty Images Understand the local etiquette From avoiding eating with your left hand to coffee taken with cardamom and the various styles of traditional dress Arab culture can be a new experience for those from outside the Muslim world To learn about etiquette and practices directly from Qataris visit Embrace Doha for experiences that will teach you about the cultural ins and outs here Donâ t let preconceptions scare you away Even before they visit many travelers have an opinion about Qatar â but itâ s essential to arrive with an open mind and experience it for yourself While rules customs and laws might differ from where you live Qatar has been changing a lot in recent years When I returned to live in Qatar again after a year absence I barely recognized the place A rise in international visitors has spurred the country to continue to work toward more changes One of the safest countries in the world Qatar provides a great experience for solo women travelers Â urbazon Getty Images Solo female traveler visiting Qatar No worries Many consider Qatar the safest country in the world â and as a woman living here I have never felt threatened Of course it takes only one bad experience to change your view on that but the same holds for every country in the world In Qatar I usually forget to lock my front door and my car and even leave my handbag in my shopping cart You should use common sense as you would anywhere â and expect to feel safe and welcome Try the favorite local breakfast Since Qatar is one of the worldâ s richest countries celebrity chef restaurants abound throughout the capital Yet travelers visiting Qatar on a budget can still find delicious low cost meals such as the local favorite breakfast of karak and chapati A tea made with condensed milk cardamon ginger saffron and sugar karak is spicy as well as sweet while chapati is a flatbread served usually with honey or cheese or both You can try these two staples in most simple looking cafeterias at food stalls in parks or in Katara village Youâ ll know where to find them by the hungry locals queuing up to order Magnificent falcons are treasured in Qatar as a key part of the countryâ s culture Â Abdelrahman M Hassanein Getty Images Learn more about the importance of the beloved national bird The falcon is Qatarâ s national bird and they are so revered that they are allowed on flights and even get their own seat Doha has a falcon hospital as well as a falcon market on your visit stop at Souq Waqif to have a closer look at these gorgeous birds While youâ re there donâ t miss the camels and thoroughbred Arabian horses that are stabled right in the city center Qatar is an art hub of the Middle East Qatar is more than luxury shopping and such prestigious sports events as the FIFA World Cup itâ s quickly becoming a heavyweight on the Middle Eastern art scene too In Hamad International Airport alone you can see more than a dozen installations by such internationally famous artists as KAWS Urs Fischer and Jean Michel Othoneil Head into the desert at Zekreet to see the stunning Eastâ West Westâ East by Richard Serra or visit the enormous Miraculous Journey by Damien Hirst Dohaâ s Museum of Islamic Art is world class while pockets of street art complement the capitalâ s high culture offerings Relax in a park Most of Qatarâ s landscapes are beige and sandy â so take a break from the desert hues at a green park in Doha My favorite is MIA Park behind the Museum of Islamic Art which bends around a bay and is full of small food trucks that sell karak chapati and other goodies MIA Park not only has fabulous mature trees and grass perfect for picnicking but also offers superb views across the skyline with picturesque wooden dhows traditional boats moored nearby Desert excursions provide the ultimate way to encounter Qatari landscapes and culture Â BlueOrange Studio Shutterstock Donâ t miss out on the desert It is easy to keep busy in Doha yet you canâ t leave Qatar without experiencing the desert As you off road over sand dunes in a vehicle to watch flamingos camp under the clear skies of the â inland seaâ of Khor Al Adaid and slide down the horseshoe shaped Singing Dunes youâ ll discover how the desert lies at the literal heart of Qatar â and the figurative one of its people Search out Qatarâ s history Bedouin have long lived around the Arabian deserts but the cultureâ s nomadic lifestyle means that most places in this region donâ t have any ancient structures Yet Qatar has few historic surprises such as the petroglyphs at Al Jassasiya and the Unesco listed Al Zubarah Fort both well worth a visit Plan where to have a drink Itâ s possible to stave off the heat with a cool beer in Qatar â but youâ ll need to plan ahead You cannot import alcohol into Qatar from duty free shops or buy anything but non alcoholic beer from the grocery store nor are you allowed to drink alcohol in public places Alcohol is available in Qatar only on licensed premises such as larger hotels and hotel restaurants Most hotels have superb bars comfortable beer gardens or outdoor restaurants where you can sit back with a glass or two Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us
