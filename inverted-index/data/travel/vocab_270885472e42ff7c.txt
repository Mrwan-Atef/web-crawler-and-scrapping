Turkey in embarking on a fresh discovery of his country and its cuisine before launching his own establishment Turk I had to find my own way of expressing myself and my home country s food Tutak says Related these are the best restaurants in Istanbul The chef s earliest influence was his mother s cooking which inspired him to attend culinary college in the town of Mengen before honing his skills via apprenticeships at hotels and restaurants across Turkey Over the following years Tutak worked his way around the kitchens of renowned restaurants including three Michelin starred Nihonryori RyuGin in Tokyo and Noma in Copenhagen as well as other establishments in Beijing Singapore and Hong Kong In he moved to Bangkok to open The Dining Room of The House on Sathorn It was here for a private client that he first created his now signature dish From My Mom a reinterpretation of traditional Turkish manti dumplings The response of the client who was also from Turkey sparked a realisation of how important it was for Tutak to further explore his homeland s food I finally realised that I needed to stay true to my own roots while also drawing on my experience from restaurants across the world to create new flavour profiles he says To deepen his knowledge of Turkey s local ingredients and regional cuisines Tutak travelled across more than miles of the country To create something meaningful something from the heart I had to go back where I come from because that s me and that s why Turk has been successful he explains I had to travel and learn even more about my roots the food culture and history The Baklava style lamb at Turk featuring sliced rump and fat is layered with mushrooms and onions Photograph by Duygu Turkmen Turkish gastronomy has been shaped by influences from the Ottoman and Seljak empires as well as from the Mediterranean Balkans Middle East Central Asia and Eastern Europe Turkish cuisine is very multicultural with so many different people living across the country s many regions When we create the menu we try to take something from each culture to represent their recipes along with the ingredients found in each area Tutak says He describes how Anatolia brings in Ottoman influence through spice and specialities like dolma stuffed vine leaves while the Black Sea region incorporates an abundance of fish and the southern part of the country is celebrated for using meat such as lamb in kebabs and meze dishes He enthuses about olive trees growing in Turkey s west while seafood along with a vibrancy of fresh vegetables flourishes along the Aegean and Mediterranean coastlines Why you should visit Urla Turkey s new gastronomic star Every element of Turk reflects Tutak s values and experience Drawing inspiration from his time in Scandinavia and Japan he injected a Japandi design aesthetic into the interiors through clean lines wood and stone Yet its Turkish identity shines through in details such as a marble floor featuring Ottoman stars decorative use of the original Turkish alphabet and works by Turkish artists The chef has brought what he calls three acts into the dining experience Upon arriving in the restaurant courtyard diners are presented with a series of small bites cocktails and Turkish wines before moving to the dining room where savoury dishes from the micro seasonal tasting menu are served For act three they move into the kitchen where the team offers insight into the restaurant s culinary philosophy with a pit stop at the pastry section for a series of dessert plates Back in the dining room guests are shown the menu for the first time so they can see what they ve just eaten Meals at Turk change with the seasons but typically begin with acidic flavours before transitioning to bolder stronger smokiness fermentation and umami based flavour profiles says Tutak Together dishes fuse the old and new bringing in food memories street food elements and even references to arts and crafts the colourful presentation of a fish dish for example is inspired by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama Tutak s cured mackerel dish Yayoi Kusama is inspired by the Japanese artist of the same name Photograph by Duygu Turkmen The menu has also included squid shish kebab featuring squid from the northwestern port city of Çannakale with a porcini sauce and fermented caper leaf and suçuk butter Another dish features dry aged lamb chop from Trakya the region in which Istanbul is located with matsutake mushroom tempura and a kokoreç sauce made with sweetbreads cumin kil biber peppers and crispy Denizli pepper A butter honey course meanwhile features wood fired sourdough and three kinds of butter from the Trabzon region including one made from buffalo milk along with organic honey from Erzincan and olive oil produced in Ayvalık from the pollen of flowers grown at high altitudes However the restaurant s most iconic dish according to Tutak is the mussel dolma It s an expression of Turkish street food rice stuffed mussels spiced with cinnamon allspice cumin and black pepper and served with a beer mayonnaise Even the shells are edible as they re crafted from a fruit leather like substance made of squid ink tamarind currants and caramelised onion It s a playful version of something very traditional he says The chef s ultimate aim is to show how diverse Turkish gastronomy can be The image of Turkish cuisine is very limited across the world he says We want to educate guests to show them our vibrancy and unique ingredients They re always surprised by the diversity It s the first time they ve seen Turkish cuisine presented in this way In the future Tutak hopes to become a mentor to the new generation of Turkish chefs and potentially create a foundation to inspire creativity and teach them about the country s culinary history I m a good student always learning from those I meet as I travel around the country he says You need to first be a good student before
