Neighborhoods Neighborhoods Hotels Stay Things To Do Do Where To Eat Eat Need To Know Know The Fodor s Five The five things you need to know before traveling to Charleston Southern hospitality is a real thing in Charleston Southern hospitality is a way of life in the Lowcountry and something Charlestonians take a great deal of pride in There s no shortage of excellent hotels and historic inns to choose from depending on your preferences and price point While many hotels are within walking distance to the city s top attractions be sure to inquire about any unique local offerings and amenities your hotel has to offer and don t miss the opportunity to book an experience directly through your concierge The weather in Charleston varies greatly so plan accordingly Plan for the seasons and pack and plan your visit accordingly If you re traveling during July and August be prepared for high temperatures and lots of humidity In the summer months you might want to plan your activities and sightseeing first thing in the morning to beat the heat and plan on hitting your hotel pool or heading to the beach in the afternoon In the wintertime when the temps drop down at night make sure to bundle up as Charleston does get chilly While fall and spring are both ideal times to visit weather wise you should always be prepared for the possibility of rain You will definitely need to make reservations to snag a table at Charleston s best restaurants Charleston is a place that takes its food and restaurants seriously so no matter the season make sure you book your reservations in advance Charleston based chef Mike Lata suggests choosing a restaurant that s known for cooking local food and planning dinners at your top choices accordingly Don t be afraid to take an earlier or later reservation from there you can always call or email the restaurant and request the time you prefer Lata tells Fodor s There are always lots of cancellations in a tourist market maybe you ll get lucky If you don t get the time you want arrive in advance for a drink and hope to get sat earlier In my opinion good meals while traveling are worth working for There s a lot of culture and history to experience so expect a packed itinerary Charleston is a treasure trove of art history and architecture and there s so much to see learn and discover Don t miss a chance to take a historic walking tour and soak up as much of the city s past as possible Just take care when you re walking and be mindful of the cobblestone streets If mobility presents an issue you can also opt to take a pedicab horse drawn carriage tour or bike around town It s important to note that while Charleston is a very safe and walkable city you should remain vigilant in some parts of town including North Charleston late at night Don t forget to leave Charleston and visit neighboring beach towns Don t miss the chance to explore the surrounding beach towns and Sea Islands Just over the Ravenel Bridge Mount Pleasant is a charming neighborhood with a variety of excellent local eateries and bars Venture a bit further and you ll find Sullivans Island and Isle of Palms both of which are within easy driving distance from Charleston and a great way to take a day trip and experience a slice of the Lowcountry lifestyle Read More Guidebooks for Every Journey Fodor s InFocus Charleston With Hilton Head and
