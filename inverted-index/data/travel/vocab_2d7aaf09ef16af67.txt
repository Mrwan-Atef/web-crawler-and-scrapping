How to see wild Bengal tigers in Jaagir Manor India TRAVEL This is the best place on the planet to search for Bengal tigers Jaagir Manor lies at the pulsating heart of the great Terai ecosystem home to Bengal tigers secretive denizens of this little known wilderness India is home to approximately of the world s wild tigers often found prowling through the grassland of national parks Photograph by Sourabh Bharti Getty Images By Mark Stratton October This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK It s dark when my butler Parvez brings me coffee and cinnamon buns and I reluctantly haul myself out of my four poster bed Amith Bangre my wildlife guide waits in the foyer of Jaagir Manor and we pile sleepily into an open topped vehicle We re heading out to look for tigers in Dudhwa National Park a wilderness of dense forest and open grassland in Uttar Pradesh part of the Terai ecosystem that stretches miles along the India Nepal border The Lower Himalayan air is cold and biting and I burrow deeper into my woollen poncho watching the outlines of farmsteads and sugarcane appear as murky shapes in the dawn Stretching for miles along the India Nepal border Dudhwa National Park is comprised of tall dense sal tree forests and open grassland Photograph by Dinodia Photos Alamy There s two ways we track tigers says Amith as watery sunshine penetrates the sal tree forest casting a starburst light on our surroundings First we look for pawprints because tigers move through the forest on sandy tracks and then we listen for the alarm calls of animals like langur monkeys It s a fresh pawprint perfectly formed and surrounded by morning dew that sends my pulse racing There s one close by whispers Amith We linger for a while yet the tigers of Terai are mercurial We inspect a tree with deep furrowed gouges raking the bark and I subconsciously look from shoulder to shoulder to be sure we have no feline company It s a big male surmises Amith He s letting potential rivals know this is his territory sensational places to see wildlife in India Big male or not in typical catlike fashion he s likely dozing in the undergrowth and despite scouring the shadows nothing stirs Elsewhere however the forest crackles with life Thick furred langurs seem scarcely to need the threat of a tiger to kick up their simian din while eagles screech overhead and unseen critters scurry through dry leaves carpeting the forest floor Particularly special is the lack of other safari vehicles we see almost none for the whole day See a tiger in Ranthambore and there will be twenty vehicles around it says Amith We plan our next tiger foray back at Jaagir where I live a princely existence The white painted manor is pure art deco built and used by British governors as a jungle lodge in the Corinthian columns lining the driveway point towards cosy indulgence with the flamboyance of an eccentric millionaire aunt The white painted Jaagir Manor was built and used as a jungle lodge by British governors in the Photograph by Jaagir Manor My heritage suite one of seven is an original room with a Victorian ambience and a gramophone I gravitate to the colonial style Safari Club lounge with its pool table and bar where I sip a whisky and club soda in front of a crackling fire before heading to the Pavilion dining room The head chef s thali could sink a battleship and I regret my gluttonous over indulgence at high tea that afternoon where the cucumber sandwiches come with crusts removed de rigueur As my tiger quest continues I accrue ever burgeoning sightings of endangered species Dudhwa National Park is a fabulous wetland expanse of swamps and rivers Barking deer bound across our path sloth bears amble adorably from bush to bush and langurs in the tree tops above are I suspect crying wolf Their whooping triggers prove fruitless and I take out my frustration on a packed wicker hamper of parathas stuffed with aloo gobi served on white linen napkins on the Land Rover bonnet before a wondrous afternoon on the river spotting rare river dolphins and slender snouted crocodiles called gharials There s only around gharials left now because of human impacts says Amith sadly On our final foray into the reserve the pesky langurs are at it again But Amith rolls the dice and seeks out their commotion We park at a crossroads The forest around us is truly agitated and wails reverberate through the canopy Look says Amith in a hoarse whisper there she is a female Calm and completely unafraid the exquisite feline appears from the trees She s more orange than I expected the colour of hot embers and she walks alongside the vehicle without so much as changing her stride We watch in silent awe before with a flick of her tail she blends back into the shadows The langurs quieten but I squeal with excitement all the way back to Jaagir Three more wildlife to spot Leopards of Rajasthan Amid the stony billion year old granite hills a leopard s growl carries far on
