A guide to Athens where ancient sites coexist with modern life TRAVEL A guide to Athens where ancient sites coexist with modern life Ancient relics have been given a fresh lease of life in the Greek capital where they ve been reimagined and reworked to coexist with the century city from fashion stores to classical music venues From the Stoa of Attalos Museum the mighty Acropolis can be seen looming over cypress trees and millennia old artefacts Photograph by Marco Argüello By Farida Zeynalova Photographs by Marco Argüello September This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Surrounded by baby clothes and frilly cardigans it s hard to believe I m here to learn about Greek history But beneath the children s department of Zara on Stadiou Street lie the remnants of a Roman tomb There isn t a label or signpost in sight Nothing to say who built it why it s here or when it was discovered Above my head is a reinforced glass panel on which dozens of shoppers unwittingly walk over a mysterious most likely year old artefact Athens is a very alive city says Tina Kyriakis flipping her thick brown ringlets from her face Born in the southern suburbs my guide for the day is founder of the tour companies Alternative Athens and Back to the Routes Look at the city as a living organism she says We don t think OK let s build on top of or repurpose this building it s just a continuity of life a natural progression It s not intentional It s this progression that s led to Athens revealing itself in layers Think of it as an architectural moussaka At the bottom are remnants of the ancient city dating back to the fifth century BCE tucked underneath Metro stations clothes shops and residential buildings In the middle a mixture of its Roman Byzantine Ottoman and neo classical past And finally century Athens the bechamel sauce in this analogy sits on top of everything that came before The best Greek islands to visit in Photographs by Marco Argüello As for this tomb Tina can t tell me much about it What we do know is that the building under which it s built was likely constructed sometime in the late century and once belonged to philanthropist Ioannis Hadjikyriakos Since then it s been a hotel an army base offices and now a clothing store And the glass panel isn t here because the construction workers had a soft spot for Greek antiquity Rather it s enshrined in law says Tina The Greek government stipulates that to build on top of ancient relics they must be left viewable and visitable She s been to houses in Plaka one of the oldest neighbourhoods in Athens where dining tables sit on top of glass panels overlooking all sorts of artefacts It doesn t matter if it s private property if it s old it must be on display Athens has been continuously inhabited since the mid late Neolithic era around BCE so it makes sense that old and new co exist here It doesn t matter where you dig you ll always hit something Tina tells me What are we supposed to do Not build A five minute walk leads us to Aiolou Street where Tina shows me another stark dialogue between old and new The National Bank of Greece Administration Building just off Kotzia Square is made with sand coloured poros stone and black unpolished granite It sits virtually on top of remnants of the city s fifth century BCE walls which once enveloped the Acropolis the Agora public space and the Temple of Zeus Finished in the bank was built so that the remains were left out in the open and visible from a viewing platform just by the entrance The Kotzia Square area was excavated between and to make way for an underground car park Three ancient streets a cemetery and a complex of houses and workshops were unearthed before the car park plans were scrapped When they started building the Administration Building the architects were very conscious of the heritage surrounding it You see how the modern blocks mimic the style and shape of the ancient foundations just below it It s a very conscious decision we had to work around it says Tina Photographs by Marco Argüello Our last stop for the day is Monastiraki Metro Station one of the busiest in Athens We take a lift down to platform level where a glass walkway overlooks an archaeological site excavated during the station s construction The remains ranging from the eighth century BCE to the century are mostly settlements and a small gap between the relics and the information board above reveals the trickling remnants of the Eridanos River Look at how the city gradually rises Each period built on top of the other Tina says pointing to the earliest relics a mishmash of rocks just a few inches off the ground It starts with the early Christian era and just keeps rising Look at the difference between the century and the she continues gesturing to mammoth blocks of stone dating to the What a coexistence that is Odeons past and present The following evening just before sunset I head towards the open air theatre Odeon of Herodes Atticus aka Herodeon to watch renowned Greek composer and conductor Michalis Economou and the ERT National Symphony Orchestra commemorate World Music Day The event is part of the annual three month Athens Epidaurus Festival in which the city comes alive with musical performances and theatre The semi circular seater Herodeon stands staunchly on the southwest side of the mighty Acropolis and was built by Athenian rhetorician Herodes Atticus in CE a date my heat dilapidated mind it s and struggles to comprehend How is it still here Did Herodes think it would stand this long And do the teenagers taking selfies in the corner know that this is the place second century traveller and geographer Pausanias described as the finest building of its type The evening light gives my surroundings a pretty candlelit effect especially the ubiquitous cypress trees and millenia old arches of the changing area behind the stage I climb the steep steps to the top and take my seat Within seconds luminescent fireflies dart in front of me as if they re part of the show The chirps of cicadas and crickets blend with the murmurings of the audience The chequerboard stage is backlit with orange and purple lights I suddenly spot the full moon between a cypress tree and what s left of the second storey arch The solitary stone Philopappos Monument a mausoleum built in the century is poised on Mouseion Hill to the south and looks almost computer generated against the cerulean sky It s mesmerising enough just to sit here before the show has even started Within the walls of Odeon of Herodes Atticus a year old open air theatre visitors can enjoy a variety of music and theatre performances Photograph by Marco Argüello Herodeon s architecture is typically Roman with elaborate arches and a two storey semi circular orchestra pit In the it was restored using Pentellic marble from Mount Pentelicus the same material used to build much of the Acropolis Since then it s continued to serve its original purpose entertainment Pavarotti Frank Sinatra Elton John and Sting have all performed here and Coldplay recently shot their video for Feels Like I m Falling in Love inside the historic venue Suddenly the lights dim and the orchestra takes to the stage The audience falls silent The sedative plinks of the violin open the show and soon the bows dance in unison For the next few hours we re treated to orchestral works by the likes of Shostakovich Tchaikovsky and Chopin drawing to a close around I gingerly make my way down the steps and onto the leafy promenade Dionysiou Areopagitou where I spot the maestro Economou himself Dressed in a black tunic suit and with a head full of short tight curls it s easy to single him out from the crowd I chase him as he hurries through the throng of people eventually cornering him behind a vendor I m desperate to know how it feels to perform at such a remarkable venue It s a disaster he tells me Playing classical pieces in open theatres is very difficult the losses are very practical the trumpets cannot hear the strings for example I definitely prefer closed theatres the orchestra sounds much better But this place obviously has such a magical aura he continues and this kind of balances out the losses The energy of this place combined with art is out of this world I ask him if he thinks it s important to keep the culture of amphitheatres alive and he tells me that their preservation is not up to us These are monuments he says and only history and time decides what survives and what doesn t The next evening I head towards the leafy upscale neighbourhood of Kolonaki in central Athens for a screening of the film Memory at Cine Dexameni The open air cinema has been here since and is one of around in the city scattered around parks wedged in between leafy residential blocks and in this case built on top of a Roman aqueduct constructed years ago Athenians some old others young some dressed up to the nines others super casual make their way up the black and white slate stairs towards their seats The last time I was here the aqueduct completely passed me by but not tonight I grapple with the gate to it but to my horror it s closed because the tank needs maintenance I peep through to catch a glimpse of something that provided Athenians with their water until around the mid century Through one of the windows I can just about make out the stone columns and arches of the aqueduct illuminated by ground spotlights Eventually I accept defeat and head upstairs where I m met with the smell of pine and hot buttery popcorn With a large bottle of Mythos lager in my hand I take a seat right at the back It s the perfect summer s evening When the film starts I wonder who else here is unaware of the history that s present just a few inches below actor Jessica Chastain s face And I think back to something my guide Tina told me earlier in the week If we get out of our Greekality and look at it from the eyes of a stranger Athens is a very mind blowing place How to do it Kirker Holidays offers a three night stay at St George Lycabettus based on two sharing a room including return flights
