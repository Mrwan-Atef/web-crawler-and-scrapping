How Belfast s art and music are helping locals look to the future TRAVEL How Belfast s art and music are helping locals look to the future In the Northern Irish capital the healing and uniting powers of music and art are being used to reconcile the past look to the future and bring communities together Half Bap recording studios is one of the stops along a music tour of Belfast Photograph by Elaine Hill By Richard Franks November This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK I remember this area in the it was a riot quite literally at times says Dolores Vischer as we stroll along Bedford Street in Belfast s Linen Quarter on the southern edge of the city centre I say literally because I remember The Clash turning up for a gig across the street from here in only to be turned away as the venue thought the rowdy punk rock band from England would attract trouble It was true they did she adds as we reach our first stop the Ulster Hall music venue But only because the gig was cancelled I m on a music tour of Belfast with blonde haired local music aficionado and Creative Belfast Tours guide Dolores who s wearing a punkish black leather jacket and corduroy flat peaked cap Earlier she d described how she d once played the drums with British punk band The Stranglers During their gig she d climbed on stage and persuaded the drummer the late Jet Black to let her play along to their hit Peaches He said he needed the toilet anyway so he let me have a go Dolores s music tours on foot and by bus predominantly showcase some of Belfast s homegrown talent Among them is the city s original pop star the late Ruby Murray whose contribution to the city is celebrated with a plaque inside the Ulster Hall In the when she was at her musical height Ruby broke the record as the artist with the most singles in the UK s official Top chart simultaneously five She held on to this until Ed Sheeran released his Divide album in I say to most people if you ve heard of her it s likely from Cockney rhyming slang Dolores says referring to the fact that Ruby Murray is a term for curry that has become ubiquitous in the UK Another local talent is Terri Hooley the Belfast record store and label owner responsible for the success of Northern Irish punk bands like The Undertones and The Outcasts In the film Good Vibrations the final scene depicts the sold out Ulster Hall gig in where Terri announced the closure of the record store on stage and The Outcasts performed a raucous show says Dolores Terri is depicted in a mural on the site of his former record store on Great Victoria Street a few minutes walk from the Linen Quarter The historic Sunflower Pub has stood on the same site since the late Photograph by Elaine Hill Kenny and his dog Charlie busk outside the century Ulster Sports Club venue Photograph by Elaine Hill Belfast is a city known for its grand Victorian and Edwardian architecture and some of the best examples lie along Bedford Street s broad avenue Here the palatial red brick Venetian gothic architecture of the area s former factories stands tall alongside the grand Victorian facade of the Ulster Hall The latter s original features include a wrought iron canopy sheltering its entrance beneath which Charles Dickens the Dalai Lama and Irish rock band have all stood at one point in time or another The Ulster Hall was built in and was intentionally sandwiched between the many linen factories and showrooms that back then lined these pavements says Dolores It was purpose built to entertain the city s growing population which shot up from people in to some a century later and first opened solely with live classical music Today it s very different with everything from comedy to rock and opera to jazz in there Linen was one of the industries that helped Belfast prosper alongside ship building which resulted most notably in RMS Titanic At its early century peak the Belfast region accounted for around linen factories which employed people By the city had overtaken Dublin to become the largest on the island of Ireland And with the booming population came a boom in Belfast s music by this waterside city was a UNESCO City of Music Up until the late everybody wanted to play Belfast but that changed says Dolores pausing to pull out a Bluetooth speaker from her satchel We had all the big bands like The Beatles playing here but for a year period from the onwards most of them stopped coming The reason The Troubles the violent nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland from the late until which saw mostly Protestant unionists who wanted to remain a part of the United Kingdom clashing with mostly Catholic nationalists who wanted Northern Ireland to join the Republic of Ireland Around lives were lost and people were wounded before a resolution was reached The Good Friday Agreement was signed in calling for peace and setting up a new government in Northern Ireland that represented both unionists and nationalists Only one artist repeatedly performed in Belfast during The Troubles Irish singer songwriter Rory Gallagher who was born in Donegal raised in Cork and lived in Belfast He now too has a commemorative plaque inside the Ulster Hall He was one of the only artists to insist on playing here when everyone else refused says Dolores pressing play on his biggest hit Bad Penny a track where his guitar soars over his throaty vocals Most notably in he went ahead with a gig right here in the Ulster Hall even though bombs were going off outside she says He brushed it off by saying everyone was safer inside than out there Gallagher made a point of stopping here on every single Irish tour during that time which meant his music was widely seen as an escape from The Troubles It brought both sides Catholic and Protestant together for a couple of hours which nobody else could seem to do The city center of Belfast has several markets and sights to see Photograph by Elaine Hill Writing on the walls Remnants of The Troubles can still be found in Belfast decades since the peace agreement was signed The following day I find political murals depicting the period on the Falls and Shankill roads including a kaleidoscopic depiction of Bobby Sands the IRA leader who died on hunger strike in prison in At the Sunflower pub a minute walk north from the Linen Quarter a security cage from the remains as a relic of social history A black metal sign on the side reads no topless sunbathing Ulster has suffered enough The city is anti establishment due to its politics says guide Adam Turkington stroking his ginger beard outside the pub and pointing at the cage which was used as a checkpoint during The Troubles to identify people before entering the bar He leads street art tours of Belfast every Sunday This reflects in the city s music punk is the obvious one but also art They re both important Adam heads up Seedhead Arts a Belfast based street art collective that over the past decade has provided painting opportunities for hundreds of artists worldwide Their popular Hit the North Festival sees thousands of artists descend on Belfast each May where they paint murals everywhere from the ends of terraced houses to lampposts soundtracked by music from artists like David Holmes a Belfast electronic DJ and producer The Duke of York in Belfast s city center draws crowds of tourists looking to have a good time Photograph by Elaine Hill A decade ago we were tasked with painting derelict shop shutters on North Street in an area that had been left to go to ruin by developers he says adding that s where the name for the festival came from Street art used to paper over the cracks but now Belfast is a fertile ground for it We eventually reach our destination the Ulster Sports Club music venue Here we find a mural of a punk with neon green spiked hair on the venue s gabled wall laid back on a sofa and holding a baseball bat in front of a smashed up TV Alter your native land is sprayed beside it lyrics from Stiff Little Fingers Alternative Ulster punk anthem This is how music and art combine in this city Adam says with a nod I think Northern Ireland understands art more than most places due to our rich mural traditions he adds saying that the art is typically inspired by historic events During The Troubles street art became even more popular Whether it s in the city centre or on one of the peace walls which still separate unionist and nationalist communities the writing you see on the walls here is so political Later that day I can t help but gravitate back to Ulster Hall the city s spiritual home of punk rebellion But rather than crashing riffs and pogoing punks my visit is timed with a performance of a different sort Heading inside passing the plaques dedicated to Ruby Murray and Rory Gallagher I take a seat in the auditorium I m here to see one of Belfast s other little known cultural exports opera Tonight it s the turn of the strong NI Opera Chorus with a showcase featuring a snippet from Tchaikovsky s Eugene Onegin Each of the performers was selected from open auditions in Belfast I watch as the full chorus dressed in black perform classical works like Mozart s haunting Requiem in D Minor backed by the warming tones of the old pipe organ Then soprano Mary McCabe playing the lead role of Tatyana floats across the stage in a mauve gown to perform The Letter Scene with soaring vocals during which she declares her love for the lead Eugene Onegin In this moment the music is so beautiful that all thought of what lies beyond the historic doors of the Ulster Hall are forgotten just as they were in the days of Rory Gallagher All that matters is we re all together enjoying the performance This story was created with the support
