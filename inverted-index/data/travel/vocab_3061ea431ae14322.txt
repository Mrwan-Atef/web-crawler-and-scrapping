Lonely Planet Editors Jan min read Share Iconic public artworks stud Millennium Park in downtown Chicago Rolf Shutterstock Millennium Park is one of the top spots to visit in Chicago packed with fun and free things to do Facing Lake Michigan on the edge of the Loop Chicagoâ s showpiece green space shines with whimsical public art but where do you start amid all these landmark artworks Perhaps with the Jay Pritzker Pavilion the swooping silver band shell designed by Frank Gehry Or maybe Jaume Plensaâ s Crown Fountain with its human gargoyles Or why not Anish Kapoorâ s silvery sculpture Cloud Gate â aka â the Beanâ â in Grainger Plaza Or maybe someplace away from the crowds like the veiled Lurie Garden abloom with prairie flowers Right in the heart of downtown Chicago Millennium Park is the perfect place to relax explore and soak up the city skyline views This guide will walk you through the parkâ s history its must see attractions and all the best things to do in Millennium Park Advertisement Millennium Park is one of Chicago s most successful urban redevelopment projects Pamela Brick Shutterstock Discover the history of Millennium Park Millennium Park wasnâ t always the beautiful space it is today The area was once an unkempt rail yard before civic planners got their way Millennium Park was originally slated to open in the year to coincide with the Millennium celebrations hence the name but construction delays and escalating costs pushed back the inauguration With costs far exceeding the original million budget the project seemed headed for disaster but private donations from families such as the Pritzkers and Crowns and corporate donors such as Boeing provided an additional million to complete the project All in the final bill came to million but it was worth it Today the park is one of the largest green roofs in the world constructed on top of hidden parking garages and a commuter train station Anish Kapoor s Cloud Gate â also known as the Bean â changes mood with the seasons MarynaG Shutterstock Top things to do in Millennium Park Millennium Park is filled with activity year round From interactive sculptures to scenic bridges here are the highlights to make time for on any visit Anish Kapoorâ s Cloud Gate The parkâ s biggest draw is â the Beanâ â officially titled Cloud Gate â Anish Kapoorâ s ton silver drop sculpture It reflects both the sky and the skyline and everyone clamors around to take a picture and touch its silvery smoothness The best vantage points for photos are at the sculptureâ s northern and southern ends For great people watching go up the steps on Washington St where there are shaded benches The Bean wasnâ t always so well loved Kapoor was still polishing and grinding the stainless steel plates that create the sculptureâ s mirrored surface when the city first unveiled the sculpture to the public in The surface was supposed to be seamless â and it is now â but soon after its debut it went back under wraps so the artist could finish the job It didnâ t re emerge until To keep the Bean gleaming park staff hose the sculpture down with water and squeegee its surface daily Twice a year it gets a thorough cleaning with gallons of liquid detergent Planning Tip Visit early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid the crowds and get the best photos Crown Fountain Jaume Plensaâ s Crown Fountain is another crowd pleaser Two high glass block towers display videos of a thousand different faces â the people shown are all native Chicagoans who agreed to be strapped into Plensaâ s special dental chair where he immobilized their heads for filming Each face puckers up and spurts water mimicking the gargoyles atop Parisâ Notre Dame Cathedral In the winter when the fountain is dry a fresh set of non puckering faces appears on the screens Advertisement Planning Tip On hot days the fountain is packed with locals splashing in the streams to cool off Itâ s especially good for kids but bring a towel to dry off after The Jay Pritzker Pavilion hosts everything from orchestral performances to exercise classes stevegeer Getty Images Jay Pritzker Pavilion Impressive both acoustically and architecturally Millennium Parkâ s band shell â the Jay Pritzker Pavilion â was designed by architect Frank Gehry who gave this popular performance space his signature swooping style Supposedly the design was inspired by the silvery carp used to make gefilte fish â a classic Jewish dish As a child Gehry watched his grandmother make the dish every week and became fascinated by the fishâ s shape and movement The pipes crisscrossing over the lawn are studded with speakers delivering high quality sound throughout the space From mid June to August the pavilion hosts free concerts at on weekdays or thereâ s a performance on Saturdays Mondays and Thursdays typically feature R B jazz or world music while Wednesdays Fridays and Saturdays are dedicated to classical performances often featuring the renowned Grant Park Orchestra On Tuesdays movies are shown on the large screen above the stage Seats are available close to the stage in the pavilion arrive early to grab one or you can relax on the grassy Great Lawn For all shows â especially classical performances by the top notch Grant Park Orchestra â people bring blankets picnics wine and beer Thereâ s nothing quite like sitting on the lawn looking up through Gehryâ s iconic grid and seeing a grand parade of skyscrapers forming a visual backdrop to the soaring music The pavilion also offers daytime activities Concert rehearsals take place Tuesday to Friday usually from to giving visitors a chance to enjoy the music even if they miss the evening performances Planning Tip On Saturday mornings the Great Lawn transforms into a fitness center with free exercise classes starting at Instructors lead sessions in Pilates yoga strength training and Zumba dance â a fun way to get active in a beautiful setting The Lurie Garden recreates an Illinois prairie in the middle of Chicago Chuck Eckert Getty Images Lurie Garden If the crowds at the Bean Crown Fountain and Jay Pritzker Pavilion feel overwhelming head to the peaceful Lurie Garden This secluded space uses native plant species to create a botanical tribute to Illinoisâ tallgrass prairies Many visitors miss the garden because itâ s tucked behind a high hedge In spring yellow coneflowers poetâ s daffodils bluebells and other stunning blooms cover this acre oasis and all the plants are grown sustainably without chemicals Youâ ll find Lurie Garden at the southeastern end of Millennium Park with a small stream running through the center dividing it into two parts The Dark Plate section showcases thick shady vegetation while the Light Plate section features sunny warm and open landscaping Visitors often dip their feet in the water to cool off and relax Harris Theater The Harris Theater anchors the parkâ s northern edge on Randolph St This is Chicagoâ s premier midsize venue and it offers some of the cityâ s hottest tickets More than cutting edge performing arts troupes call it home from the Chicago Opera Theater to Ballet Chicago and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago In particular the Harris is the epicenter of the cityâ s thriving dance scene The BP Bridge is another of Frank Gehry s eye catching designs Kit Leong Shutterstock BP Bridge Nichols Bridgeway In addition to the Jay Pritzker Pavilion architect Frank Gehry also designed the snaking BP Bridge that spans Columbus Drive This luminous sheet metal walkway connects Millennium Park from the back of the Great Lawn to Maggie Daley Park which offers activities such as ice skating and rock climbing The bridge also offers fantastic views of the Chicago skyline The Nichols Bridgeway is another pedestrian only span designed by Renzo Piano This sleek silver bridge arches from Millennium Park over Monroe St to the floor sculpture terrace at the Art Institute of Chicago which is free to visit Piano also designed the museumâ s Modern Wing where the sculpture terrace is located McCormick Tribune Ice Rink Tucked between the Bean and the twinkling lights of Michigan Ave the McCormick Tribune Ice Rink is a winter favorite Operating from late November to early March itâ s easily the most scenic ice skating rink in the city Admission is free with skate rentals available for around In the summer the rink transforms into an alfresco seating area for the Millennium Hall restaurant Wrigley Square Boeing Gardens The large plaza at the corner of Michigan Ave and Randolph St is Wrigley Sq and the Greek style structure rising above it is the Millennium Monument a replica of the original peristyle that stood here from to This semicircular row of Doric columns towers nearly high and while it contrasts with the modern art found throughout the park it was conceived as a way to connect the past with the present The Boeing Galleries are located at the northern and southern ends of the park These outdoor spaces feature rotating exhibits of contemporary sculpture and photo murals offering something new to see with every visit The best way to take in the sights at Millennium Park is on foot MisterStock Shutterstock Getting around Millennium Park Millennium Park is located in The Loop making it easily accessible by bus the elevated trains of the L

Where to eat and drink nearby Dining near Millennium Park is easy with plenty of options nearby Millennium Hall located under the Bean offers pizza tacos and craft beer For something more casual pack a picnic and enjoy it on the Great Lawn Just north of the park Marianoâ s grocery store at E Benton Pl is perfect for grabbing snacks and drinks Top planning tips The park has multiple entrances During the day many visitors enter via the Washington St and Madison St entrances but during the evening when there are concerts at the Jay Pritzker Pavilion all visitors must enter from either Randolph St or Monroe St to go through a security check Entrances and bag check lines open minutes before the start of concerts To get unobstructed views of the Bean or Crown Fountain visit in the early morning or later in the evening Check the weather forecast many park activities take place outdoors so be prepared with sunscreen and a hat or an umbrella depending on the season The park covers
