destination Nicola Williams Mar min read Share Choose the best time for your visit to Sicily with this seasonal guide Â Chiara Magi Shutterstock With its sizzling hot beaches and choice of three blue seas to dip in summer has always been the hottest time of year to visit Sicily Yet thereâ s so much more to Italyâ s paradise island than flopping on gold or black sand with Augustâ s ferragosto holiday crowd cooling off over a riot of water based activities and toasting endless long summer days with an Aperol spritz Advertisement Each Sicilian month has its own beauty This coupled with the cultural heavyweightâ s portfolio of world class monuments and museums makes the island an appealing destination all year As already scorching summer temperatures seem to spiral increasingly higher the cooler shoulder seasons are becoming more fashionable Couple this with a surge in slow meditative exploration through rural landscapes and traditions â both of which Sicily boasts in spades â and you have the making of a whole new best season to visit Sicily Note breakfasting on a sweet brioche bun dunked into blackberry granita and breaking mid afternoon for creamy gelato crafted from island almonds figs or pistachios is perfectly acceptable every month of the year Spring and fall months are ideal for exploring Sicily s ruins without the crowds Â oriredmouse Getty Images April May September and October are best for outdoor action and epicurean pleasures With fairly reliable sunshine and the mercury hovering at a pleasant F C or so spring and early fall are ideal for winding along precipitous coastlines on foot scaling volcanoes â Mount Etna in eastern Sicily and Stromboli on the eponymous Aeolian island â and hiking through flower strewn meadows and up craggy peaks in the mountainous interior Even with the milder temperatures the Sicilian sun is fierce bring a sunhat sun protection and ample water before hitting trails and archeological sites such as Valley of the Temples Segesta and Selinunte where there is no or little shade On the coast you can beach lounge and sea dip without feeling like a sardine May ushers in top drawer diving and snorkeling until October in waters around Sicilyâ s offshore islands diving schools in Ustica Lipari and Lampedusa typically open mid April to late October Accommodation prices remain reasonable and sights are blissfully uncrowded More importantly it is warm enough to lap up Sicilyâ s chill cafe vibe and enjoy its banquet of traditional cuisine al fresco â terraces in Palermo Catania and smaller towns mushroom outside in early spring and operate well into October Advertisement For epicureans springtime stalls at Palermoâ s Mercato del Capo and Cataniaâ s fruit and veg market by its legendary La Pescheria fish market are piled high with asparagus artichokes fennel fava beans and honey sweet strawberries Traditional sagre food festivals celebrating grape olive chestnut and pistachio harvests pepper September Bronteâ s pistachio festival San Vito La Capoâ s couscous festival and Castelbuonoâ s mushroom fest in October are well worth planning a trip around You ll be sharing Sicily s beaches with plenty of people in the summer months Â leonori Shutterstock June to August are best for cooling sea dips beach life and festivals Though scorching hot and often crowded with vacationers Sicilyâ s beaches are the place to be in summer with their dreamy blue waters and always spectacular views In Palermo striped sun shades are draped full length over apartment balconies by and on the coast parasol shaded sun loungers at private beach clubs fill fast Come armed with water shoes to scamper into the sea â pebbles and rocks can be as hot as coals by noon in July and August Alongside its searing temperatures rendering an afternoon siesta the only sensible option August can raise the curtain on the Sirocco wind this hot and fierce hairdryer wind blows in from the south and can reach near hurricane speeds Occasionally dust from the North African deserts reddens Sicilian skies and temperatures soar When the sun goes down and temperatures cool open air concerts film screenings and theater performances are a dime a dozen From May to July world class actors perform at Syracuse s century BCE amphitheater during the Festival del Teatro Greco Catania s four night world music festival Marranzano raises the curtain on a glittering cast of international artists at historic monastery Monastero dei Benedettini in June while a summertime ticket to a Taormina Arte performance at Tormina s Teatro Greco is Sicilian gold On the eco conscious Aeolian Islands do your bit in July at Stromboliâ s Festa di Teatro Ecologico ushering in days of theater dance and music â no electricity involved â on an open air stage on the island Make your way to Sicily in February and March for one of the island s many festivals Â Wead Shutterstock February and March ring in religious celebrations street parties and almond blossoms Sicilian skies are not always sunny and temperatures remain cool but the period around Easter is a lens on local tradition Many towns celebrate carnival on Mardi Gras â one of the most flamboyant is in Sciacca on the southwest coast Easter festivities climax in Trapani where traditional guilds parade life sized wooden statues of the Virgin Mary and other Biblical figures through the streets for four days during the mesmerizing La Processione dei Misteri Patron saint celebrations are equally festive one million odd Catanians follow a silver reliquary of St Agata through the city streets during Catania s Festa di Sant Agata in early February Almost as spectacular this month are the islandâ s blossoming almond trees notably celebrated at Agrigentoâ s Valley of the Temples with Sagra del Mandorlo in Fiore â an almond blossom festival with folkloric music and dance between the ruins November to January is the best time for budget travel Sicilyâ s low season sees traditional beach towns and offshore islands in the Aeolian and Egadi archipelagos largely shut down Many hotels restaurants beach clubs and hydrofoil routes close completely for a couple of months Inland temperatures can dip to C or below Yet this is when accommodation rates island wide can drop by or more a long weekend break in Palermo a week off grid amid the forests of the Parco delle Madonie or an off the beaten track adventure in northeastern Sicilyâ s Nebrodi mountains will be a bargain for visitors traveling on a budget Blockbuster churches museums and galleries can be enjoyed in peace and relative solitude Dining is more spontaneous â no need to worry about making table reservations weeks in advance at the most popular addresses Mt Etna and the highest peaks of the Madonie and Nebrodi mountains are typically snow capped from December to late March January is the best month to hit the slopes in the low key ski resorts of Piano Provenzana and Piana Battaglia
