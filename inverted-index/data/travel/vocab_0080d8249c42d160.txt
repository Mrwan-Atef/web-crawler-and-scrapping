wildlife Photograph by Bob Christian Getty Images By Zoey Goto September This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK You can tell a lot about a place from the way it greets its guests In the city of St John s the capital of Newfoundland an island off Canada s eastern coast visitors are inducted into the city with a screech in ceremony a ritual involving downing a shot of rum at a bar and reciting some local dialect before bestowing a kiss on a glassy eyed codfish This welcome a nod to the time when fish was traded for Jamaican rum sets the tone for a destination that s set adrift from the mainland both geographically and culturally and where things are done a little differently St John s remote location on Newfoundland s easterly tip has long been part of its windswept charm In the summer it offers ringside seats to everything from migrating whales and puffins to colossal icebergs But access to the city s rugged coastline became a less arduous trek in May

innovative restaurants for its fusion of Newfoundland and Southeast Asian cuisine while nearby Chinched is a deli serving nose to tail delicacies including crispy pig ears Walk your meal off with a stroll through Downtown whose streets are lined with rows of wooden houses painted in a rainbow of colours Legend has it that the hues guided fisherfolk back to their homes in the fog which hangs heavy in the air during winter and spring On a clear day a mile long hike from Downtown to Signal Hill topped by a castle like structure that received the first transatlantic wireless message in rewards with scenes of untamed bluffs For those making the ascent The Battery Cafe offers a cosy pit stop for a coffee with an optional dash of Canadian maple syrup From the peak follow the Ladies
