Paddling Minnesota s ancient superhighway Sunrise brings pink and purple mist to Minnesota s Saganaga Lake one of many threading the Border Route a historically important Indigenous trading passage that has become popular with adventure travelers PHOTOGRAPH BY BRYAN HANSEL TRAVEL Paddling Minnesota s ancient superhighway The mile Border Route offers big adventure solitude wildlife and thousands of years of human history By Stephanie Pearson April min read I have never wanted to quit something so much in my entire life says Emily Ford The year old explorer from Duluth Minnesota had good reason to give up on her February attempt to be the first Black woman to solo ski across the state s northern Border Route an ambitious mile journey that follows the thin blue line of lakes and rivers that separates the United States and Canada Of the few adventurers who attempt it every year most paddle the route which links Voyageurs National Park the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and Lake Superior in the summer But Ford accompanied by her dog Diggins chose to ski it pulling her gear in a sled facing open water ripping winds and minus degree temperatures The nadir of the trip was the day Ford fell through the ice wearing most of her clothing She survived by quickly starting a fire to dry out which took until a m On the flipside she experienced near complete solitude running into less than a thimbleful of people the entire time That s part of the allure of traversing this pristine albeit difficult wilderness As climate change increases the likelihood of the northern Minnesota forests going up in smoke fires in late summer shut the area down for the first time the Border Route is becoming an increasingly coveted journey Not only is this region ideal for finding solitude among the freshwater lakes lined by granite outcroppings and towering pines it retraces one of the most important Indigenous transportation routes in North America portions of which are still used by the Ojibwe also known as Chippewa today It s literally the one place I ve been where there s no hustle and bustle says Ford The only thing to do is move make it to your next camping spot and realize the beauty around you From gorgeous lakes to ancient pictographs to thriving Indigenous communities here s what travelers can find on this once in a lifetime journey The ancient superhighway For centuries Minnesota s original inhabitants including the Cree Dakota Ojibwe Assiniboine and their descendants used the Border Route as a watery superhighway part of the mile trade network between Montreal and Lake Athabasca They knew these networks as well as a modern traveler knows the U S Interstate Highway System Until the last century nobody traveled by roads in Minnesota says Anton Treuer a professor of Ojibwe at Bemidji State University The only way to get around was by water The rivers and lakes were the highways and arteries that connected the Indigenous people throughout the world This photo shows Great Britain s North West Company headquarters circa in Grand Portage National Monument one of the most important fur trading posts in North America in the century Library of Congress In a Cree guide named Auchagah drew a map on birch bark for the French Canadian military officer Pierre Gualtier de Varennes sieur de La Vérendrye the first agent of New France to be stationed west of Lake Superior His job was to find a passage to the Pacific Ocean The map connected the settlement of Grand Portage on the northern shore of Lake Superior to Lake Winnipeg hundreds of miles to the northwest The map gave the French a foothold into the interior to trade for beaver pelts a fur coveted by century fashionistas from London to Paris to Moscow Here s why northern Minnesota is one of Nat Geo s Best of the World destinations The route s first obstacle an mile long uphill overland footpath from Lake Superior known as the Grand Portage It allowed paddlers to bypass the last miles of the Pigeon River a section with dangerous waterfalls including one that dropped feet between sheer cliffs The wooded trail around it however wasn t much easier climbing feet through thick buggy boreal forest all our people in dismay at the length of the portage three leagues mutinied and loudly demanded that I should turn back Le Vérendrye later wrote in a report But the men pushed on and the route became the fastest way into fur country for the voyageurs as these traders were known More than half a century later Grand Portage was the hub for a hundred fur trading posts in a thousand mile range A modern adventure The Border Route is the path of least resistance You can easily see why this route was used for hundreds if not for thousands of years It has long lakes and long portages explains Dave Freeman a former National Geographic Adventurer of the Year who has traveled the route several times once with his wife Amy Freeman as part of an mile three year journey across North America by kayak canoe and dogsled Amy and Dave Freeman paddle from Partridge Falls on the Pigeon River just outside the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Photograph by Bryan Hansel Navigating these lakes and rivers in winter or summer requires skill and perseverance Some of these lakes are more like inland seas Rainy Lake is square miles Lac La Croix is square miles and Saganaga Lake toward the eastern end covers square miles In winter falling through the ice is one of the biggest risks In summer wind creates dangerous waves on the enormous bodies of water Big water makes bigger waves that could swamp a canoe especially in a significant wind says Amy Freeman You might want to do it in July when the water is warm and fairly benign There is no official starting point but most paddlers travel the route from west to east to take advantage of the prevailing west winds History buffs launch their canoes near Ontario s Fort Frances on Rainy Lake the site of the first European settlement west of Lake Superior established in To avoid an international border crossing some launch miles east at Minnesota s Rainy Lake Visitors Center in Voyageurs National Park Voyageurs National Park is the best place to see northern lights in the U S Since so many of the rivers require portaging the only tangible upstream current is miles of Granite River that connects Saganaga Lake to Gunflint Lake on the second half of the journey Shortly after the Granite River at the foot summit of the mile long Height of Land portage the Border Route crosses the Laurentian Divide and water begins to flow south into Lake Superior Dave Freeman portages his canoe around Partridge Falls on the Pigeon River Photograph by Bryan Hansel The official end point is always the same the shore of Lake Superior the largest of the Great Lakes at the end of the Grand Portage Unfortunately for Emily Ford open water at the Pigeon River forced her to abort her winter trip early on March In days she skied miles from Crane Lake in Voyageurs National Park east to South Fowl Lake in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Still Ford raised more than at press time for the nonprofit Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness The money will be used for kids from diverse backgrounds to take a week long camping trip in the iconic destination I m hoping that me physically being outside in a place like this reduces the fear of being outside alone for people of color says Ford who completed a solo mile thru hike of Wisconsin s Ice Age Trail last winter It s really unusual for people to do that long of a trip says Jason Zabokrtsky owner of Ely Outfitting Company which has provided logistics and other support for paddlers attempting the Border Route It s a trip you have to grow into This mile canoe route is an unforgettable way to see New England Linking to the past It s a badge of honor to complete the Border Route Attempting it offers the chance to understand the area s history and its original inhabitants whose descendants still live in northern Minnesota Canoeists paddle by pictographs on cliffs bordering Lac La Croix in Minnesota s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness There are pictographs in more than two dozen sites in the area dating back to years Photograph by Layne Kennedy Getty Images The whole place is still their land says Ty Olson an American filmmaker who completed a winter Border Route crossing in March to reckon with what it means to be a white settler The highlight on his day journey was serendipitously meeting a trio of snowmobilers from the Lac La Croix First Nation a remote settlement of a few hundred Ojibwe known as Saulteaux in Canada across the border in Canada There are Ojibwe First Nations in Canada and the same number of Ojibwe bands across the U S seven of which are in Minnesota Several of the Canadian Ojibwe still live in settlements along the route says Treuer adding we re not just an ancient historical presence Uncovering Native American history in Badlands National Park On Lac La Croix near a high bluff known as Warrior Hill on the Canadian shoreline there are dozens of handprints and animal figures A bull moose with a big rack stained in red ochre is painted on a cliff face that drops dramatically into the water The pictographs in one of more than two dozen sites in the region are estimated to be between to years old On Knife Lake in the Boundary Waters flint knapped siltstone artifacts date back to the Paleo Indians the first people to inhabit the region when the glaciers receded to years ago One of the beauties of the Border Route as Treuer says is that visitors can experience living within an Indigenous framework as part of a circle of life not its master Hike with us National Geographic s Trails
