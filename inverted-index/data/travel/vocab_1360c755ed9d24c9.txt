Lonely Planet Editors Jan min read Share Chicago is the setting for some of the most iconic architecture in America Joe Daniel Price Getty Images High flying architecture is everywhere in Chicago the birthplace of the skyscraper but the cityâ s prairie roots shine through too in Frank Lloyd Wrightâ s love of horizontal lines as long as the Midwestern horizon The Great Chicago Fire left a blank slate and sparked an architectural revolution and the city has been a hotbed for innovative architecture ever since Taking an architecture themed river cruise is one of the most popular things to do in Chicago and for good reason No matter what tops your must see list on a trip to the Windy City you can experience the beauty of Chicagoâ s architecture and gain a deeper understanding of its history From beaux arts to art deco this guide explores Chicagoâ s best architecture and its rich history including must visit Chicago landmarks and the tours that will take you there Advertisement The horizontal lines of Frank Lloyd Wright s Robie House were a tribute to the American praries Mario Savoia Shutterstock Chicago architectural movements Chicagoâ s landmark architecture can be divided into several distinctive architectural movements that are easy to discover on a trip to the city The Prairie School Frank Lloyd Wright a protÃ gÃ of father of skyscrapers Louis Sullivan endowed Chicago with its most distinctive style â the Prairie School considered the first uniquely American form of architecture The movement s buildings sought to mirror their place in the plains emphasizing the horizontal over the vertical with long low roof lines and rows of windows that seamlessly connect indoor spaces with the outdoors To blend in with the landscape visually natural materials such as brick limestone and stucco were often used Wright called this â organic architecture â inspired by and aiming to exist harmoniously with nature Of all the Prairie style houses designed by Wright Robie House on South Woodlawn Ave in Chicagoâ s South Side is the most dramatic and successful with a cantilevered roof and art glass windows embellished with a geometric wheat stalk design Driving is the easiest way to reach the house as public transport can only drop you a few blocks away Key architects Frank Lloyd Wright is one of the USAâ s most notable architects he catapulted the Prairie style to global renown and coined the term â organic architecture â Marion Mahony Griffin was the first woman licensed to practice architecture in Illinois and a founding member of the Prairie School â she was an early hire at Frank Lloyd Wright s practice The ornate ceiling of the Chicago Cultural Center is a classic example of beaux arts architecture Arpad Benedek Getty Images Beaux Arts Despite so much forward looking and America focused architecture the buildings constructed for the Worldâ s Exposition the first Chicago Worldâ s Fair were a salute to a European past The beaux arts movement named for the Ã cole des Beaux Arts in Paris took after a French fad that stressed influences from antiquity The style mixes classical Roman and Greek elements such as stately columns cornices and facades crowded with statuary Daniel Burnham was the master planner behind the Worldâ s Fairâ s grand whitewashed buildings which earned the project the nickname of the â White City â The Palace of Fine Arts now the Griffin Museum of Science Industry is the only surviving structure but beaux arts became Chicagoâ s dominant architectural paradigm for the next two decades This is evidenced by some of the cityâ s best known civic landmarks including the Art Institute of Chicago and the Chicago Cultural Center both accessible on foot along Michigan Ave in the Loop Key architect Daniel Burnham was the principal architect of the Worldâ s Fair and a champion of beaux arts and the City Beautiful movement which emphasized the social benefits of creating liveable architecture His Plan of Chicago is a foundational document of American urban planning Advertisement The Chicago Board of Trade is an art deco gem and a Loop landmark Conchi Martinez Shutterstock Art Deco After the decline in the popularity of beaux arts Chicagoâ s architects found inspiration in another French movement â art deco Instead of classical columns and statues deco architects prioritized sharp angles geometric elements reflective surfaces and a modern palette of black silver and green Many of Chicagoâ s best examples can be found in the Loop The Carbide Carbon Building on Michigan Ave was designed by Burnhamâ s two sons and it now houses the Pendry Hotel The building has a unique polished black granite and green terracotta exterior thatâ s topped by a gold leaf accented crown supposedly designed to look like a foil wrapped champagne bottle Another downtown deco landmark is the Chicago Board of Trade on West Jackson Blvd created by Holabird Root the city s oldest still operating architecture firm It remained the cityâ s tallest skyscraper until when the Richard J Daley Center opened on West Washington St Key architects The Burnham Brothers â Daniel Hudson Burnham Jr and Hubert Burnham â continued their father s innovation using new architectural motifs Other noteworthy Chicago art deco pioneers include the design practice Holabird Root creators

director of the Bauhaus he created a series of distinctive buildings in Europe alongside fellow German innovator Walter Gropius and Swiss French modernist Le Corbusier before fleeing the Nazis for the United States Under his direction the steel frame that revolutionized Chicagoâ s skyline once again became seminal though it was now no longer hidden away inside the walls Miesâ guiding philosophy was â less is more â and Chicagoâ s skyscrapers from this era are all about exposed metal and glass His masterpiece is the Chicago Federal Center on South Dearborn St made up of the Kluczynski Federal Building and the Dirksen Federal Building which demonstrate the open universal spaces and minimalist vertical I beams he favored Both are close to Jackson station on the L Key architect Ludwig Mies van der Roheâ s â less is moreâ motto and simple boxy designs created the defining style of modern skyscrapers After working as director of the Bauhaus before fleeing the Nazis he became the head of architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology designing of the campus buildings The antenna topped Willis Tower is one of the most recognizable structures on the Chicago skyline Joe Daniel

they stretched the modern skyscraper even higher in with the John Hancock Center known today as N Michigan Ave â swing by for dizzying views from the Chicago observation deck Another leap forward came in with the construction of the Sears Tower on South Wacker Dr which kept its crown as the worldâ s tallest building for almost a quarter century Now called the Willis Tower it remained the USAâ s tallest building until So far the century in Chicago has been marked by more architectural triumphs including Millennium Park and Frank Gehryâ s sculpted steel Pritzker Pavilion on the lakeshore
