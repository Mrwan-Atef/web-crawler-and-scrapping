some of Vietnamâ s best cultural culinary and natural offerings â such as Bai Tu Long Bay Pascal Boegli Getty Images The siren song of Vietnam has drawn countless travelers to its shores in search of incredible landscapes pearl white beaches chaotic and vibrant cities and some of the best hospitality youâ ll find anywhere The tough decision for travelers isnâ t whether they should visit Vietnam Given the countless options itâ s how they choose to visit Do you start in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City HCMC Do you swap the big city experience for the beaches and seafood suppers of Phu Quoc Island Do you look backward and explore the history of a dozen rival empires Or embrace the dynamic modern Vietnam that has emerged from the crucible of conflict As exciting as such planning is youâ ll unfortunately need to accept that youâ ll never cover everything in one trip Embrace this reality as a reason to return over and over With that caveat out of the way here are ideas to get you excited about your next trip to Vietnam At both deluxe restaurants and street food stalls you can taste Hueâ s amazing flavors ngoc tran Shutterstock Get your fill of imperial cuisine in handsome Hue Vietnamâ s Nguyen Dynasty held court in Hue until and the cityâ s damaged but still impressive historic structures feel closer to imperial China than to the rest of Southeast Asia For many travelers though Hue is all about the food More than half of Vietnamâ s estimated local dishes are believed to have originated here from vermicelli noodle based bun bo Hue and crispy banh khoai pancakes topped with shrimp and pork to canapÃ like soft and crunchy banh it ram dumplings The lavish imperial cuisine known as am thuc cung dinh â created by the emperorsâ loyal chefs â can still be sampled in some of Hueâ s top restaurants such as Thin Gia Vien and Hoang Phu Advertisement Planning tip Donâ t restrict yourself to posh imperial banquets For less than US you can gorge on tasty Hue staples at busy stalwart restaurants such as Madam Thu or at food stalls on the streets Learn to make soups stir fries and salads during a cooking class Thereâ s no better souvenir to bring home from Vietnam than the ability to prepare your own Vietnamese feast Indeed Vietnamese food probably has more dinner party cachet than better known Thai cuisine Up and down the country youâ ll find cooking courses that start with a trip to the market to buy fresh ingredients and local herbs and end with a banquet of the dishes youâ ve prepared covering everything from summer rolls to pho noodle soup Hoi An is the most popular destination for aspiring chefs we recommend small and personal Green Bamboo Cooking School There are also good cooking schools in Hue Hanoi and HCMC The Hue tombs connect visitors with Vietnamâ s imperial past Sergii Figurnyi Shutterstock Meet Vietnamâ s imperial leaders in the Hue tombs Hue gets a second spot on the list thanks to its astounding imperial tombs which preserve the mortal remains of a string of Nguyen emperors and empresses These range from dynasty founding Gia Long to Khai Dinh the last Nguyen emperor to be buried on Vietnamese soil his son Bao Dai the final emperor of Vietnam was interred in the CimetiÃ re de Passy in Paris While crowds mob the Citadel and Imperial Enclosure you can still find peaceful moments for contemplation by skipping the boat tours and renting a motorbike to visit the extravagant mausoleums along the Perfume River Donâ t miss the towering Thien Mu pagoda which looms over the north bank on the city fringes Detour Equipped with two wheels you can also buzz north from Hue to enjoy unspoiled dune beaches on the sandy barrier island stretching north and south from Thuan An Make a stop in Tay Ninh to learn about the Cao Dai faith which incorporates tenets and iconography from various traditions RM Nunes Shutterstock Stop by the Cao Dai Holy See in Tay Ninh One of the worldâ s youngest faiths the Cao Dai religion was founded in the southern town of Tay Ninh in The religion fuses elements of ancestor worship folk religions Confucianism Taoism Buddhism and Roman Catholicism with the ultimate goal of freeing the soul from the endless cycle of reincarnation To explore its complex customs head to the cathedral like Cao Dai Holy See in Tay Ninh Inside youâ ll see a range of iconography including weapon toting statues an all seeing eye and even a Communist like red star The sect reveres among other figures Jesus Christ Buddha Muhammad and even French novelist Victor Hugo Planning tip Visitors can enter the shrine to witness prayers four times a day If you have time to kill before or after a visit take a detour miles northeast to Nui Ba Den mountain You can take a gondola followed by a hike to reach its summit cave temples then whoosh back downhill on a luge style slide Beautiful Bai Tu Long Bay is a quieter alternative to nearby Halong Bay Framalicious Shutterstock Find your own island in the sun in Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay Weâ ll concede that Halong Bay â the atmospheric sprawl of rocky coves and eroded karst islands to the east of Hanoi â is hardly off the beaten track these days But that doesnâ t mean there isnâ t more to discover away from the cruise ship crowds If a tour on a diesel powered luxury junk doesnâ t appeal consider hiring a kayak to potter around Lan Ha Bay near Cat Ba Island where outcrops sculpted by wind and waves emerge from the water like the teeth of sea monsters Alternatively leave the diesel fumes behind in calmer Bai Tu Long Bay to the north where more jungle capped islands shelter low key resorts and languorous beaches Advertisement The temples and tombs at My Son such as this former library were built between the and centuries CE Frans Sellies Getty Images Unravel Vietnamâ s complex religious history in My Son While travelers mob the regal assembly halls pagodas and historic homes of Hoi An nearby My Son offers a calmer experience of Vietnamâ s rich and layered past â particularly if you come in the afternoon The big lure here is the atmospheric collection of UNESCO listed Hindu temple ruins surrounded by jungle in a loop of the sacred Thu Bon River Sharing many architectural features with the Khmer temples of Cambodia and Thailand these crumbling red brick shrines were built between the and centuries CE by the Hindu kingdom of Champa whose descendants â the Cham people â still populate pockets of central Vietnam With only birdsong to disrupt the quiet the site scores highly for atmosphere as well as history Detour If you use Hoi An as a base for exploring My Son set aside a day to explore the nearby Cham Islands an impressive marine reserve whose granite specks are still inhabited by Cham people most now followers of Islam The best way to take in the the glories of Vietnamâ s highlands By motorbike Fabio Lamanna Shutterstock Rumble through the highlands by motorbike Vietnam largely moves on two wheels and a motorbike is by far the most enjoyable way to explore the hill country of the northwest â even if it takes some courage to adjust to the driving conditions errant livestock and steep winding roads Rent a quality bike in Hanoi then pop your wheels on the train to Lao Cai to avoid the nerve jangling ride out of the capital Once you reach the heart of the hill country you can rumble out to outlying villages far from the tourist crowds for epic views and nights in charming homestays run by members of Vietnamâ s tribal minorities Planning tip Youâ ll need an International Driving Permit to ride legally in Vietnam and this is only available for certain nationalities Many travelers manage to rent a motorbike without a permit â but if things go wrong you wonâ t be covered by your travel insurance A sleepy mountain village Bac Ha comes alive during its weekly market Supermop Shutterstock Visit villages in the â Asian Alpsâ The former French Hill station of Sapa is surrounded by mountains so impressive that French colonizers called them the â Tonkinese Alps â The surrounding villages of the Hmong and Dzao ethnic minorities have become popular destinations for hikers â and somewhat commercialized in the process For a taste of the scenic serenity that first drew travelers to these lush green hills head instead to drier calmer Bac Ha or the trails and mountain roads around Ha Giang province tucked against the border with China and seemingly sculpted by the hands of the gods Stay in hospitable homestays and explore markets peaceful stilt house villages French era relics and soaring limestone pinnacles away from the maddening crowds Planning tip While thereâ s plenty of competition for the title of best vista in Vietnam the lookouts gazing over the Dong Van Karst Plateau are strong contenders The area is designated as a UNESCO Geopark and the trip from Yen Minh to Dong Van and over the Mai Pi Leng Pass to Meo Vac is particularly spectacular Sip a perfect cup of coffee in the Central Highlands It was the French colonizers who brought coffee from the Arabian peninsula to Vietnam yet it was the farmers of the Central Highlands who mastered the art of coaxing quality beans from these undulating hills Rising to Dak Lak province provides the perfectâ terroir for growing robusta beans and the regional capital of Buon Ma Thuot is a great place to tour plantations and track down a quality cup of caphe particularly during the annual coffee festival in March If you insist on arabica beans head to Dalat and visit the community Kâ Ho Coffee cooperative to support local coffee growers from the Kâ Ho minority Planning tip The best time to visit coffee country is from September to the end of December when the harvest season is in full swing and plantations are filled with baskets of red beans In jungle clad Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park Hang Son Doong is the largest cave in the world Hanoi Photography Shutterstock Enter the worldâ s largest cave in Phong Nha Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park in north central Vietnam is a lost world of jungles and caverns including the worldâ s largest Hang Son Doong The scale of this wonder of nature is simply mind blowing a airplane could fly through the caveâ s main tunnel Parts of the limestone ceiling have collapsed bringing in natural sunlight â which means steamy Hang Son Doong contains an entire rainforest ecosystem complete with flying foxes rare langurs and even a small population of tigers Since one tour company â Oxalis Adventure â has been allowed to take a strictly limited number of visitors into Hang Son Doong on challenging four day treks The price is stratospheric itâ s true â but so is the scenery You can find a Vietnam beach for total relaxation or for more active pursuits such as kitesurfing at Mui Ne Dmitry Burlakov Shutterstock Lie out on beautiful beaches It was the beaches of Phu Quoc Island and Danang â developed as a playground for GIs during the American War â that first put Vietnam on the map for seaside vacations and both have developed into lively resort areas To find unspoiled stretches of sand modern day castaways aim their sights at the kitesurfing beaches around Mui Ne the island sands of the Con Dao archipelago and long languorous Hong Van Beach on Co To Island in Bai Tu Long Bay Planning tip The best time for a beach trip varies as you move around the country In central Vietnam skies are brightest from January to August December to April is the beach window on the south coast while northern Vietnam sees plenty of dry days from October to April See the American War through Vietnamese eyes Modern day Vietnam is moving on from conflict yet the battlefields from the American War still linger as a sobering reminder of what people had to go through to get to this point Sites of American losses such as Hamburger Hill in the Demilitarized Zone DMZ are etched into the popular consciousness â and the wartime tunnels at Cu Chi near HCMC and Vinh Moc near Hue offer a glimpse of the Vietnamese experience showing how ordinary people went to extraordinary lengths to resist the worldâ s greatest superpower Take to a boat to see the Mekong Delta in all its lush variety Tuleyhcm Shutterstock Float on the Mekong Delta Reaching out into the East Sea like an enormous hand the mighty Mekong Delta marks the end point of Southeast Asiaâ s longest river a mile monster that rises on the Tibetan plateau and empties to the south of Ho Chi Minh City This waterlogged wonderland is Vietnamâ s rice bowl nurturing a network of sleepy towns and stilt villages whose residents use the river as their primary artery for life and trade For comfortable exploring book an overnight cruise along the main channel near Can Tho or a cross border trip to Siem Reap in Cambodia For a less commercial experience take a day trip to the backwaters near Ben Tre with Mango Cruises or make your own arrangements with boat owners in Delta villages Walk with the ghosts of French Indochina in Ho Chi Minh City The former capital of South Vietnam may have changed its name from Saigon to Ho Chi Minh City HCMC but the past remains close to the surface here from the American War relics in the HCMC Museum and War Remnants Museum to the cityâ s elegant French built mansions and civic buildings many now housing museums restaurants and boutique hotels To get a feel for vintage HCMC stop for a cup of caphe sua milk coffee at the elegant Hotel Continental Saigon and sample cutting edge French cuisine at La Villa Then take a stroll past the Central Post Office Notre Dame Cathedral and the Peopleâ s Committee Building â built as Saigonâ s HÃ tel de Ville then repurposed after the Vietnamese sent the colonizers packing Planning tip To fully appreciate the marvelous lip tingling variety of HCMC street food join a foodie focused scooter tour with Saigon Street Eats Beat the heat in Hanoi by enjoying some bia hoi at a sidewalk cafe balajisrinivasan Shutterstock Embrace past and future Vietnam in historic Hanoi The vibrant capital of the former North Vietnam â and today the capital of the single nation â Hanoi is where old and new Vietnam come together Traces of the imperial past float like ghosts in a city surging skyward Hawkers drift through the narrow lanes of the Old Quarter selling snacks from traditional yoke baskets while the surrounding buildings are lit up with advertising displays and bright lights Exploring at street level is highly atmospheric and fantastic fun Mix up days visiting wartime and imperial relics with evenings feasting on some of Asiaâ s finest food and late nights dousing the sticky summer heat with glasses of bia hoi local draught beer Planning tip As they say Hanoi rocks And the best places to rock out like a local are lively live music venues such as the moody Binh Minh Jazz Club and keep it loud Hanoi Rock City Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the
