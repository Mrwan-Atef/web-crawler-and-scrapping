Jan min read Share Get from A to B faster on one of the world s best high speed train services noina Shutterstock Barreling across borders and zooming between cities high speed rail has come a long way since the first bullet train jumped across Japan in Exciting new high speed routes â generally considered those that can reach a minimum of h depending on the track type â are under construction in California Cairo and beyond Meanwhile Mexico and Chile have recently inaugurated h higher speed rail services bringing better connections to South America Thankfully swapping much loved slow scenic train trips for one of the worldâ s best high speed rail journeys doesnâ t need to mean sacrificing panoramas or experiences Instead itâ s an excellent way to maximize your vacation time indulge in modern onboard amenities or get a whirlwind window into a countryâ s landscapes â all while traveling in one of the most environmentally friendly ways The Tokaido Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka opened in and is still Japan s best bullet train blanscape Getty Images Tokaido Shinkansen Japan Route Tokyo to Osaka Best bit Savoring an ekiben bento boxes for trains against a momentary panorama of snow crowned Mt Fuji Distance miles Duration hours minutes Advertisement No high speed train journey is more lauded than Japan â s Tokaido Shinkansen Inaugurated over years ago for the Summer Olympics the worldâ s first bullet train â linking futuristic Tokyo with foodie favorite Osaka via Kyoto â remains the superstar of Japanese journeys Now rocketing up to h on the newest Nozomi trains a supplement to those included in the Japan Rail Pass this ride is about acceleration rather than appreciating scenery Still peeking at Mt Fuji if itâ s a clear day â book a right hand side seat when heading west â is indelible For the complete Shinkansen experience buy an ekiben at the sprawling subterranean Tokyo Station before boarding to enjoy rice seafood tempura and more onboard as trolley services were recently discontinued YHT Istanbul to Ankara Route Istanbul to Ankara Best bit Relishing the scenery around the Gulf of Ä zmit and Lake Sapanca Distance miles Duration hours minutes Few high speed rail journeys deliver an all round experience but s HÄ zlÄ Tren YHT linking Istanbul with the capital Ankara ticks all the boxes Sea mountain vines and lake scenes You bet Hitting maximum speeds of h Yep Onboard entertainment and complimentary snacks Book business You could even claim some continent crossing bragging rights if you take one of the direct morning departures from BakÄ rkÃ y on Istanbulâ s European side via the Marmaray Tunnel deep below the Bosphorus Strait Still connecting at SÃ Ä eÅ me Station â located on the cityâ s Asian side â is usually more straightforward Just a few hours later having glimpsed the Osmangazi Bridge across Ä zmit s Gulf spotted shimmering Lake Sapanca and zipped through tunnels youâ ll pull into Ankara the hub for s expanding high speed rail network and starting point of the unhurried epic Dogu express Catch the Frecciarossa high speed service to Venice from the impressive Milano Centrale station Viacheslav Lopatin Shutterstock Frecciarossa Milan to Venice Italy Route Milan to Venice Santa Lucia Best bit The suspense building for the grand finale crossing the Venetian lagoon and getting your first peek of the Floating City Distance miles Duration hours minutes Italy s high speed country crossing Frecciarossas Red Arrows are a winner Films are available on the own device entertainment portal onboard catering is expectedly decent and fares are fair Admittedly the Milan to Venice route doesnâ t utilize the newest trains with executive class swivel chairs Nor is it one of the fastest train routes sprinting through endless viewless tunnels â at least until a new dedicated high speed stretch opens in But itâ s impossible not to love Firstly youâ ll depart from the monumental Milano Centrale one of the worldâ s most staggering stations Secondly there are periodic panoramas occasional vineyards looming Alpine mountains and a short but sweet Lake Garda glance But itâ s that first Venice glimpse look to the left as you cross the Venetian Lagoon that takes the prize â especially as moments later youâ ll be stepping out of the station straight into the real life canvas of the Grand Canal AVE Madrid to Santiago de Compostela Spain Route Madrid to Santiago de Compostela Best bit Gawping at the vivid Galician Massif while crossing viaducts between Ourense and Santiago de Compostela Distance miles Duration hours minutes Taking the train in Spain is always a good idea Second only to China for high speed network scope Spainâ s sustainable trains â Renfe s Alta Velocidad EspaÃ ola AVE trains are powered by renewables â have myriad daily connections from Madrid to southern Spain Advertisement However my favorite darts across the more arid interior into the unapologetically green landscapes of Northwest Spain en route to Santiago de Compostela Long gone are the days when youâ d need to spend a month hiking the Camino de Santiago from Madrid traveling up to h the journey complete with cafe and wi fi flies by The last minutes are especially swoony worthy gazing out on low slung lush mountains from towering viaducts Prefer to complete your pilgrimage on foot to claim the Compostela certificate Disembark in Ourense dotted with thermal baths to tackle the one week final miles of the Camino on foot The Afrosiyob links key cities along the Silk Road in Uzbekistan Julia Drugova Shutterstock Afrosiyob Uzbekistan Route Tashkent to Bukhara and Khiva later in Best bit Sharing anecdotes with fellow travelers as you briefly barrel across the desert into Bukhara Distance miles Duration hours minutes Traversing a trio of storied ceramic clad Silk Road cities â Tashkent Samarkand and Bukhara â Uzbekistan â s Afrosiyob achieves speeds of h A far cry from the month long odysseys that camel riding traders of old would have embarked on traveling across Uzbekistan by train is now seamless comfortable and furnished with all modern features â particularly if you upgrade to spacious VIP class While the journeyâ s panoramas can become monotonous camaraderie and conversation are usually plentiful Later in the Afrosiyob should extend to further flung Khiva slashing the desert crossing time to arguably the countryâ s most enchanting but often skipped Silk Road city Fuxing sleeper train China Route Hong Kong to Beijing Best bit Settling in and scanning the brilliantly green rice fields and hills on the Guangzhou to Changsha stretch Distance miles Duration hours minutes or hours minutes by high speed sleeper Home to the worldâ s most extensive high speed rail network itâ s unsurprising that the worldâ s longest high speed train journey is China â s Guangzhou to Beijing line More impressive still is the speed Rocketing along at h in parts the route â which can be started from Hong Kong â uses state of the art Fuxing trains for both the daylight and world first high speed sleeper service which as of January only takes a couple of hours longer than the daytime counterpart Along the southern stretch the countryside views are hypnotizing Even though long journeys can get tedious the vast distance delivers assorted vistas ranging from urban sprawl to mountain backed rural villages Feel like a siesta Book yourself a lie flat business class seat Eurostar services connect England and France through a tunnel under the English Channel TungCheung Shutterstock Eurostar France and England Route London to Paris Best bit Sipping a cup of tea beneath the English Channel semi oblivious to the fact youâ re sometimes below sea level Distance miles Duration hours minutes Traveling across an international border by train is exciting But traveling under an international maritime border by train deep underwater Somewhat mind boggling Sadly for those who dreamed of riding through a giant fish bowl like underwater tube as kids the actual mile Channel Tunnel used by Eurostar and Le Shuttle a vehicle carrying train service between Folkestone and Calais is essentially a deep dark pipe Still thereâ s something extraordinary about dashing between central London and Paris point to point quicker than it would be by plane Plus with the return of Eurostar Snap in late offering random time allocated discount tickets itâ s again possible to enjoy a last minute flexible trip for less Al Boraq Morocco Route Tangier to Casablanca Best bit Daydreaming as you flit across fertile flatlands on board a double deck train Distance miles Duration hours minutes Sprinting from Tangier surveying the Strait of Gibraltar to cosmopolitan Atlantic lapped Casablanca at speeds up to h the Al Boraq train has sliced journey times between some of Morocco â s major northern cities Itâ s also a handy onward flight free travel option from Europe with ferries linking Spainâ s Tarifa with Tangier in one hour While the panoramas arenâ t particularly journal worthy the speed and comfort of the modern double deck trains â Africaâ s first high speed railway â canâ t be faulted And with multiple daily connections booking a split trip to sample a street food lunch in Rabat â s Medina or even making it to Marrakesh on a connecting train before sunset is viable Book a first class ticket and youâ ll also get lounge access inside the spacious contemporary stations complete with complimentary snacks to upgrade your experience Taiwan s only high speed train service runs from Taipei in the island s north to Kaohsiung in the south Shutterstock THSR Taipei to Kaohsiung Taiwan Route Taipei to Kaohsiung Best bit Flying through central Taiwanâ s fertile farmlands in less time than it takes to devour a biÃ ndang train bento box Distance miles Duration hour minutes Taiwan s sole but serious high speed rail line THSR springs across the islandâ s flatter west from north to south bridging Taipei â s mighty skyline with the southern city of Kaohsiung Along the way a whirlwind of verdant rice fields whizz by the window enhanced by the railway s predominantly elevated position Like Japan Taiwanâ s Shinkansens are well equipped with wi fi vending machines and even degree adjustable seats Preorder or bring a biÃ ndang tuck in and youâ ll have crossed the island before you know it ICE France and Germany Route Paris to Berlin Best bit Watching the significant shift of scenery while dining in the Bordrestaurant â pairing your meal with a French wine or German beer Distance miles Duration hours minutes Newly launched in December the Paris to Berlin InterCity Express ICE service is one of the hottest European rail tickets for Linking the French and German capitals on a largely high speed daytime route some sections use conventional railway lines the journey zooms from Paris to Strasbourg before crossing the border into Frankfurt and continuing to Berlin While itâ s not quite flight rivaling yet itâ s a welcome alternative to the sleeper service Traversing a handful of principal rivers and landscapes ranging from Alsace vineyards to dense forests itâ s a delightful day to ride the rails and read a book Shanghai Maglev China Route Shanghai Airport to Longyang Road Best bit Watching the speed rise rapidly on the digital display knowing your carriage is now levitating Distance miles Duration minutes seconds Swift record setting and revolutionary the Shanghai Maglev â which uses electromagnets to levitate above the tracks reducing friction â instantly claimed the title of the worldâ s fastest operating commercial train when it launched in Back then and until a few years ago it would regularly attain h during the brief journey Sadly for speed seekers the Maglev seldom travels above h these days adding an extra seconds to the original trip Still itâ s an incredible one time experience and a glimpse into the not so distant future of rail travel as China and Japan continue to develop and test ultra high speed maglevs paving the way for some rail journeys to one day be faster than flying Advertisement
