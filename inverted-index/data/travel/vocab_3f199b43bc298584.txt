eBooks Download instantly and read any time Explore all products Travel Stories Vietnam Share The best road trips in Vietnam Joe Bindloss James Pham Jul min read Share Vietnam is perfect for exploring on two or four wheels Â monticelllo Getty Images Long and sinuous like the mythical naga serpent Vietnam curves around the eastern shores of mainland Southeast Asia stretching all the way from China in the north to Cambodia and the Mekong Delta in the south Its twin megacities â Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City â are divided by miles of mountains jungles paddy fields beaches and historic sites In other words this is perfect country for road tripping The trip between Vietnam s northern and southern capitals is just one of many epic road trips that call out to adventurers on four or more commonly two wheels With more than million motorbikes on Vietnam s roads intrepid bikers will find themselves in good company as they explore the countryâ s wonderfully diverse landscapes with ample repair shops gas stations and food stops along the way Whether youâ re thinking of hitting the road by car or motorbike hereâ s our pick of Vietnamâ s best road trips Advertisement Drive through the glorious scenery and mountain passes of Ha Giang Â VuCongDanh Getty Images Ha Giang Loop Best road trip for wild swimming and mountain passes Ha Giangâ Ha Giang miles The soaring peaks and plunging valleys of Vietnamâ s northernmost province are best enjoyed at a leisurely pace with plenty of stop offs for revitalizing dips in waterfalls roadside snacks nothing keeps energy levels up like dried buffalo and to snap photos of the rice and corn terraces tumbling down the valleyâ s steep hillsides Start the adventure in Ha Giang city the gateway to a land of conical forested peaks plucked straight from an antique scroll painting Ha Giang means water and mountains in Vietnamese and youâ re never far from either when you tackle this loop through Yen Minh Dong Van and Bao Lam with gurgling streams and cascading waterfalls forming a major part of the scenery Winding its way through communities of at least different ethnic minorities this rewarding multi day drive offers plenty of opportunities for side trips and activities including trekking river boating and caving Planning tip The Ma Pi Leng Pass is hands down the most scenic section of the drive with jagged mountains surrounding the emerald Nho Que River Remember to factor in a half day for a quiet boat trip with a spot of swimming in its enticing waters The Ban Gioc Waterfalls make a memorable endpoint to the road trip from Cao Bang to Ban Gioc Â Peter Stuckings Shutterstock Cao Bang to Ban Gioc Best road trip through Vietnam s countryside Cao Bangâ Ban Gioc miles The drive from Cao Bang to the churning Ban Gioc Waterfall which straddles the Chinaâ Vietnam border takes adventurers through some of Northern Vietnamâ s most pristine pastoral terrain Lush farmlands stilt villages and crystal clear lakes are all on the itinerary However for driving enthusiasts nature s creations might be outdone by an artificial wonder the long miles Ma Phuc Pass with its seven writhing bends offering gorgeous views of the terraced fields below For more natural highlights consider a stop off at the vast stalactite filled Nguom Ngao Cave which extends for several kilometers underground but save plenty of time for the road tripâ s primary focus Fed by the Quay Son River the Ban Gioc Waterfalls are located partly in China and partly in Vietnam and they thunder dramatically over a series of greenery draped shelves Take in the falls from the viewing platforms or hop on a bamboo raft for a closer look at the impressive cascades which fall over Planning tip While worth tackling as a standalone trip this route is also a popular add on to the Ha Giang Loop Dalat is a former French hill station with a unique microclimate Â Khang Duong Dalat to Nha Trang Best road trip to a French colonial hill station Dalatâ Nha Trang miles Advertisement From the cool climes of the highlands around Dalat to the sunny beaches of Nha Trang this short and simple road trip is all about changing scenery and microclimates Get an early start so you have time to appreciate the hilly terrain en route and the coastal views near the end of the drive Begin in the hillsides around Dalat founded as a salubrious hill station where French colonists came to escape the oppressive heat of Saigon now Ho Chi Minh City This is a unique area of Vietnam where the scent of pine trees hangs in the air and farms cultivate strawberries coffee and flowers instead of rice As you descend from the mountains and the humidity begins to return things start to feel more conventional The paved road unfurls around hills and snakes through tiny villages all the way to the coast where a dip in the turquoise waters of Nha Trang Beach makes for a worthy close to this trip Hai Van Pass Best road trip for dramatic views and hairpin turns Danangâ Lang Co Beach miles Before the Hai Van Tunnel was completed in just the thought of enduring the hairpin turns and blind corners of the Hai Van Pass was enough to send shivers down the spines of bus passengers traveling between Danang and Hue Now with significantly less car traffic this short but stunning ride is a manageable memorable trip even for the novice driver Translating as Ocean Clouds in Vietnamese the Hai Van Pass is bordered by jungle clad mountains on one side and cliffs plunging down to the East Sea on the other a dramatic setting that has made this road one of the most Instagrammed highways in the world â with a whopping pictures per mile Detour Stop at the mid way point for a Vietnamese style iced coffee and admire the Indochina era Hai Van Gate and the remains of several French fortifications While the pass officially ends at the windswept Lang Co Beach at its northern end most travelers continue for another hour or so to reach the former imperial city of Hue to gaze at its palaces and timeless tombs A stop at the floating market in Can Tho is a highlight of a trip to the Mekong Delta Â Phuong D Nguyen Shutterstock Ho Chi Minh City to My Tho Best road trip along the lush Mekong Delta Ho Chi Minh Cityâ My Tho miles The rice paper flat Mekong Delta doesnâ t get much road trip love because its every shade of green rice fields can turn from mesmeric to slightly monotonous as the miles mount up However once you get outside of sprawling smoggy Ho Chi Minh City youâ ll see the urban shrubbery give way to majestic palms lush banana trees and glimmering waterways amongst the emerald rice paddies While the scenery here is certainly evocative the best part of driving in the Mekong Delta is taking your foot off the gas and losing yourself in the tiny riverside laneways and byways where life moves at a very different pace to the buzzing streets of HCMC When you eventually make it to My Tho â a town famed for its chewy noodle pork and shrimp soup â further cultural experiences await with the flower farms of Sa Dec a short drive to the west and Can Tho home to the largest floating market in the Delta located to the southwest Taking a motorcycle around Con Son Island is all about the sea views Â Tonkinphotography Shutterstock Con Son Island Best road trip for deserted island beaches Dam Trauâ Ben Dam miles Isolated from the mainland for years the Con Dao islands are one of Vietnamâ s natural wonders Con Son the largest and only inhabited island of the archipelago has just one main road stretching across its length â a motorcycle trip is not only the best way to see the rural splendor of the island but also to hop from one gorgeous deserted beach to the next Start at Dam Trau a long stretch of beach dotted with seafood shacks near the airport and wind your way past forested hillsides a French colonial era prison and a string of glorious beaches that only appear during low tide ending up at Ben Dam where ferries from the mainland come and go Take things slowly over a morning or afternoon and bring your swimming costume Ho Chi Minh Highway Best road trip for quintessential Vietnam experiences Ho Chi Minh Cityâ Hanoi miles There are several different routes between Vietnamâ s two biggest cities depending on whether you like beaches mountains or smooth highways but for the best balance between driving time about two weeks and excellent scenery hit the Ho Chi Minh Highway part of which was once used to transport soldiers and supplies during the Vietnam War After exiting busy Ho Chi Minh City follow the road along the Truong Son mountain range as it snakes its way past sleepy hamlets where the smell of coffee from nearby plantations hangs thick in the air This barren plateau gives way to forested mountains as you reach Central Vietnam considered the most scenic stretch of this epic road trip Detour Adventurers will want to stop at Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park home to the worldâ s largest cave and Cuc Phuong Vietnamâ s oldest national park located in the Red River Delta before joining the throng of traffic on the ancient streets of Hanoi Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local
