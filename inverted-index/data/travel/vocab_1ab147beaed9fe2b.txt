Tomales Bay California Photograph by Remy Hale By Leilani Marie Labong February Not far from the high tech hubs of San Francisco and the vineyard crowds of Napa lies a nature reserve that produces some of the country s best oysters The Tomales Bay estuary is a biodiversity hot spot and home to bivalves that feed on a constant upwelling of nutrients from the crisp cold well oxygenated waters flowing in from the Pacific Ocean For the most part good shellfish growing areas are pretty damn beautiful says John Finger co founder of Hog Island Oyster Co which has been operating on the bay s eastern shore for years Since these places are healthy enough to grow oysters that are safe enough to eat they become archetypes of a sound environment The region s oystering roots date to the Coast

an influx of Croatian fisher folk starting in the early century Now a new generation of restaurateurs and oyster farmers are reviving the bay s heritage Travelers can learn how these early settlers

meatier bivalves from the East Coast via the new Transcontinental Railway Upon arrival these new shellfish were plunged into Tomales Bay spawning a lucrative industry in one of the prettiest places in the state Back then when people in nearby San Francisco wanted fresh oysters they had to go out to places where it was clean enough to grow them says local historian and author Dewey Livingston
