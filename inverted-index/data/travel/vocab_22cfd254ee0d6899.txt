December min read The Marquesas Islands are part of French Polynesia and yet proudly apart You won t find overwater bungalows and turquoise lagoons on these volcanic islands six of which are inhabited Instead the Marquesas feature green peaks that plunge directly into the sea waterfall laced valleys and dramatic rock spires In addition to this rich natural heritage the Marquesans are active in keeping alive distinctive cultural traditions in tattooing dance language and horse riding Horses were introduced to the island of Ua Huka in the mid century a gift from French admiral Abel Dupetit Thouars who brought them from Chile Islanders tamed and adopted them over the years and they became the perfect transport for traversing roadless valleys steep slopes and high ridges Horses enabled islanders to range widely in their hunt for wild goat and pig which are traditionally slow cooked in an umu an underground oven of After a night of bivouac on the crests of Ua Huka with his sons Vohi gathers the horses in preparation for their return to the valley Photograph by Julien Girardot Along with the meat from hunting and the islands abundance of breadfruit coconut mango banana and other tropical fruits and the sea s bounty Marquesans have long had a very good living from the land says photographer Julien Girardot Nowadays with the introduction of cars and roads he says almost every Marquesan goes with a Japanese pickup to the shop to buy rice pasta and frozen chicken from the U S Yet there are still people he says who resist the islands globalization and continue a generations old horse culture In a series of photos Girardot who has lived in French Polynesia for the past seven years tells the story of three horsemen Vohi Brown of Ua Huka and Lucien Paco Pautehea and Jérémie
