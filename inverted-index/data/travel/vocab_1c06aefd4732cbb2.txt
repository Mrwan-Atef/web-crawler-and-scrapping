just a place to shop but also to banter and connect When browsing these ubiquitous markets youâ ll notice produce placed in a neat pile and priced to sell together If you attempt to buy a single tomato the vendor might hand it over free of charge Bulk buying is a quirk of Fijiâ s culture of sharing as fruits and vegetables are taken home and swapped among neighbors Gorge on papayas pineapples mangoes passionfruit coconuts lime juice watermelon and more at a fraction of the grocery store prices Planning tip Keep a look out for stands selling chilled pineapples cut into a swirl on its stem like a popsicle Itâ s the ultimate refreshing treat on a hot and humid day An underwater wonderland awaits you in Fiji Shutterstock Snorkel and scuba dive in an underwater wonderland One of the

in the treetops The rugged remote island of Kadavu also offers a birdwatcherâ s bounty â its rainforests harbor a kaleidoscopic mix of tropical birds including four found nowhere else in the world Bats are Fijiâ s only native mammal and the islands host six species After sunset you can usually spot them bolting out of caves or rustling in the treetops Fruit bats often bite into a papaya as soon as itâ s ripe and ready for harvest much to the tree ownerâ s chagrin Escape the crowds and take a chartered boat or private cruise to the stunning Lau islands Shutterstock Cruise to untamed islands

boots â there s more to Fiji than beaches EA Given Shutterstock Hike along untamed trails Though beaches often receive the brunt of tourist attention itâ s worth packing a pair of hiking shoes to see Fijiâ s wild side Islands like Taveuni Vanua Levu and Viti Levu are famed for their mountain treks and waterfalls while treks across islands in the Yasawa and Mamanuca islands offer an insight into village life Youâ ll rarely encounter a crowd on the trails â you might be thankful if you do Trails are often unmarked have little cell phone reception and can merge with livestock paths Hiring a local hiking guide to lead the way and share insight into the landscape and culture will ensure a wonderful experience Indulge in a spa treatment Leave the aftermath of a long haul flight or a day spent in the heat behind you with a traditional bobo massage A spa experience in Fiji begins with the sweet smell of coconut oil infused with plumeria petals Using a combination of kneading with the

doubt you can follow the common kava drinking customs of Fijiâ s capital city When a cup is handed to you clap before taking it with both hands Drink the liquid in one go if you can hand it back with both hands clap again and say â Bula â Feeling overwhelmed Ask for low tide and your cup will be served half full next time it comes around Most accommodations and homestay experiences offer kava
