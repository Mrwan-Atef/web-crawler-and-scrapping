Lonely Planet Editors Dec min read Share See pretty towns and dales up close as you travel through Yorkshire on a train chrisdorney Getty Images Thereâ s something magical about a journey by train Sometimes the magic is inside â mingling with other travelers dining in a restaurant car or sleeping in a private compartment as the steel wheels swish on the rails beneath you Sometimes the magic is outside in the landscape the train traverses â an adventure an experience an insight into the heart of a nation Below are some of the most beautiful train rides in Europe â some well known some less so some luxurious and expensive others true bargains From countryside views and mountain villages to alpine passes and landmark bridges the continent offers up some of the most scenic train rides in the world If this pick Europe s top ten has made you long for slow travel elsewhere check out the best experiences globally in Lonely Planet s Amazing Train Journeys Settle to Carlisle England Route Settle to Carlisle Best bit Marveling at the Ribblehead Viaduct one of the great views of northern England preferably as a steam train thunders over Distance miles Duration hour minutes Advertisement Englandâ s Settle to Carlisle line has long been synonymous with the fight to preserve beautiful and historic stretches of railway But this is no heritage line Proudly part of the British rail network and served by regular mainline trains the railway enjoys a double life as a frequent host of steam specials and even rarer steam hauled mainline services Whether you have the whiff of steam in your nostrils or the hard working growl of diesel hauled regular trains in your ears the views from the carriages are pretty much unmatched on the English railway network Passengers can feast their eyes on mile after mile of magnificent Yorkshire Dales and North Pennines scenery interrupted only by stations so pretty you would expect to find them pictured on a box of biscuits No prizes for guessing where Le Petit Train Jaune Little Yellow Train gets its name Getty Images Le Petit Train Jaune France Route Villefranche de Conflent to Latour de Carol Best bit Holding your breath as you cross the gravity defying Pont Gisclard Distance miles Duration hours minutes Since the dinky sunflower yellow carriages of the Ligne de Cerdagne have been rattling and clattering their way through the rolling forests and saw toothed mountains of the Pyrenees and they have secured a special place in the hearts of many French travelers Affectionately known as the Canary or Le Petit Train Jaune Little Yellow Train this mountain railway is frequently cited as the most scenic in France but itâ s definitely not a luxury service â itâ s a rollercoaster ride on which you will feel the wind in your hair and the chill of the mountain breeze as you ratchet your way up to the highest train station in France On y va Journey through the mountains of Montenegro all the way to its stunning Adriatic coastline Shutterstock Belgrade to Bar Railway Serbia and Montenegro Route Belgrade to Bar Best bit Levitating atop the long tall Mala Rijeka Viaduct one of the planetâ s highest railway bridges before the train glides over the Balkansâ largest lake Skadar Distance miles Duration hours Dramatic is the operative word for this route which rumbles over an unsullied mountainous landscape from Serbia s capital Belgrade to Montenegroâ s Adriatic Coast During the hour journey the train disappears into the Dinaric Alps charges through canyons teeters on stilted bridges spanning river gorges and skims atop an ancient tectonic lake Like the region it serves the railway which chugs across the heart of the Western Balkans eludes most touristsâ maps The reward for treasure hunting travelers who are informed or lucky enough to know where to dig an embarrassment of authentic culture and pristine geographic riches at every bend The Bernina Express route is especially stunning in winter Shutterstock The Bernina Express Switzerland Route Chur to Tirano Best bit Marveling at the astonishingly turquoise Lago Bianco from the routeâ s highest station Ospizio Bernina Distance miles Duration hours minutes Advertisement We can wax lyrical about the glacier capped mountains waterfall draped ravines jewel colored lakes and endless spruce forests glimpsed through panoramic windows on Switzerlandâ s Bernina Express â but trust us seeing is believing Rolling from Chur in to Tirano in northern Italy in around four hours this narrow gauge train often tops polls of the worldâ s most beautiful rail journeys It s certainly one of the most scenic train journeys in Switzerland Beyond the phenomenal Alpine landscape the railway itself is a masterpiece of early century engineering taking tunnels and bridges in its stride The line is on the UNESCO World Heritage List â and with good reason Stop at Llandeilo to explore Carreg Cennen Castle and the surrounding hills Â Chris Griffiths Getty Images The Heart of Wales Line Wales and England Route Swansea to Shrewsbury Best bit Disembarking at lonely Sugar Loaf Station for a walk or picnic around the iconic nearby knoll of the same name Distance miles Duration hours This is Swansea to Shrewsbury the slow and frankly surreal way This one carriage train traverses track through Wales and England that might easily have been consigned to a museum or an out of print book but that has somehow defied time and logic to survive as a passenger route Expect a spectrum of scenery alternating from the sand edged estuaries of South Wales via bucolic farming towns and tracts of forest and hill country you probably never knew existed through to one of Englandâ s prettiest medieval cities See the beauty of three European nations in one day on the Brenner Railway Getty Images Munich to Venice on the Brenner Railway Germany Austria and Italy Route Munich to Venice Best bit Stretching your legs at the Brenner Pass the highest point on the trip Distance miles Duration hours minutes The Brenner Railway is attractive for two key reasons mountains and wine There may be more technically astonishing high altitude trains but this was the first to cross the Alps in the On a surprisingly speedy day trip you pass through three countries â Germany Austria and Italy â and descend from the snow line to sea level Youâ re rarely far from highways but the vineyard views are still stunning Bonus great European cities with historic architecture â Munich and Venice â are at either end Wave goodbye to Inverness and travel through the Scottish countryside by train haspil Shutterstock The Kyle of Lochalsh Line Scotland Route Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh Best bit Passing under the gentle grassy slopes of Fionn Bheinn â a munro rising high over Achnasheen Distance miles Duration hours minutes Scotland has an abundance of windswept railways â the West Highland Line and the Far North Line to Thurso among them Though comparatively unsung perhaps the loneliest of all is the Kyle of Lochalsh Line â with trains rumbling doggedly from Inverness through desolate glens and past snowy munros connecting the cold shores of the North Sea to the furious whitewater of the Atlantic It is a railway line full of poetry and beloved by aficionados â but itâ s also a useful way for independent travelers to access remote nooks of the Highlands and make a journey to the Isle of Skye Have your camera ready for shots of stunning Lake Bled Shutterstock Nova Gorica to Jesenice Slovenia Route Nova Gorica to Jesenice Best bit Catching a glimpse of picture perfect Lake Bledâ s church castle and bright blue water Distance miles Duration hours Here is a near perfect railway adventure that most people have never heard of Then again you could be forgiven for missing it The Bohinj Railway after all connects two places whose significance can be lost to modern travelers Europeâ s shifting borders and politics may have rather marooned the Nova Goricaâ Jesenice line but that only adds to the appeal An unassuming regional train rattling out of a faded grandeur halt on the Italyâ Slovenia border doesnâ t even hint at whatâ s to come The journey is a spectacular tour of Sloveniaâ s upland highlights climbing through mountain towns and villages along the SoÄ a River passing through superb Alpine scenery close to Lake Bohinj and past world famous Lake Bled offering photo opportunities galore The Centovalli Express cuts through the Hundred Valleys in Switzerland Shutterstock The Centovalli Express Switzerland and Italy Route Locarno to Domodossola Best bit Taking in the Isorno viaduct the site of Switzerlandâ s first bungee jump Distance miles Duration hours Often eclipsed by Switzerlandâ s more famous rail rides this two hour trundle from Locarno on the palm rimmed shores of Lake Maggiore to Domodossola over the Italian border in Piedmont is something of an unsung beauty Brush up your Italiano to swoon in sync with fellow passengers as the dinky train clatters across bridges and burrows its way through tunnels The views make for spirit lifting stuff waterfalls shooting past cliffside views hillside vineyards gracefully arched viaducts slate roofed hamlets glacier carved ravines and mile after mile of chestnut and beech forests all set against the puckered backdrop of mountains that are snow capped in winter Bergensbanen is Norway s most scenic train journey Â stockstudioX Getty Images Bergensbanen Norway Route Oslo to Bergen Best bit Gazing over the soul stirring landscape of Hardangervidda between Geilo and Finse Distance miles Duration hours minutes This astonishing train is one of the wonders of century railway building and yet outside Norway hardly anyone knows about it In just over six hours and some miles it covers the spectrum of Norwayâ s natural splendor climbing canyons crossing rivers burrowing through mountainsides swooping past fjords and traversing barren icescapes All
