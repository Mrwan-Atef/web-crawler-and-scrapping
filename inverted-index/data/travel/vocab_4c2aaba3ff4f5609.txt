places to swim in ReykjavÃ k from luxury pools to the ice cold Atlantic Egill Bjarnason Jul min read Share Swimming in Reykjavik is a cultural activity Â Kike Arnaiz Stocksy United Every Icelandic student takes mandatory swimming lessons â for ten years This rigorous curriculum has at least one happy result pools everywhere The Capital Region â an urban sprawl of five municipalities including ReykjavÃ k â has public pools altogether All but one are outdoor thanks to cheap geothermal heat Advertisement From the Atlantic Ocean to Olympic size pools here are nine places to visit in ReykjavÃ k where swimming is only part of the pleasure Laugardalslaug Largest swimming pool Largest waterslide Largest locker rooms The Laugardalslaug pool is the most popular in ReykjavÃ k if not the country and it s within walking distance to the city center Swimming is a healthy sport but most people come for the multi temperature hot tubs Laugardalslaug a top choice for families especially when paired with one of the great ice cream stores in this part of town You won t miss the outdoor swimming pool with eight lanes and traffic rules Indoor is another pool reserved for training and competitions k Welcome to the beach of ReykjavÃ k k is where locals bring foreign friends to test their strength â swimming in an Icelandic ocean requires a bit of mettle Over summer the ocean s temperature can reach double digits like say C but overwinter a very very cold plunge is part of the program Afterward people linger in the hot tub C year round overlooking the beach The k cove is man made and the yellow sand â brought from elsewhere â is a hot commodity for sunbathing volleyball and other typical beach activities on warm summer days Changing rooms and hot tubs are admission free during the summer but cost Krona during winter The Sky Lagoon is a perennial favorite for good reason pytiiam on ig The Sky Lagoon While the Sky Lagoon is long don t attempt to swim laps This is a luxury bath with a view across the Faxa Bay and a swim up bar Advertisement The enterprise opened in at the tip of the KÃ rsnes peninsula a short drive from the city center entering the growing selection of high end bathing resorts around Iceland Sky Lagoon is the only one in ReykjavÃ k competing with the famous Blue Lagoon located some km mi from the city Admission is Krona and extra for the steam bath treatment Children under the age of are not permitted at Sky Lagoon Ã rbÃ jarlaug The suburban Ã rbÃ jarlaug is a top choice for families with shallow pools for all ages The indoor area looks like a small greenhouse delivering a warm fun atmosphere often missing in the older concrete pools Outside you ll find a leisure pool with toys and a waterslide tall enough to have an age limit The swimming pool is long with five lanes and a basketball hoop SundhÃ llin This is the best place for a city center swim Built in SundhÃ llin translates as The Swim Hall and it was designed by the legendary architect GuÃ SamÃºlsson who is better known for churches and theaters In the pool reopened after a year long revamp that added an entire outdoor area with hot tubs and another swimming pool The original indoor pool remains open as is the secret upstairs hot tub with city views Male locker rooms are original while women now dress in the new extension Over summer we recommend the outdoor locker rooms â ask staff for directions VesturbÃ jarlaug Among the three pools within walking distance from the city center together with SundhÃ llin and Laugardalslaug the VesturbÃ jarlaug has the strongest neighborhood spirit It was in fact built in with local donations and volunteer work The original swimming pool is crowded for swimming but fortunately most guests are fine doing nothing The habit of hanging out in hot water after work is strong in this neighborhood home to academics and artists Kids won t enjoy VesturbÃ jarlaug as much as other options in ReykjavÃ k Try instead the modern Sundlaug Seltjarnarness some two kilometers further into the suburbs Dalslaug Some pools are good for meeting new people others are for zoning out like Dalslaug The pool opened in in the youngest suburb in ReykjavÃ k It is so far quite big compared to the community it serves and the layout captures the Icelandic pool culture of today one modestly large swimming pool surrounded by many large multi temperature hot tubs Take your pick Take your cold plunge with a lovely hot bath afterwards at GuÃ laug Baths Â Alamy Stock Photo GuÃ laug Baths For lovers of sea swimming â and those who want to try â the GuÃ laug Baths are well worth the minute drive to the coastal town of Akranes The gorgeous baths overlook the Long Sand Beach with two hot tubs and easy access to the sea A typical visit goes cold swim hot bath cold swim hot bath Shower Ã svallalaug The Olympic size swimming pool at Ã svallalaug is where many of Iceland s best swimmers train The massive square meter indoor swim hall â with a kid s pool and a waterslide â is the largest in the country There are two hot tubs outside but the main reason to visit is the comfort or preference of being inside Etiquette at pools Do not enter a public pool with dry hair It means you are an amateur guilty of breaking the rule of showering before bathing â with soap The pools have limited chlorine and most people prefer to keep it that way You ll also want to take your towel poolside Many people leave them behind in the locker rooms but you should dry off before dripping water and wetting the floor from the pool to the locker rooms There is a dry off area by the showers with towel racks Until recently women had a dress code different from men Now going topless is allowed for everyone who wants Advertisement Advertisement
