this is a city that keeps on giving The area is easy to get around without a car and you ll find a selection of budget friendly options to help you keep enjoying your stay Here are a few ideas to get you started Savor the chance to enjoy a traditional Dublin pub In all likelihood you donâ t need us to tell you that the pub is a quintessential Dublin experience but here we are Itâ s where youâ ll meet Dubliners at their convivial easy going best and get a sense of what makes this city tick There are few Dublin institutions so fawned over and written about as the traditional pub â probably because so many of the cityâ s best known writers were regulars in them In Ulysses Leopold Bloom muses that a good puzzle would be to cross Dublin without passing a pub to which the only logical answer is that it can be done by going into every one you see Given that there are around spread about the city itâ s probably not the wisest thing to do if liver function is important to you but you can select a few that will make your Dublin stay all the more memorable One of my favorites is Mulligan s of Poolbeg Street which was also a favorite of Leopold Bloomâ s creator James Joyce The campanile inside of the Trinity College campus in Dublin trabantos Shutterstock Stroll across the cobbles of Trinity College Since its founding in Trinity College has become one of the worldâ s most famous universities It s the alma mater of Swift Wilde and Beckett and it s where you ll find the most beautiful library in the country It s also the home of the worldâ s most famous illuminated Gospel the Book of Kells The libraryâ s books have been removed as part of a landmark restoration project but the consolation prize is an enhanced digital experience that tells the story of the Book of Kells in dramatic impressive detail Trinityâ s hectares are an oasis of aesthetic elegance its cobbled quadrangles lined with handsome neoclassical buildings that lend an air of magisterial calm to the campus evident as soon as you walk through front arch Local tip If youâ re visiting during the summer â outside of term time â you can stay in student accommodation for a fraction of the cost of a hotel on the other side of the walls Embrace the joy of modern art and messy studios at the Dublin City Gallery â the Hugh Lane Hanging on the walls of a magnificent Georgian pile is the cityâ s finest collection of modern and contemporary art which runs from Impressionist masterpieces Degas Monet Manet and more to Irish artists such as Dorothy Cross and Sean Scully as well as stained glass windows by Harry Clarke The Dublin City Gallery aka the Hugh Lane after its founder also boasts the Dublin born Francis Baconâ s actual London studio the venue s most visited space brought over piece by piece and painstakingly reassembled in all its glorious mess You can t step inside but you can observe exactly how the artist lived and worked down to the minute details The entrance to Jameson Distillery AnneMarie McCarthy Lonely Planet Dive deep into Dublinâ s distilleries Did you know that Dublin was once the epicenter of the global whiskey industry While the industry went kaput throughout the century itâ s slowly making a major resurgence especially in the Liberties once known as the Golden Triangle for the number of distilleries in operation there Today there are four Teeling Distillery the first new producer in the city for years Pearse Lyons Distillery in an old church the Dublin Liberties Distillery in a year old former mill and tannery and the return of Roe Co which was once the worldâ s largest producer of whiskey inside the old Guinness Power Station On the other side of the Liffey the old Jameson Distillery is now one of the cityâ s most popular attractions while if you want to do some pretty serious tastings thereâ s the Irish Whiskey Museum near Trinity College Enjoy the exquisite Chester Beatty collection Alfred Chester Beatty was a mining magnate with exceedingly good taste and the fruit of his aesthetic sensibility is gathered in this remarkable museum Books manuscripts and scrolls were his love and his collection includes the world s second oldest biblical fragment and a collection of Qurans from the to the centuries that is considered among the best examples of illuminated Islamic texts in the world Other treasures include ancient Egyptian texts on papyrus intricately designed little medicine boxes and perhaps the finest selection of Chinese jade books on the planet Keep an eye on the calendar of events â it regularly runs qigong workshops on the rooftop garden as well as sound baths and meditation sessions Advertisement Drink a Guinness where itâ s made You didnâ t think weâ d ignore the worldâ s most famous brewery and the city s number one tourist attraction did you Guinness is more than a beer and youâ ll get a pretty good sense of how much more it is during a visit to the seven story Guinness Storehouse Along the way youâ ll learn how the beer is made with a couple of add on hands on experiences to deepen your knowledge the role of the company in Dublinâ s fortunes and how it became the global brand it is today The top floor is an atrium bar where you put the theory to the test and drink a pint just below it is an excellent spot for lunch Local tip The Guinness in the atrium bar is excellent but the best Guinness comes with atmosphere which you ll find in a traditional bar see above Kilmainham Gaol a former prison located in Kilmainham in Dublin matthi Shutterstock Visit a prison to learn about Irelandâ s struggles Irelandâ s struggle for independence was a bloody and tempestuous journey and this forbidding prison on the western edge of the city played a role in it for nearly years as the forced temporary home of many a rebel and revolutionary Unoccupied since Kilmainham Gaol is now a museum with an enthralling exhibit on the history of Irish nationalism The guided tour of its grim cells and corridors is highly memorable and it finishes in the yard where the leaders of the failed Easter Rising were executed Planning tip Book your tickets online to avoid being disappointed by sold out tours also best to book for an early morning tour as youâ ll be waiting for less time Learn the history of Dublin from Dubliners With a collection donated entirely by the general public the award winning Little Museum of Dublin on St Stephenâ s Green is a surprising blockbuster The memorabilia is quirky enough â it includes a lectern used by JFK during his visit in and the fateful letter given to the Irish delegation during the negotiations that ended Ireland â s War of Independence in and whose inherent contradictions led indirectly to the Civil War the next year â and itâ s a brilliant way of getting a potted history of the city Planning tip The museum runs great tours beyond its walls including a daily walking tour of St Stephen s Green as well as a themed weekly tour telling the story of Ireland s influential women National Museum of Ireland Decorative Arts History formerly Collins Barracks Olivier Cirendini Lonely Planet Surround yourself with culture at the National Museum of Ireland Irelandâ s most important cultural institution is the National Museum of Ireland which has four branches nationwide â three of which are in Dublin The National Museum of Ireland â Archaeology on Kildare Street is the most significant with an extraordinary collection of Celtic and early Christian gold as well as the macabre bog bodies â four Iron Age figures in various states of preservation On the other side of the Liffey just off the quays is the Decorative Arts History branch housed in beautiful century barracks On Merrion Square is the Museum of Natural History affectionately known as the Dead Zoo Eat to your heart s content at the city s lively dining scene The choice of restaurants in Dublin has never been better Every cuisine and every trend â from doughnuts on the run to kale with everything â is catered to as the city seeks to satisfy the discerning taste buds of its diners From Neapolitan style pizza at Sano to Michelin starred feasts at Chapter One youâ ll find something for every mood and budget One of the more popular trends in was for KFC â no not that kind but Korean Fried Chicken â with a bunch of authentic spots opening up all over town Planning tip It can be pretty tough to get a table at the trendiest spots in town so book well in advance â two weeks if possible but months if youâ re looking for a Michelin starred meal People enjoying outdoor dining in Howth Dawid K Photography Shutterstock Saunter around the seaside village of Howth Dublin is on the sea and some of the cityâ s loveliest neighborhoods are standalone villages such as the fishing village of Howth at the end of the DART train line to the north The village itself is gorgeous built around a busy pier and packed with restaurants serving the freshest of fresh catch but the real treat is the Howth Cliff Path Walk a mile loop that takes you over the headland for gorgeous views over the grassy slopes to the sea If you want to do a proper hike there are longer routes that lead to the Baily Lighthouse and back over rough mountainous terrain Local tip On weekends and bank holidays the Howth Market sells a huge selection of organic produce and baked goods as well as handicrafts Entrance to Marsh s Library adjacent to St Patrick s Cathedral Derick P Hudson Shutterstock Step back in time at Marshâ s Library OK so the Book of Kells Experience and the Old Library are way more famous and way more visited but that makes Marshâ s Librar y â on a side street by St Patrickâ s Cathedral all the more worthwhile The magnificently preserved scholars library founded by Archbishop Narcissus Marsh in has barely changed a jot since then Atop its ancient stairs are beautiful dark oak bookcases filled with books from the century to the early century as well as maps manuscripts including one in Latin dating from and a collection of incunabula books printed before Local tip When you walk from the first hall into the second strike up a conversation with the resident librarians They can tell you their personal theories or experiences of the resident ghost and show you the spines of the books bearing bullet holes from the Easter Rising
