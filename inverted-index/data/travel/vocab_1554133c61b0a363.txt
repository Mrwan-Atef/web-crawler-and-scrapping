floating restaurant to finding your favorite view of the Eiffel Tower here are the best things to do in Paris Neirfy Shutterstock Rooksana Hossenally is one of the authors of the Lonely Planet Paris guidebook Here she shares her suggestions for the best and most unique activities to do in Paris Paris has retained its spot as a leading city destination in the world and itâ s not hard to see why Being a Paris local I may be biased but the French capital really does have it all from centuries old architecture and fascinating history to dynamic food and art and a multicultural population pushing the boundaries of creativity What really draws crowds however are the things you can only do in Paris From Michelin star dining on the River Seine to flea market shopping on the outskirts of the city here are some of the top things to do on your next visit to Paris The restaurant on board the Ducasse sur Seine is named after the three Michein star chef Alain Ducasse Wirestock Creators Shutterstock Have dinner on the Seine imagined by Michelin star chefs The range of dinner cruises on the Seine is overwhelming and it can be hard to choose between them If you want to splash out failsafe options include the floating restaurants led by the three Michelin star chefs FrÃ dÃ ric Anton and Alain Ducasse Advertisement For a more intimate experience go for the Don Juan II overseen by FrÃ dÃ ric Anton Belonging to the Yachts de Paris the restaurant only has a handful of tables but has itself earned a Michelin star under Anton s leadership Inside mahogany paneling thick carpets and opulent Pierre Frey fabrics give the space a homely feel The boat leaves at sundown and guests get to gaze out at Parisâ most magical highlights from Notre Dame Cathedral to the Eiffel Tower lit by hundreds of little lights as they tuck into a five course seasonal menu with highlights such as creamy stracciatella with lashings of caviar and fleshy langoustine The other livelier option is a table on board the shiny steel and glass Ducasse sur Seine which takes the same route and serves four to six course menus designed in conjunction with Alain Ducasse You can go up on deck on both boats which is the best spot for watching the Eiffel Tower dazzle on the hour Planning tip Do make reservations as far in advance as possible as both dinner cruises tend to get booked up The ports can be tricky to find especially when youâ re not familiar with the quays so allow for plenty of time to arrive because the cruises won t wait Enjoy a picnic with a view of Notre Dame Notre Dame Cathedral is rightfully a major highlight in all the guidebooks but it has become a victim of overtourism The interiors are beautiful but if you don t want to queue up to visit you can see it from a different perspective instead Pack a picnic â perhaps a baguette salted butter ham and cheeses â and set up on the small stretch of the Seine riverbank west of the Port de Montebello From here you can see the cathedralâ s wooden lattice structure known as the â forestâ because it was made using oak trees Before the roof was destroyed in the fire it was one of the oldest frameworks in Paris The statues of the Apostles and Evangelists which were staggered on the roof of the cathedral eerily looking down from above were spared from the fire and are now back Planning tip As with any outdoor activity make sure to check the weather conditions before you put together your picnic and set off Fresh pastries at Boulangerie Utopie in Paris Peter Yeung for Lonely Planet Renew your appreciation for croissants Croissants might be an everyday staple in France but the painstaking work that goes into making the buttery viennoiseries sweet baked goods is sometimes taken for granted However after taking a croissant making class at the Seine side La Cuisine Paris cooking school I learned that it takes several days to make croissants They have no less than layers of pastry and butter that are lovingly kneaded delicately rolled together and plaited before they can go in the oven That was just one of many interesting facts we learned from taking the class making it a novel way of getting to know about French food and culture Planning tip Book in advance as the classes are very popular La Cuisine also does gift vouchers which could make good presents for friends and family traveling to Paris in the near future Dive into Parisâ contemporary art scene with your own guide Swap Parisâ overcrowded museums for some gallery hopping across the city from the chic Marais to bohemian Belleville Itâ s here that youâ ll catch much of the art sceneâ s latest emerging talent and you wonâ t need to queue â in fact youâ ll often get the chance to be alone in a room to take in the works If youâ re lucky you might even get to meet the artists as they stop by to check in on their show Advertisement If you donâ t know where to start get in touch with Paris art guide Alexandra Weinress who will take you on a tailor made tour in English or French based on your interests She can also include fun pit stops like a lunch at one of her favorite modern brasseries Explore a mass grave below ground First and foremost a word of warning that this isnâ t for the fainthearted But head below ground and you ll enter the maze of galleries that make up the Catacombs of Paris containing the remains of several million Parisians During the century the rise in public health risks linked to the cityâ s cemeteries led to bones and skulls being exhumed and transferred here arranged several meters high along the walls in underground galleries Today you can listen to an audio guide of the giant tomb which brings to light yet another fascinating and offbeat part of Parisian history Planning tip Be warned that the Catacombs are accessible via stairs only including on the way out which may not be suitable for some visitors View of famous Louvre Museum from the Seine River Kiev Victor Shutterstock Visit the largest museum on Earth If you guessed the MuseÃ du Louvre then you guessed right Yes it may be firmly on the well beaten tourist track but itâ s there for good reason one being its size Once the royal palace that housed none other than Napoleon the Louvre has borne witness to centuries of history since it was founded in The largest museum in the world it has almost sq meters sq ft of exhibition space rooms and miles of corridors where artworks out of nearly held by the museum are showcased The works span several thousand years and continents from the Americas to Asia with the Egyptian wing being a favorite Head spinning facts aside for visitors who arenâ t fans of the museum experience itâ s also possible to get a sense of the Louvreâ s size importance and beauty by walking the full length of its exterior from the rue de Rivoli to its interior courtyards which are accessible for free throughout the day Planning tip The museum is open until on Wednesdays and Fridays when it tends to be less crowded Like many museums in Paris the Louvre is closed on Tuesdays Check the latest timings on the Louvre website beforehand as they can vary from season to season Bohemian Montmartre was once the stomping ground of Pablo Picasso Ludique KavalenkavaVolha Getty Images Travel back in time to bohemian Montmartre Montmartre is a village with bohemian artistic roots Perched on the highest hill of Paris it s crowned by the gleaming white SacrÃ Coeur Basilica which opened in One of the last villages to join the arrondissements of Paris proper it has retained its village atmosphere with narrow lanes that wind down the hillsides lined with stone houses cafes restaurants and boutiques This was once a stomping ground for artists including Pablo Picasso who would hole up at Le Bateau Lavoir â an artistsâ residency that to this day seldom opens its doors to visitors â and party at the numerous nightlife spots The village was scattered with windmills that once ground flour and crushed grapes giving rise to debauched nights in the areaâ s cabarets and guinguettes popular outdoor taverns where there is dancing Some of these have survived like Chez Michou and Le Lapin Agile Today there is only one functioning windmill left the Blute Fin windmill which is not accessible to the public The Radet windmill you see as part of the Moulin de la Galette restaurant on rue Lepic once stood next to the Blute Fin and was moved here in the The Clos Montmartre vineyard still exists and there is an annual grape harvest festival in October which is worth coming to the city for Planning tip The best way to see Montmartre is by taking one of our itineraries in the latest Lonely Planet Paris guidebook Alternatively take the Promotrain or Montmartrain which carry visitors around Montmartre to the main sites Itâ s about an hour round trip and they re especially good for people with restricted mobility families with young children and visitors short on time Soak up the magic of the Latin Quarter at sundown The Latin Quarter is one of Parisâ oldest districts with some parts dating back to Roman and Medieval times Some vestiges from the Roman period are still visible to this day like the ArÃ nes de LutÃ ce a former amphitheater and the baths inside the Cluny Museum and from the Middle Ages too such as the Church of Saint SÃ verin as well as La Sorbonne university founded in While the Latin Quarter is one of the most atmospheric areas of the city itâ s also one of the busiest A way around that is to visit at sundown when most visitors go back to their accommodations One of the highlights of Paris in general is strolling at nightfall because the buildings are lit up in such a way that it brings out lots of small details you might miss in the daytime The Latin Quarter is no exception Stop at the Bombardier pub for a drink on the terrace right across from the regal PanthÃ on where some of the countryâ s greatest thinkers have been laid to rest including Simone Veil and Victor Hugo Get under the surface of Franceâ s food scene France s food scene is a major draw for visitors and in Paris there are over fresh produce markets hundreds of delis and bakeries and thousands of restaurants and cafes to try To really understand the localsâ love of food the history behind its national importance and to taste some local favorites too book a tour with a guide Food guide Neil Kreeger neil kreeger gmail com puts together bespoke itineraries based on your preferences and unpacks the mysteries behind every major French classic from macarons and croque monsieur to the numerous cheeses and wines as well as the more recent food trends Experiences last about three hours in one neighborhood Notable figures including the composer Chopin are interred at PÃ re Lachaise Cemetery Bruno De Hogues Getty Images Ponder the lives of luminaries departed A great way of seeing another side of Paris is through some of its beautiful cemeteries The most famous is PÃ re Lachaise in the arrondissement which spans hectares acres and contains no less than burial plots Created in itâ s halfway between a leafy park and a huge shrine where the style of the graves ranges from Gothic mini chapels to impressive Haussmannian burial chambers and great big mausoleums for whole families Some of the cemeteryâ s most famous â residentsâ include Oscar Wilde MoliÃ re Edith Piaf FrÃ dÃ ric Chopin and Jim Morrison whose graves are popular tourist spots for visitors from all over the world â three million a year descend on the cemetery to be exact Find your favorite view of the Eiffel Tower Of course itâ s obvious that Paris is the only place you can see the Eiffel Tower But whereâ s the best vantage point Thatâ s the million dollar question that could keep locals debating all night long Catching glimpses of the Grande Dame from all over the city is half the fun For visitors who want the real full size unobstructed view then the Trocadero is the number one spot For a degree view from the skies then the Montparnasse Tower rooftop observation deck has to be it And for more fleeting glimpses catch the metro line between the stops of Passy and Bir Hakeim Otherwise there are several rooftop restaurants and bars where you can dine while gazing at Parisâ most popular monument like at Le Printemps and Galeries Lafayette department stores and many five star hotel rooftop restaurants like the Peninsulaâ s Lâ Oiseau Blanc the Cheval Blancâ s Tout Paris or Le Jardin or the Shangri La â s champagne garden in summer The Palais Garnier can seat people posztos Shutterstock Resurrect the Phantom of the Opera You can book to see a show at the Palais Garnier Parisâ world famous opera house Built in it was named after Charles Garnier its architect Itâ s an Italian style auditorium known for its celestial ceiling fresco by artist Marc Chagall and can hold up to visitors in one sitting Possibly the most famous opera house in the world it was immortalized in the novel The Phantom of the Opera keeping the legend of terrifying ghostly happenings alive Itâ s possible to visit the incredibly opulent opera house with its heavily gilded interiors and grand marble staircases You ll walk the maze like corridors of dressing rooms and rehearsal spaces behind and under the stage and even see the underground lake that flows below the opera house Planning tip There are a number of ways to visit the opera house including self guided visits guided tours through an immersive game based on the story of the fictional thief and master of disguise ArsÃ ne Lupin and via games for children Find a unique souvenir or simply watch the world go by at the St Ouen flea market Shutterstock Lose yourself in the worldâ s biggest flea market While it is true that most of Paris blockbuster sights are found within the city center itâ s worth venturing a little further afield to visit St Ouen flea market the Puces de St Ouen One of the biggest markets in the world itâ s actually made up of markets selling all sorts of wares from antique jewelry to furniture clothing and records Hidden in the markets are also restaurants and cafes that make great pit stops to sit and watch life go by Start on rue des Rosiers in St Ouen which isnâ t in Paris proper and wander through the markets that sprawl out on either side in warehouse spaces You could easily spend a whole day exploring Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real France Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers Everywhere
