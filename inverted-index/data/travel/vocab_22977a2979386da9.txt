this mountain region dealing with overtourism and environmental decline The Stok Palace Heritage Hotel in Ladakh India is still home to the royal Namgyal family who rent out three suites to visitors The year old residence is one of several accommodations in this popular northern India region which share Ladakhi culture and arts with travelers Photograph by HH Jigmed Namgyal By Charukesi Ramadurai August min read Hotelier Rigzin Namgyal fondly remembers a time when only the truly curious and adventurous made their way to Ladakh When this region in north India opened to tourists in the mid just a few backpackers each year undertook the long and arduous journey by road over dangerous mountain passes from Manali in the neighboring state of Himachal Pradesh They were invested in learning about our history and culture our flora and fauna says Namgyal They were ready to get out of their comfort zone and stay in local homes for that experience But after a Bollywood blockbuster shone a spotlight on this region s stunning landscapes and several airlines launched short haul from New Delhi Ladakh has been overrun by tourists Almost overnight guesthouses and tour operators sprung up haphazardly without proper planning or regulation taking a toll on the fragile high altitude desert ecosystem Leh Palace built in has stunning views over the city of Leh Cradled by mountain peaks the capital of the state of Ladakh sits at feet making it one of the highest altitude towns in the world Photograph by BRENDAN HOFFMAN Nat Geo Image Collection Cradled by the Karakoram and Himalaya mountain ranges this once remote Shangri la with its high mountain passes turquoise lakes and Mahayana Buddhist monasteries has become an Instagram able weekend getaway Thousands of Buddhist temples filled this sacred skyline Now we have more tourists but they are not interested in what Ladakh has to offer in terms of culture or adventure They just want to take photos at Pangong Lake or ride a camel at Nubra Valley and go home without really seeing anything says Rigzin Kalon who has built a boutique hotel on his ancestral land in Nubra Snow leopard conservationist Behzad Larry says that Ladakh has gone from being a land with subsistence farming zero plastic and dry compost toilets to being an ecological nightmare With noxious fumes from clogged landfills depleted groundwater levels and unprecedented flash floods the damage to local ecosystems far outweighs any economic benefit to local communities But even in the midst of the building frenzy that is producing newer and larger hotels every season there is hope in the form of ecolodges and boutique hotels set up and run by people committed to conservation and community This has meant a return to traditional architecture built using the rammed earth technique and with locally available stone and wood known to keep homes insulated in winter unlike the modern cement and concrete structures In Stok Palace Heritage Hotel the Royal Suite is colorfully decorated and houses family heirlooms of the aristocratic Namgyal family Photograph by HH Jigmed Namgyal The dining room at Stok Palace offers traditional Ladakhi dishes including momo dumplings and thukpa soup Photograph by HH Jigmed Namgyal These activists aim to preserve a dying way of life and direct tourist attention away from the obvious attractions freeing them up from congestion There is also a focus on imparting livelihood skills to young people to halt the migration from small villages to already overcrowded cities like Leh or Delhi Kalon says that the training programs are often tailored for women since compared to other parts of India Ladakhi women have more say within the family and are the primary decision makers So if I can help the women then the money they earn is going in the right direction towards education and development Where to stay Stok Palace The royal Namgyal family is still in residence within their year old palace with a part of it converted into a boutique hotel with just a few rooms With its carefully preserved wall murals and thoughtfully curated family heirlooms Stok Palace is an excellent specimen of vernacular architecture built entirely by local craftsmen Apart from sponsoring the education of village kids the family also supports and showcases traditional craft and culture in the form of art music and dance and weaving Lchang Nang Translated as house of trees this almost entirely solar powered homestay is set inside an orchard in a small village in Nubra Valley Owner Rigzin Kalon says their aim is

Valley is the latest boutique property from Ladakh Sarai Building on the idea of fewer rooms and a better experience owner Rigzin Namgyal has spread his camps across Ladakh from mud chalets just
