Where to eat the best barbecue in Kansas City TRAVEL A culinary tour of Kansas City the Midwestern city where food is ruled by flame Brisket burnt ends and an anything goes spirit define barbecue culture in KC a Midwestern US city with a voracious appetite for all things smoked charred and flame grilled City Market first opened in and now sells a variety of produce baked goods crafts and jewellery Photograph by Matt Gush Alamy Stock Photo By James March November This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK In the space of minutes what was a small scattering of people outside Chef J BBQ has become a sizeable queue Under an azure dome of Midwest sky the November air is crisp in Kansas City s West Bottoms neighbourhood as midday approaches There s no obvious restaurant signage here save for a faded palette leaning against a wall with white painted lettering on each scratched plank advertising beef brisket turkey pork ribs burnt ends The doors open and we re beckoned up the creaking wooden stairs of Chef J s old redbrick townhouse Inside a large chalkboard hanging above a counter flanked by pillars of corrugated iron advertises an array of cuts sandwiches and sides a intense whiff of smoke and meat emanates from the kitchen behind I m a rough around the edges kinda guy says owner and pitmaster Justin J Easterwood looking proudly around the restaurant he opened in I don t like new and shiny stuff Wearing a dull green sweater with brown hair tied back into a ponytail and red tattoos dancing up his right arm Justin has been a devotee of the flame since his teens Now years later a monstrous gallon smoker sits outside his restaurant like a submarine in a dry dock burning all night long He cooks as many slabs of fresh brisket as possible for the next day and once it s gone it s gone There s something to be said about cooking over fire Justin tells me You have to adjust to what it s doing it s not just a question of turning on a burner or setting the oven to high That fire dictates what s going on flavour wise You gotta respect the fire It really is like a living breathing thing And from those crackling embers Justin presents me with a slice of fatty brisket caramelised ribs with a sweet glaze and some delicate pork belly burnt ends Burnt ends a Kansas City barbecue staple are usually taken from beef brisket but Justin prefers pork They re soft sweet and with a light kick from the peppery rub Biting into the brisket any toughness soon falls away into a buttery salted nirvana Classic Kansas barbecue dishes such as the caramelised rum glazed pork rib can be found all over Kansas City Photograph by StockFood News Life Media Justin tends to eschew the thick sticky molasses heavy sauces that Kansas City barbecue is also known for preferring to let the meat s natural flavours shine through But this is a city that s always played a little fast and loose with the rules Straddling the state line between Missouri and Kansas the city they call KC sits right in the heart of America s Midwest in the century it was a vital trading post and crossroads on the Missouri River When prohibition arrived in the Kansas City developed a lawless reputation under mob boss Tom Pendergast and its speakeasies attracted celebrities politicians misfits and musicians all looking to get their kicks away from the prying eyes of the law Much of this activity took place at the smoke filled jazz clubs and drinking dens along and Vine a largely African American neighbourhood where Henry Perry a few years earlier had begun barbecuing in an outdoor pit by an old streetcar barn Serving diced cuts of smoked meat wrapped in newspaper Henry s style of cooking caught on and eventually led to the opening of the iconic Arthur Bryant s Barbecue on the same spot in whose guests have since included the likes of Jack Nicholson and Barack Obama Almost a century after the so called father of Kansas City barbecue began serving smoked meats there are more than barbecue restaurants scattered across KC It s likely that the freewheeling nature of the city s past allowed it to be more laissez faire with its definition of barbecue too To put it simply these days pretty much anything goes Smokehouses across Texas traditionally fire up beef briskets that are light on sauces or marinades while over in the Carolinas you ll find pork shoulder pulled pork and whole hogs coated in thinner vinegar marinades or spicy mustard sauces But in Kansas everything is on the table and everyone is invited to the party Especially newcomers Opened in in Midtown s exposed brick walls host sepia photos newspaper clippings sauce jars for sale and trophies won by its late founder and local barbecue legend Rob Magee TVs line the space above the bar though few customers pay attention to them instead metronomically lifting their heads between food and conversation I d led kitchens I d opened hotels but I d never run a barbecue restaurant before says executive chef Philip Thompson about his journey to as we sit at a table near the bar Housemade charcuterie with pickles and Filipino jam at the Fox and Pearl a snug Westside spot serving fine Midwestern food by chef Vaughn Good Photograph by Pilsen Photo Co Op For a cuisine so quintessentially American it s a surreal experience to be talking with a fellow Brit as he explains in a mid Atlantic drawl how he became a barbecue convert Wide eyed and raising his hands for emphasis when speaking Philip tells me he s lived in the US for almost years and displays a student like reverence for the world he s adopted Burnt ends is what KC barbecue is all about he says slicing off a crispy end of brisket during a meandering tour through s warren of kitchen corridors where huge smokers burn hickory wood for up to hours at a time I chew slowly to savour every last second of this heavenly square where the charred end contrasts deliriously well with the succulent pink interior and I can see why Philip playfully refers to them as meat marshmallows Amazingly such was the disdain with which burnt ends were treated during barbecue s infancy they were once handed out for free at counters while orders were taken At the time they were called burnt edges Philip explains After a while the chefs realised that this part of the brisket has a really nice marbling of fat so they d separate that from the brisket dice it into cubes and call it burnt ends Back at the table I m treated to some tender pork belly a thicker juicier cut of brisket and some magnificent chicken wings tossed in chipotle barbecue sauce and grilled for extra caramelisation I m being bludgeoned by barbecue in its most naked form but this town especially in old school joints like Gates BBQ and Arthur Bryant s also loves throwing its finest cuts into overflowing sauce laden sandwiches A minute drive from here deeper into KC s suburban sprawl is a place serving arguably the city s most unusual barbecue in bread In its car park the glare of the bright Midwest sun makes it hard to read any of the vehicles number plates so I need to squint a little but my eyes don t deceive me there are several California and Louisiana plates alongside the usual flurry of pale blue Kansas ones Central California is around a mile drive so the sloping parking lot at Joe s Kansas City BBQ is the first indication of the sort of dedicated pilgrims the place attracts Kansas City restaurant Fox and Pearl champions local produce and seasonally changing menus Photograph by Pilsen Photo Co Op Back in Anthony Bourdain the late chef and TV presenter brought national attention to this mint green intersection joint which doubles as a petrol station Oh he changed our whole business Put us on the map as a destination a place to go says Joe s director of marketing Eric Tadda as we take a seat near a window and watch hulking SUVs rumble by on the nearby highway while a lonesome country music song rings out of the mounted speakers above There s a certain novelty appeal that comes with the convergence of a gas station and Bourdain s seal of approval but this isn t the only reason folks from out of state visit The Z Man sandwich is another I tell Eric I m not leaving without trying the legendary sandwich named after local radio DJ Mike Zerek the Z Man who visited relentlessly always asking for a brisket sandwich topped with melted cheese and two onion rings He just kept ordering it explains Eric So they had a competition to name the sandwich and nothing stuck more than Z Man It just became a hit The Z Man is smaller than I expect but after the first bite I can see why they sell over a day The onion rings blend perfectly with the thinner cuts of smoky brisket sliced especially for this while the texture is gloriously softened by melted cheese inside a buttered and toasted kaiser roll Not only is this the best thing I ve eaten in KC the grab and go sandwich is also one of the best entry level items for anyone interested in exploring barbecue culture In this laid back anything goes barbecue town there really is only one rule arrive with a voracious appetite
