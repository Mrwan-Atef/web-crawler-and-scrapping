eroded over millions of years to form strange fantastical shapes These include cracked egg formations which look exactly as the name suggests Visitors need only walk minutes from the designated car parks to feel a true sense of adventure and solitude here Ranger and field producer Stan Allison has worked at Bisti since and is passionate about protecting its character It s important to have
