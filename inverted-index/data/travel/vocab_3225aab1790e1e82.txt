instruction there are no particular rules for visiting a Buddhist temple other than taking your shoes off when climbing the stairs to the main hall Note that indoor photography is generally prohibited Visitors to shrines traditionally follow a basic procedure although it is not a requirement First at the stone chÅ zuya basin rinse both hands and use the hishaku bamboo ladle to pour water into a cupped hand to rinse your mouth spit it out onto the gravel and not in the basin Next head to the haiden worshippersâ hall in front of the main hall where you can toss a coin into the offering box and then shake the rope that hangs below a bell to â wake the gods â Bow twice loudly clap twice and bow twice more once deeply then lightly before stepping back and to the side The best time to visit

light ups and other seasonal events The best time to visit will almost always be early in the morning or earlier in the day before the crowds of worshippers and visitors arrive Transportation options
