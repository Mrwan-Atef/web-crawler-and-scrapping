Rediscovering khachapuri Georgia s must try classic Al fresco dining at Leila in Old Tbilisi Photograph by Nino Megrelidze TRAVEL Rediscovering khachapuri Georgia s must try classic Khachapuri cheese filled bread is a staple that comes in dozens of forms Regional varieties are now celebrated again with chefs looking to the past to help shape the country s culinary future By Jennifer Hattam Photographs by Nino Megrelidze January min read This article was created by National Geographic Traveller UK Everyone will tell you their granny made the best khachapuri in the world Maka Shengelia says breaking up the bright orange egg yolk with her fork and stirring it into the bed of soft white cheese beneath She dabs butter onto the crunchy crust of the boat shaped dough that cradles the gooey mixture and we dig in In Georgia khachapuri is enjoyed at every type of occasion and any time of day whether for breakfast as a quick snack or as part of a lavish dinner feast known as a supra Maka a culinary guide in Tbilisi has brought me to Retro one of the capital s many sakhachapures khachapuri cafes for a taste of the house speciality Adjarian khachapuri named after the Black Sea coastal region from which it and Retro s owner hails This is a classic sakhachapure with a simple decor of bare walls and wooden picnic tables plus traditional Georgian fizzy drinks on tap Maka orders chocolate flavour a childhood favourite while I choose an electric green tarragon lemonade whose fizzy sweetness and liquorice notes cut through the rich salty cheesiness of the khachapuri We eat with our hands tearing off chunks of the chewy bread to scoop up the filling with I ve come to Tbilisi to learn more about khachapuri and with each meal I have it becomes clear I d need much longer than a few days to try every version of this classic comfort food The common refrain is that there are as many recipes for khachapuri as there are kitchens in Georgia and almost distinct varieties have been identified Some are round others square They can be open or closed flaky or soft cooked on the stove or in an oven stuffed with everything from meat to wild greens mashed potatoes and caramelised onions One thing though is non negotiable Oven baked Imeretian khachapuri at Gunda Photograph by Nino Megrelidze Adjarian khachapuri at Gunda restaurant Photograph by Nino Megrelidze If it doesn t have cheese it s not khachapuri says Esma Kunchulia A TV chef and founder of Pirveli Georgia s first culinary magazine Esma has invited me to her home on the outskirts of Tbilisi where she hosts dinners and cookery classes that celebrate and spread the word about her country s cuisine Today the table is covered with a spread of Georgian classics There s a bowl of satsivi chicken in a creamy walnut sauce A plate of nigvziani badrijani thinly sliced and fried aubergine rolls stuffed with a garlicky walnut and herb paste A salad of tomatoes onions and cucumbers Smoky salty sulguni a brined cheese on a bed of ghomi a cornmeal porridge And of course there s khachapuri two types each from a different region one Svanetian style pillowy dough stuffed with a mix of soft cheese and green onions and one flaky crescent shaped Gurian variety filled with cheese and hard boiled eggs Khachapuri s name Esma tells me comes from the Georgian words for cheese curds and bread khacho and puri respectively Different varieties are associated with different regions of the country Svanetian originates in Svaneti in the north west while Gurian comes from the Guria region north of Adjara Georgian food Esma adds is a mix of Asia and Europe our style of cooking comes from both our guests and our enemies In both categories the list of culinary contributors is long Georgia s history dates back to the ancient kingdom of Colchis the home of the Golden Fleece in Greek mythology with periods under Roman Mongol Persian Ottoman and Russian occupation or rule This blend of influences is evident on the streets of Tbilisi which spreads along the banks of the Mtkvari River overlooked by a fourth century fortress As I explore the city I discover the architecture on Rustaveli Avenue the main thoroughfare ranges from imposing Soviet era buildings to baroque and neo Moorish edifices while the nearby old town is a place of alleyways and cobbled streets overhung by intricately carved wooden balconies There are several bathhouses in this area too with domed roofs and lavish Persian tiles while the nearby Bridge of Peace a modern glass and steel construction was a controversial addition to the cityscape when it was erected a decade ago The historic Abanotubani district known for its sulphur baths Photograph by Nino Megrelidze The story of khachapuri I head a few miles north of the old town across the river to Tbilisi s Dezerter Bazaar to explore the source of many restaurant larders All the cornerstones of Georgian cuisine are laid out at this open air market where vendors hawk baskets heaped with walnuts and dried fenugreek buckets of vividly coloured pickled vegetables and stacks of churchkhela a candle shaped sweet made from walnuts encased in grape must alongside plastic bottles full of both homemade sauces and chacha the fiery local grape spirit I walk past a line of men selling potatoes out of the back of vans and my nostrils fill with an intense citrussy scent Around the corner I find tables laden with piles of coriander The fragrant herb is such a key part of the nation s cuisine that the Georgian politician author and academic Levan Berdzenishvili once dubbed his compatriots Homo corianderous It can be found in everything from lobio a bean stew to the vegetable pâté pkhali while in dried seed form it s one of the bases for khmeli suneli a traditional spice mix The bazaar may be well stocked but the war in Ukraine has had an impact on both Georgia and khachapuri restricting crucial supplies of wheat from Russia among other things The ISET Policy Institute at Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University compiles the monthly Khachapuri index which tracks inflation based on the cost of the ingredients of Imeretian khachapuri the most common variety from the region west of Tbilisi specifically flour cheese butter milk eggs and yeast Right now the index is showing an upward trend But khachapuri is resilient and adaptable a constant through often troubled times People I speak to in Tbilisi recall how during the period of scarcity following independence from the Soviet Union in their mothers would make the dish using oil instead of butter and just a smattering of cheese Others who didn t have money to buy cheese were mixing chopped pasta with salt and stuffing that inside khachapuri according to Ia Katsia an economist at the ISET Policy Institute Meanwhile migration from rural to urban areas gave rise to the now common city style khachapuri made with yoghurt and bicarbonate of soda instead of yeast which takes longer to rise Every khachapuri in every region has its own story says Dalila Tsatava president of the Georgian Gastronomy Association when we meet at Leila a city centre cafe with a mostly vegetarian menu In the northern highlands of Racha for example the square flaky local version of the bread is baked with a walnut in each corner as a talisman for a good walnut harvest During the year Soviet period Dalila says state run restaurants all served a standard selection of dishes and while Imeretian khachapuri made the cut many of the regional varieties and customs surrounding the eating of the dish which has traditionally been served at festivals risked being lost Whenever a dish is part of a ritual you know it s authentic Dalila says as I nibble on spinach pkhali and pickled jonjoli the buds of the Colchis bladdernut tree But a lot of this history isn t written down so even Georgians themselves sometimes don t know what treasure they have in terms of gastronomy That she adds is how you end up with misnomers like cheese boat or Georgian pizza the latter a term she particularly bristles at telling me khachapuri existed long before pizza Khachapuri at Gunda Photograph by Nino Megrelidze Old and new While the full history of the dish remains murky Dalila cites mentions by Greek writers in the fifth century BC of a khachapuri like dish being made in the Colchis territory The word khachapuri however didn t appear in writing until Perhaps because of its long history and how close many regional variations have come to being lost khachapuri doesn t tend to be something many Georgians are willing to tinker with But that s not to say there s no room for innovation within the country s gastronomy as a whole A few blocks south of Dezerter Bazaar Barbarestan appears at first glance to be a traditional restaurant embroidered table runners vintage style chandeliers flower patterned china But in recent years the family run spot has been putting a new spin on Georgian cuisine I sit down with general manager Andria Kurasbediani and he explains how after years of serving standard Georgian dishes his family reimagined and renamed their restaurant in taking inspiration from the first ever Georgian cookbook The Complete Cuisine In the century Duchess Barbare Jordjadze compiled the historic recipe volume by travelling around the country and Barbarestan s menu refelcts this featuring twists on many regional specialities Racha style lobio traditionally a kidney bean stew with smoked ham becomes an explosion of flavour inside bite size fried balls of dough the creamy bean filling seasoned with fenugreek garlic and coriander The Meskhetian noodle and yoghurt soup tutmaji meanwhile is prepared with homemade pasta stacked in a shape resembling the southwestern region s traditional nested domes Beyond Barbarestan many more Georgian chefs and restaurateurs are turning to traditional recipes techniques and produce for inspiration At Gunda a bright modern Tbilisi sakhachapure owners Levan Qoqiashvili and Lali Papashvili seek out regional cheeses for their khachapuri These include the soft strongly flavoured narchvi which is traditionally aged for up to a year in wooden boxes in the villages of Svaneti Churchkhela and dry fruits at Dezerter Bazaar Photograph by Nino Megrelidze Barbarestan s executive chef Barbare Gogitidze cooks with dambal khacho a traditional Georgian cheese Photograph by Nino Megrelidze In Gunda s open kitchen Levan slips a piece of paper under the dough that a chef is rolling out to make puff pastry style Meskhetian khachapuri He tells me it s a trick he learned from an old woman in a village in the region The dough isn t thin enough until you can read the writing on the paper through it he says This one is just the right thickness so the chef folds it in thirds adds more butter never too much for this dough says Levan before folding it again in the opposite direction to make a square cheese filled parcel that s ready to bake in the wood fired oven Unlike with pizza a closed oven is needed to keep the steam inside while cooking Levan explains He and Lali were so committed to doing things right they even rebuilt the restaurant s outer wall to make room for a specially made village style oven Before opening Gunda in Levan and Lali worked with a team of researchers who combed all corners of Georgia to uncover as much as they could about khachapuri and its key ingredients They documented regional varieties collectively using more than types of traditional cheese and five endemic families of wheat Most of these native grains were nearly lost under Soviet central agricultural planning and the pair are doing their bit to bring them back and in doing so helping to reduce the country s dependence on Russian wheat They ve partnered with a nonprofit organisation that distributes endemic seeds to Georgian farmers Gunda buys the flour they produce for use in the restaurant kitchen As we tuck into the flaky hot from the oven Meskhetian khachapuri stuffed with buttery stringy cheese while sipping glasses of crisp Chinuri white wine Levan tells me he and Lali are lobbying to have khachapuri recognised by UNESCO as part of the country s intangible cultural heritage Georgia is such a small country most people don t even know where it is We want to preserve our cultural uniqueness and identity while saying something new he says Khachapuri is much more than a food in Georgia it s a symbol Gunda s pan fried Imeretian khachapuri Photograph by Nino
