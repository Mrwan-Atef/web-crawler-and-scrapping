through a crisp golden pastry shell and the reward of soft clouds of sweetened ricotta await Sicily s emblematic dessert the cannoli has captured the palates of food enthusiasts worldwide but there s also a fascinating story behind its shape It s thought cannoli have been around since the Middle Ages with some accounts suggesting they were first made while Sicily was under Arab rule One legend has it that in the ninth century cannoli were invented by a harem of women residing in Caltanissetta derived from the Arabic Qalʿat an nisā ʾ meaning castle of women To pass the time during the long absence of the groom the women of the castle dedicated themselves to the preparation of various foods especially sweet treats They re said to have crafted the very first cannoli to honour the virility of their emir Following the island s conversion to Catholicism in the th century the production of cannoli became synonymous with Sicily s monasteries and convents The recipe was preserved by nuns who d prepare them for special occasions and religious festivals a tradition that dates back to Ancient Greece In antiquity the making and consumption of suggestive foods was associated with celebrating fertility and helped foster a connection with the divine During Carnival a pre Lenten celebration the phallic shaped cannoli became tokens of desire exchanged with playful lyrics Men would gift the treats to prospective lovers to show their affections singing Ogni cannolu è scettru d ogni Re lu cannolu è la virga di Mosè Every cannolo is the sceptre of every king the cannolo is the penis of Moses The recipes were closely guarded by nuns who over the centuries secretly passed their baking techniques down the generations without ever writing them down Since the th century the nuns produced numerous sweet treats that were served to the aristocratic families of Palermo through a small hatch from the monastery The tradition of monastic baking is preserved by the dolceria of Santa Caterina
