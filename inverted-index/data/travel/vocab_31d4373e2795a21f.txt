drawn carriages in Central Park circa Universal History Archive Universal Images Group via Getty Images The history of Central Park Like the city s subway system the vast and majestic Central Park a rectangle of open space in the middle of Manhattan is a great class leveler exactly as it was envisioned Created in the and by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux on the marshy northern fringe of the city the immense park was designed as a leisure space for all New Yorkers regardless of color class or creed Central Park is actually only the fifth largest park in New York City trailing behind other local greenspaces like Pelham Bay and Van Cortlandt parks in the Bronx the Greenbelt on Staten Island and Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens But over acres is nothing to sneeze at in tony dense upper Manhattan even in the mid century when New York City was just a fraction of its present size much of the land had to be acquired by eminent domain A couple pauses for a cigarette in snowy Central Park Phil Greitzer NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images Ironically what is now Central Park was commandeered from settlements like Seneca Village home to the very immigrants and free Black community members the park was ostensibly supposed to benefit From that raw swampy material Olmsted and Vaux were tasked with creating a place where the rich could see and be seen in their carriages and promenading in fine clothing and later where the middle and lower classes could gather away from pubs and in lieu of garden cemeteries Olmsted was inspired by Birkenhead Park near Liverpool the first taxpayer funded public park in England during a trip he later recounter in his travel memoir Walks and Talks of an American Farmer in England The trick of course would be to create what felt like a natural American landscape where once there had been pig mucks and and urban detritus Statue of Romeo and Juliet in front of the Delacorte theatre in Central Park Ruben Martinez Barricarte Alamy The result was after many years huge sums of money thousands of laborers and slow progress during the Civil War a sprawling green space that felt distinct from the city bordering it in both its democratic vision and pastoral expanse It was also a triumph of engineering Olmsted and Vaux who also created Prospect Park in Brooklyn were determined to keep foot and road traffic separated and cleverly designed the crosstown transverses under elevated roads to do so It s also an oasis from the urban crush the lush lawns cool forests flowering gardens glassy bodies of water and meandering wooded paths provide the dose of serene nature that New Yorkers crave Central Park Upper West Side and Beyond Ryan D Budhu Getty Images The legacy of Central Park The success of Olmsted s vision and his first major project went on to launch his career and influence generations of landscape architecture with commissions from Buffalo to San Francisco from the manicured grounds of the Biltmore Estate to the trailing parks of Atlanta It s no wonder it s one of the most popular film locations in cinematic history cropping up not just as a background but a character in movies like Hair When Harry Met Sally Enchanted and The Muppets Take Manhattan It s also no wonder that Central Park quickly became a nexus of New York architecture fringed by buildings that both benefit from proximity to the city s back yard and try to live up to its larger than life legacy From penthouse apartments of the Dakota Building where Lauren Bacall John Lennon and other luminaries lived to recent additions like the tall skinny Central Park Tower that climbs to feet over its namesake the skyline rimming Olmsted s creation is almost as iconic as downtown treasures like the Empire State Building Chrysler
