â thank you in Arabic will earn you the appreciation of locals Familiarize yourself with the rules of social interaction When meeting an Emirati of the opposite sex donâ t reach out for a handshake

rules of non verbal communication In Emirati culture non verbal communication is important so be conscious of your body language especially in formal situations Whether in a majlis an Emirati home or a government office donâ t sit with your knees crossed over each other or with one leg resting on the other knee such that your foot is pointing at or your sole is facing someone â both are considered insulting Pointing at someone with your index finger beckoning with it or wagging it while emphasizing your point is rude Use your right hand to accept or offer something such as a cup of gahwa Arabic

day at restaurants and cafes in shopping malls hotels and elsewhere The law requires that non Muslim visitors only eat and drink including water and chewing gum at restaurants and designated spots such as mall food courts out of consideration for those fasting Most non fasting residents maintain discretion as a matter of social courtesy You will not be arrested for sipping water outside on a hot day but do your best to do so out of sight and be ready to apologize if required Donâ t blast loud music in public places â use headphones instead Modest dressing in clothes that cover the shoulders and legs is appreciated A woman dressed in modest clothing walking through the courtyard at Sheik Zayed Grand Mosque Cavan Images Getty Images Know the code of conduct at the Sheikh Zayed
