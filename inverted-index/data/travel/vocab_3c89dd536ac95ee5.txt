locales He camped on Nova Scotia s Mosher Island kayaked across the harbor in Ferry Terminal Park and soared above Prince Edward Island s northern coast The trip echoed a childhood adventure with his

different While in the city he indulged in the local seafood watched the ferries cross the harbor and toured the town s historic streets For someone like Donovan who isn t in love with big city life this provincial capital is just the right size Nova Scotia feels like one big small town he says A sea kayaker paddles through the choppy waters of the Atlantic on the coast of Ferry Terminal Park in Nova Scotia The public green space sits at the edge of Halifax and offers excellent views of the city s harbor It wasn t long before Donovan was out on the water himself Mosher Island an off the beaten path spot accessible only by boat rests on Nova Scotia s southeastern coast It was there that Donovan experienced his favorite adventure of the trip He kayaked to the island s rocky edge and set up camp under the stars From his tent he heard the waves of the Atlantic Ocean crashing and watched the harvest moon rise over the island After a day on the water travelers set up camp beneath a pink and purple sunset on a rocky cove on Mosher Island The ocean brings life to communities in Nova Scotia New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island Visitors arrive to take in its adventures like

traditional fishing methods September s harvest moon rises over a glowing campsite on Mosher Island The site is accessible only by water and the campers kayaks rest on the rocks below While the

Breton a northern Nova Scotian island The national park holds much of Cabot Trail a scenic highway loop that covers some of the northwestern and northeastern coasts of the island and the northern edge of the park Within this protected area visitors will find cliffs and canyons ready for discovery and forests and lakes ripe for exploration Donovan ventured into this part of Nova Scotia to hike the Skyline Trail an accessible endeavor that takes two to three hours and covers a mile loop Clouds roll over the lush forested river canyons of Cape Breton Highlands National Park Because the island rests between the Gulf of St Lawrence and the Atlantic Ocean the weather can change quickly and sometimes a magical fog will settle between the mountains A river slices through the verdant Cape Breton Highlands National Park Though the park is nearly surrounded by saltwater these freshwater rivers and lakes provide an important ecosystem for its varied plants and animals Sunlight peeks through thick hemlocks in year old Victoria Park a thousand acres of natural wonder located in Truro Nova Scotia Truro near the center of Nova Scotia is sometimes referred to as the hub of the province for

square miles about the size of Delaware in the United States but it s home to an array of environments from the inland forests to its coastline bays Plus being the only Canadian province with no land border visitors are never far from the beach While discovering the island Donovan ventured to local fishing villages journeyed along breathtaking red cliffs and spotted the province s lounging sea life A bright green forest and field contrast the ruddy shores of Prince Edward Island The red hue of the shore s rocky sandstone cliffs is due to the amount of iron oxide rust in their composition Nearing the end of his Maritime adventure and to round out his time in these oceanside provinces Donovan visited la Dune de Bouctouche a sand dune in New Brunswick The beach is home to the Irving Eco Centre dedicated to protecting the local coastal ecosystem He walked along the center s boardwalk and visited the nearby beach but the center also features nature exhibits films and a saltwater aquarium all in service of the center s mission to show locals and travelers the value of the landscape and its wildlife A boardwalk stretches across the Irving Eco Centre la Dune de Bouctouche a seven and a half mile sand dune located on the Northumberland Strait of New Brunswick The half mile walkway allows visitors to experience the dune and salt marshes without damaging the ecosystem Donovan ended his trip where he began in Nova Scotia s Halifax with just enough time to take in another sunset over Halifax Harbour This was the end of this trip but not necessarily the end of his time in the province Thinking of a possible future visit Donovan says I d love to go back to Nova Scotia and experience it at an even slower pace Benches line the sidewalks of Ferry Terminal Park
