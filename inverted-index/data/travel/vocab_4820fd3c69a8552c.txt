make the perfect stollen for Christmas A German Christmas classic this sweet bread comes in numerous delicious varieties By Jürgen Krauss December This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK For me stollen and in particular Dresden style stollen is inseparable from Christmas Usually my parents would give it to me as a Christmas gift and it was a real treat on the coffee table This sweet German bread is available in many different varieties but whichever you decide to make here are a few tips to help make it perfect The first written mention of stollen from describes a long bread made of flour water and oil Around though a baker called Drasdo from the city of Torgau made what can be seen as a real ancestor of modern stollen as it was enriched with butter Today there are over types Fillings flavourings Stollen is enriched with butter and other dairy such as quark yoghurt or cream Nuts almonds hazelnuts walnuts fruit raisins currants sultanas candied fruit and peel seeds traditionally poppy and spices such as cardamom and nutmeg are a given Marzipan is an optional extra Raising agent A pre ferment flour mixed with milk and yeast a day ahead is common but a sourdough starter can also be used Quarkstollen a variety using quark cheese is simpler as it s leavened with baking powder and is delicious right after baking and cooling but will improve over time Shaping Turn your dough out onto a well floured surface and shape into a flat rectangle Fold in half lengthways no need to tuck in the edges If adding marzipan roll it into a log as long as your stollen flatten it slightly and place along the centre of the dough before folding Mat uring A fresh yeasted or sourdough stollen will be quite crumbly it takes at least three weeks to develop its texture and flavours Brush it with melted butter and let that set completely before dusting with icing sugar Then store it wrapped in foil or a sealed container at room temperature Serving Use a serrated knife to carefully cut your stollen Slices shouldn t be too thick about Spread some butter and honey if you like on it and enjoy with tea or coffee A yeasted stollen will last several months in an airtight container a baking powder version will last weeks Dresden style Christmas stollen recipe The most famous and celebrated stollen is Dresdner stollen now trademarked from the city of Dresden in Saxony It s laden with fruit and is made with double cream and lots of butter It keeps extremely well and needs several weeks to mature and let all the flavours unfold Serves Takes hrs plus overnight resting Ingredients For the starter bread flour instant yeast double cream For the dough raisins sultanas currants rum bread flour plain flour caster sugar instant yeast ground mace ground cardamom ground cinnamon lemons zested unsalted butter cubed room temperature mixed peel ground almonds unsalted butter melted for coating icing sugar for coating Method To make the starter mix the flour instant yeast and cream together and leave to stand at room temperature for hr Put the starter in the fridge overnight Meanwhile the same day boil a kettle Put the raisins sultanas and currants in a bowl Add the rum then pour as much boiling water over the fruit as needed to just cover them Cover with clingfilm and leave to stand overnight The next day prepare the dough Mix together the starter both flours sugar yeast spices and lemon zest Work the butter into this mix and knead This might seem impossible at first but it will come together nicely I like to do it in a litre bowl using my hands normal household mixers won t be able to cope with this dough Drain the dried fruit and add to the dough along with the mixed peel and ground almonds and incorporate into the dough use a big plastic spatula and work until it all comes together Use your hands to push the dough into a rectangle and fold it lengthwise onto itself Add a little flour if it gets too sticky You can make one large stollen or a few smaller ones but I wouldn t recommend making stollen smaller than I find larger stollen give a better texture Transfer the stollen onto a lined baking sheet and leave to prove at room temperature for around hrs The stollen will hardly rise Heat oven to fan gas Bake the stollen for hr to hr mins depending on size until it s dark golden brown if it gets dark too early cover it with foil While the stollen is still hot brush it with melted butter until it s saturated Once cool cover the stollen in plenty of icing sugar and keep it in an airtight container or plastic bag for at least weeks before cutting into it It will last for several months in an airtight container Dresden style Christmas stollen recipe Taken from German Baking Cakes Tarts Traybakes and Breads from
