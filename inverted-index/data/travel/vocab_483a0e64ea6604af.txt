west bank A new wing was opened in dedicated to the glory of Thebes during the New Kingdom period The highlight and the main reason for the new construction is the two royal mummies Ahmose I founder of the dynasty and the mummy some believe to be Ramses I founder of the dynasty and father of Seti I beautifully displayed without their wrappings in dark rooms Other well labelled displays illustrate the military might of Thebes during the New Kingdom the age of Egypt s empire building including chariots and weapons On the upper floor the military theme is diluted with scenes from daily life showing the technology used in the New Kingdom Multimedia displays show workers harvesting papyrus and processing it into sheets to be used for writing Young boys are shown learning to read and write hieroglyphs beside a display of a scribe s implements and an architect s tools Back in the old building moving up via the ramp to the floor you come face to face with a seated granite figure of the legendary scribe Amenhotep No son of Hapu the great official eventually deified in Ptolemaic times and who as overseer of all the pharaoh s works under Amenhotep III BC was responsible for many of Thebes greatest buildings One of the most interesting exhibits is the Wall of Akhenaten a series of small sandstone blocks named talatat threes by workmen probably because their height and length was about three hand lengths that came from Amenhotep IV s contribution at Karnak before he changed his name to Akhenaten and left Thebes for Tell Al Amarna His building was demolished and about blocks used to fill in Karnak s ninth pylon were found in the late and partially reassembled here The scenes showing Akhenaten his wife Nefertiti and temple life are a rare example of decoration from a temple of Aten Further highlights are treasures from Tutankhamun s tomb including shabti servant figures model boats sandals arrows and a series of gilded bronze rosettes from his funeral pall A ramp back down to the ground floor leaves you close to the exit and beside a black and gold wooden head of the cow deity Mehit Weret an aspect of the goddess Hathor which was also found in Tutankhamun s tomb On the left just before the exit is a small hall containing of statues that were uncovered in Luxor Temple in All are magnificent examples of ancient Egyptian sculpture but pride of place at the
