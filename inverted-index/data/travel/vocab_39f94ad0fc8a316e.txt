of Nepal s stunning sacred sights and magnificent mountains Â fotoVoyager Getty Images Nepal is small in size but itâ s big on variety Best known for its mountains the Himalayan nation also contains historic towns wildlife filled national parks Hindu and Buddhist pilgrimage sites tea fields and much more When planning your trip to Nepal your main activities should determine your destinations To trek head to the mountains naturally But which mountains Different regions offer different experiences and are more or less challenging to reach from the main cities To help you choose hereâ s a round up of the top places to visit in Nepal whether you want to do some gentle sightseeing or have more active plans Kathmandu Valley Best for historic palaces and temples Advertisement Almost all trips to Nepal start in the Kathmandu Valley and the capital region deserves plenty of time Historically composed of several separate kingdoms â the most prominent being Kathmandu Patan Lalitpur and Bhaktapur â nowadays the roughly wide mile Kathmandu Valley is one big urban sprawl with ever diminishing farmland around the edges The human history of the valley dates back millennia and visitors can still see ancient temples and medieval palaces and encounter traditional indigenous Newari culture among the haphazard modern concrete constructions Of greatest interest to travelers are central Kathmandu Patan and Bhaktapur These three ancient towns together comprise a UNESCO World Heritage Site with seven different monument zones the Durbar royal Squares of Kathmandu Patan and Bhaktapur and the Hindu and Buddhist sites of Pashupatinath Temple Boudhanath Stupa Swayambhunath Stupa and Changu Narayan Note that although the first six are popular tourist destinations far fewer people visit Changu Narayan on the north eastern edge of the Kathmandu Valley so head there to avoid the hustle in peak season Planning tip Despite common misconceptions Kathmandu isnâ t all that high at youâ re extremely unlikely to feel any effects of altitude and the weather leans hot more often than not especially between March and October Ready to go Here s our seasonal guide to the best time to visit Nepal Many people visit for Nepal s incredible trekking routes and a glimpse of Mt Everest Sagarmatha Â Getty Images Solukhumbu District For the mighty mother mountain Sagarmatha aka Mt Everest When the weather is really really clear and if you know exactly where to look you may be able to get a glimpse of a sliver of Mt Everest Sagarmatha in Nepali Chomolongma in Sherpa from Kathmandu Otherwise youâ ll need to head to the Solukhumbu District north east of the capital to see the worldâ s highest mountain Thereâ s no road to Everest on the Nepal side of the border so most people embarking on the Everest Base Camp trek in the Solukhumbu District fly from Kathmandu to Lukla a village a few daysâ walk from the mountain Solukhumbu contains the Sagarmatha National Park and is mostly home to Sherpa people who have a distinct Tibetan derived culture Planning tip If you donâ t have time to trek into the Solukhumbu District take a scenic Everest flight from Kathmandu for views of the mountain Get ready to trek to Everest Base Camp with our planning guide Mustang Best for a taste of Tibet Advertisement On the northern side of the Annapurna Range on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau is the Mustang Region a barren windswept landscape thatâ s home to ethnically Tibetan people Catch a short flight from Pokhara to Jomsom through the deepest gorge in the world the Kali Gandaki Gorge or take a bone rattling mile ride in a Or trek there on the Annapurna Circuit Mustang is divided into Lower and Upper and the distinction matters Lower Mustang is easily accessible aside from the logistical challenge of getting there to all whereas non Nepali tourists can only visit Upper Mustang on a guided tour and have to pay a hefty fee of at least US for a special day permit and US per day thereafter Highlights include the apple growing village of Marpha Kagbeni village on the Kali Gandaki River the Muktinath Temple Hindu pilgrimage site and Upper Mustangâ s walled capital Lo Manthang Planning tip Mustang is all but inaccessible during the monsoon June through to early September when the roads are often washed out and flights frequently canceled and the winter when it s extremely cold and snowy especially Upper Mustang Head to Pokhara for mountain views and mellow lakeside experiences Â Rupad Bajracharya Pokhara Best for a chilled out lakeside vibe Pokhara miles west of the capital and Nepalâ s second city couldnâ t be much more different from Kathmandu On the shores of Lake Phewa Phewa Tal and sitting at the foot of the Annapurna Himalaya the mountain views from Pokhara are next level Many people come to Pokhara on the way to and from a trek in the Annapurnas as there are vehicle connections and flight to far flung mountain towns from here You can also enjoy paddling a rowboat on the lake affordable sundowners on the Lakeside strip white water rafting on the Seti River paragliding from Sarangkot Hill visiting the Shanti Stupa World Peace Pagoda and riding the Annapurna Cable Car up to a lookout across the mountains Planning tip If you suffer from respiratory conditions or are traveling with kids you may want to prioritize Pokhara over Kathmandu as its air quality is better and thereâ s less traffic Annapurna Himalaya Best for numerous trekking trails You donâ t need to venture far beyond Pokhara to reach the Annapurna Himalaya â the trailheads for many treks into this range begin around an hourâ s drive from the city From the distinctive pointed peak of Mt Fishtail Macchapucchre to the snowy hulk of Mt Dhaulagiri the Annapurnas are a seriously impressive mountain range Active travelers have many trekking options Australian Camp Dhampus and Poon Hill are among the best places in Nepal to visit with family as the treks are easy but the views no less spectacular If you have more time and stamina the Annapurna Circuit Annapurna Sanctuary Mardi Himal and Lake Tilicho treks are some other options Planning tip If youâ re looking for the best places to visit in Nepal for a day visit combine a couple of days each in Kathmandu and Pokhara with a short trek in the Annapurna Himalaya and maybe even a jungle safari in Chitwan Struggling to choose a hiking trail Here s our guide to Nepal s best route The Maya Devi Temple in Lumbini is believed to be the birthplace of Buddha Â Photohipster Shutterstock Lumbini Best for Buddhist temples and pilgrimage spots Travelers with an interest in Buddhism wonâ t want to miss Lumbini in far western Nepal as itâ s where the historical Buddha Prince Siddhartha Gautam was born Lumbini is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and as well as the modest attractions directly related to Buddha such as the Maya Devi Temple where itâ s believed he was born the town contains temples and monasteries built by many Buddhist nations and organizations from around the world Thereâ s a small international airport in Lumbini or it s a long drive from Kathmandu or Pokhara Chitwan National Park Best place for wildlife safaris Nepal isnâ t all about the mountains The jungle filled plains of the Terai the southern border area beside India are home to an array of birds and animals including the vulnerable one horned rhinoceros whose population has swelled in Chitwan over the last decade Royal Bengal tigers gharial and mugger crocodiles and various kinds of deer and birds The Chitwan National Park is the most popular of the reserves and parks on the Terai as itâ s easily accessible from both Kathmandu and Pokhara From Sauraha town you can go on safari in the park visit wildlife rehabilitation centers and learn about the indigenous Tharu people of Chitwan Planning tip Visit Chitwan in late January or early February when locals clear the long elephant grass and the wildlife hiding within becomes more visible Ilam Best for tea fields and Mt Kanchenjunga views Often overlooked by travelers because itâ s a bit out of the way in eastern Nepal Ilam is the center of Nepalâ s tea production industry Despite bordering tea capital Darjeeling in India Ilam is less of a household name in the tea world but it shouldnâ t be Travelers can tour the tea fields and admire the views of Mt Kanchenjunga the third highest mountain in the world which sits on the Nepalâ India border north of Ilam Trekking routes in this part of Nepal are similarly lesser known but there are plenty of options including the rugged and challenging Kanchenjunga Circuit Trek Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Nepal Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For
