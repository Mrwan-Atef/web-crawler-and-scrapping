first glimpse of Angkor Wat â the ultimate expression of ancient Khmer genius â is matched by only a few select sites on earth such as Machu Picchu and Petra Angkor Wat has the epic proportions of the Great Wall of China the detail and intricacy of the Taj Mahal and the symbolism and symmetry of the Great Pyramid at Giza all rolled into one The vast moat would make most European castles blush It rings a huge rectangular compound measuring by miles by miles To the west a sandstone causeway crosses the moat leading the faithful into the sacred temple grounds Angkor Wat also replicates the spiritual geography of the universe in miniature The central tower represents Mt Meru the Mt Olympus of the Hindu faith and the spiritual home of the gods while the moat represents the oceans The seven headed naga mythical serpent that guards the causeway is a symbolic bridge for humankind to reach the abode of the gods Decipher Angkor Wat s ornate bas reliefs Visitors to Angkor Wat are first struck by its imposing grandeur and then at close quarters by its fascinating decorative flourishes Stretching around the outside of the central temple complex is an long sequence of incredible bas reliefs with intricate carvings depicting historical events and stories from Hindu mythology The most famous of these are panels showing the Churning of the Ocean of Milk â the ancient Hindu creation story â and a frieze featuring Suryavarman II and his all conquering armies on the march The glory of Angkor Wat lies not just in its grand buildings but in the details Anders Blomqvist Getty Images Spot the temple s heavenly angels Angkor Wat is famous for having some beguiling apsaras celestial nymphs carved into its walls Each of them is unique and there are different hairstyles for budding stylists to check out Many of these exquisite carvings were damaged during efforts to clean the temples with chemicals during the and bat urine and droppings have also degraded the carvings over time but they are being restored by teams from the German Apsara Conservation Project Ascend to the Bakan Sanctuary The stairs to the upper level of the temple are deliberately steep â reaching the kingdom of the gods was never meant to be an easy task Also known as the Bakan Sanctuary the upper level of Angkor Wat is open to a limited number of visitors per day with a strict queuing system At the summit four Buddha images stand in the doorways of the central tower showing the temple s transition from Hinduism to Buddhism under King Jayavarman VII From this elevated position there are impressive views across the vast temple compound and surrounding forest My favorite thing to do in Angkor Wat One of the best ways to escape the crowds at Angkor Wat is to enter via the back door on the east side of the temple before sunrise As you walk through the forest alive with the sounds of cicadas and birdsong the shadowy outline of this world wonder is barely visible against the dark sky Bring a torch flashlight and shine it towards the lower level to bring epic carvings alive from the darkness Then succumb to temptation and join the masses for the main event â which is watching sunrise from the western side of the temple Huge blocks of sandstone were moved over miles to build Angkor Wat Gerard Trang Getty Images Learn more about Angkor Wat You ll gain more from a visit to Angkor Wat if you read up on how this magnificent monument was built and why Who built Angkor Wat Oriented toward the west Angkor Wat was built by King Suryavarman II who reigned from to BCE but the temple was never finished during his lifetime In Hindu culture west is the direction symbolically associated with death which once led scholars to conclude that Angkor Wat must have existed primarily as a tomb given that most Khmer temples are aligned facing east This idea was supported by the fact that the magnificent bas reliefs were designed to be viewed in an anticlockwise direction a practice associated with ancient Hindu funerary rites However the Hindu deity Vishnu is also frequently associated with the west and it is now widely accepted that Angkor Wat served as both a temple to Vishnu and as a mausoleum for Suryavarman II Unlike the other Angkor monuments Angkor Wat was never abandoned to the elements and it has been in almost continuous use since it was built It s still a sacred site so be sure to follow the correct etiquette when visiting Angkor Wat is a functioning place of worship for Cambodian Buddhists Tanison Pachtanom Shutterstock How was Angkor Wat built The sandstone blocks used to construct Angkor Wat were quarried from the holy mountain of Phnom Kulen more than miles away and floated down the Siem Reap River on rafts The logistics of such an operation are mind blowing â according to temple inscriptions the construction of Angkor Wat involved workers and elephants Etiquette for visiting Angkor Wat As the temples of Angkor are a sacred religious site for the Khmer people visitors are asked to dress modestly It is not possible to visit the highest level of Angkor Wat unless your upper arms are covered and your legs are covered at least down to the knees Local authorities have produced a visitor â code of conductâ and a video to encourage appropriate dress and remind tourists not to touch sit or climb on the ancient structures to pay attention to
