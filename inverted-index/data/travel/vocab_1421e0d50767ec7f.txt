read Share Explore the best of Singapore with these great drives Â Calvin Chan Wai Meng Getty Images Founded in as a bustling trading port the modern city state of Singapore is now best known for its diverse blend of cultures and cuisine alongside a rich mix of architecture In the land where skyscrapers are interspersed with traditional colonial architecture greenery and tropical gardens often the best way to take it all in is by road From iconic motorsport inspired Marina Bay night drives to calm coastal routes and tree lined trails here are the best roads to drive in Singapore Marina Bay Street Circuit night drive Best drive for motorsport fans Marina Promenade and back via the Downtown Core loop miles Advertisement It s no surprise that the number one drive for any motorsport fan in Singapore is a lap around the miles circuit that hosts Formula One racing The Marina Bay Street Circuit â or Singapore Street Circuit as it s often called â was the site of the sport s first ever night race in and it remains one of the few circuits that fans can drive around any time of the year albeit not on a race weekend of course The track is best driven at nighttime to get as close to the feeling as possible Starting on the long straight running parallel to the Marina Promenade the road heads north slotting under Benjamin Sheares Bridge before weaving its way left to head back down Republic Boulevard Once around a long sweeping right hand bend the road merges onto the famed Raffles Boulevard named after Sir Stamford Raffles the founder of modern Singapore Cutting through the downtown core Singapore s historical heartland the circuit turns sharply left onto Nicoll Highway opposite the Kranji War Memorial before another sharp right turn onto Stamford Road Just a short way down it s another left turn onto St Andrew s Road and down past Singapore s National Gallery and Recreation Club before turning left down to the intersection with Fullerton Highway Once on the highway it s up to speed as the track fires you north back toward Raffles Avenue running parallel to Raffles Boulevard Wrapping around the modern Esplanade complex the track weaves its way around the waterfront before meeting back up with the start finish line completing the circuit which takes in a good deal of Singapore s iconic city center Local tip Just like the race driving at night brings a whole new dimension to Singapore s central waterfront and the sparkling lights of its towers and main attractions glisten as you drive by Take a break from the city at the Singapore Botanic Gardens Â Getty Images Botanic Gardens loop Best drive for an inner city breather Singapore Botanic Gardens shop to the National Orchid Garden miles Singapore Botanic Gardens is an inner city haven and the

Heritage Site status in While it s not possible to drive into the gardens Cluny and Tyersall Roads wrap their way around the edges of the site where it s possible to slow down and channel some of the zen the garden is famed for Sandwiched between the main thoroughfares of Bukit Timah Road to the north and Holland Road to the south both Cluny and Tyersall Roads provide the link between the two main roads and skirt the gardens on the east and west side respectively For a welcome reprieve from the dense traffic outside of the gardens start off driving north on Cluny Road taking in the sights before turning left onto Bukit Timah Road for a short distance and turning left again to join Tyersall Road heading south Stopping to take in the beauty and tranquility of the hectare acres botanic gardens is a must Due to its proximity to the equator Singapore boasts some of the most beautiful and well kept tropical vegetation in the world With calming lakes rolling lawns and themed gardens the site has a rare patch of dense primeval rainforest that is teeming with over species of vegetation Detour For those with a bit more time on their hands take a detour on the west side of the gardens and head up the winding roads that lead up into the residential areas like Cluny Hill Here it s possible to marvel at the modern villas that overlook the gardens which will be a firm favorite for fans of modern architecture Read more Singaporeâ s best national parks and gardens The Kranji loop Best drive for countryside Singapore Turf Club to the Jalan Bahar and PIE junction miles Advertisement Best known for its sprawling wetlands farms and nature reserves driving around the Kranji reservoir takes in some of Singapore s more rustic countryside Start at the Singapore Turf Club the city state s only horse racing club founded in Head north on Kranji Road in the direction of the Kranji dam The route weaves in and out of industrial districts until the buildings thin out and give way to a narrow strip of road called Kranji Way which skims between the Johor Strait and the still waters of Kranji reservoir Once past the dam the road winds through the open Kranji countryside While the single carriageway road is not exactly fast moving the route allows for time to refocus away from the hustle and bustle of the city and stop at a few of the farms Hay Dairies established in is Singapore s only goat farm and is home to around mixed breed goats After you get back on track the route passes by the Kranji Sanctuary Golf Course and a little further on the Kranji Marshes nature reserve For keen hikers the marshes provide the ideal opportunity to jump out of the car and stretch their legs before continuing on Once past the marshes and around a few kinks the road straightens and widens as it heads south to link with PIE and KJE highways and Woodlands Road which fires you back up to the intersection with the Turf Club completing Singapore s best countryside loop Read more The best hikes in Singapore Cable cars going to Mount Faber which offers panoramic city views and can also be reached by motor vehicle Â Getty Images Mount Faber Park Best drive for seeing the city from up high Kampong Bahru Road to Morse Road via the peak miles Mount Faber â as the name suggests â is the best place to view the city from above and the road leading to it is the closest youâ ll come to a twisting mountain pass in Singapore Standing above the city the peak is a popular tourist spot that offers panoramic views over Singaporeâ s sprawling Central Business District and the coast Branching off Kampong Road heading north take the exit for Mount Faber Road At this point the road starts climbing and weaving its way up Mount Faber narrowing to a single lane one way as you get closer to the top Lined with lush and dense foliage the road is a popular route for those seeking a little bit of altitude to escape the bustling city center After a mile or so the road levels out as you approach the peak which houses restaurants and the Mount Faber cable car Once past the peak the road winds its way down the hillside to join Morse Road and eventually the busy West Coast Highway Local tip Various lookouts along the route provide the perfect opportunity to get a snap of the view from the top Find history on remote roads Best drive for history buffs Admiralty West Changi mi There are a few places in Singapore where you can still see the hundred year old historical black and white bungalows built by the former British colonial rulers Today they are owned by the local government and they re only accessible by car The peaceful picturesque drive takes you on secluded roads set amidst towering native Tembusu trees â the massive heritage mansions tucked away on the side of the road are a stark contrast of opulence against nature Admiralty Road West East and Seletar in the north area Mount Pleasant Road and Rochester Park in the central region and Changi Road in the east all offer takes on this scene highlighting the bungalows juxtaposed with verdant jungle like scenery Do bear in mind that at night these routes are exceptionally lonely and a little eerie a fact that invites numerous stories of ghost sightings on these roads Some taxi drivers are known to refuse to travel in this area in the evenings A drive to these spots is best done during the daytime as the bungalows are easier to spot when the sun is out and the ghosts arenâ t around Local Tip On the scenic drive from Admiralty Road East in Sembawang to Seletar you ll pass by Yishun Dam on Lower Seletar Reservoir before you get onto the Seletar West Link road As you cross the reservoir enjoy the serenity of the water on both sides of the bridging road You might even catch anglers fishing or
