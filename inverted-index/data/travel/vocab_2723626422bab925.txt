Arctic Sian Lewis Jan min read Share Leave the bright lights of Stockholm behind and wake up in the Arctic Circle Matthew Micah Wright Getty Images Our slow travel series explores how you can take more mindful journeys by train boat bus or bike â with tips on how to reach your no fly destination and what to see and do along the way Here Sian Lewis explains how she boarded a night train bound for Swedenâ s frozen Arctic Circle from the capital Stockholm Saying goodbye to Stockholm All aboard for the Arctic I was standing in Stockholmâ s Central Station on a December night snowflakes beginning to dust the tracks as a white train chugged to a halt in front of me SJâ s Statens JÃ rnvÃ gar Swedenâ s national train company inaugural service of the Arctic Circle Train would soon trundle from Stockholm to the winter bound north stopping at Kiruna miles north of the Arctic Circle The final stop comes into view some hours later at Narvik in Norway Europeâ s northernmost railhead Advertisement This overnight train had previously been run for years by a Norwegian company VY but SJ had taken it over just in time for its first winter journey of The Arctic Circle service offers passengers the chance to fall asleep in Swedenâ s buzzy capital and wake up in pristine snow laden Lappland â all while saving the price of a night in a hotel or the environmental cost of a plane ticket in a snug bed aboard the train You can now even travel all the way from London to Lappland by train if you so desire The whistle blew at precisely and after lugging my bag aboard I went in search of my cabin Put all ideas of the Orient Express or even the fictional Polar Express train out of your mind â the Arctic Circle service may be bound for Swedenâ s wondrous wilderness but itâ s not especially romantic or luxurious Cabins are functional and can be shared between three or six people while some hardy souls opt for reclining chairs You can book an entire compartment for yourself or share it with others â when sharing travelers choose between women s or men s compartments The Arctic Circle service arrives into snow covered Kiruna Peter Ljungwall SJ Getting comfortable onboard Iâ d splashed out on a second class cabin sleeping three to myself which while still pretty compact did allow me the luxury of privacy My bed had been made up for me and could also be flipped upwards to form a sofa and the rest of the narrow space was made up of a dinky sink a luggage rack and a window from which I could see the last twinkling Christmas lights of Stockholm rush by Toilets and a shower were tucked away down the corridor After unpacking popping my toothbrush by the sink I went in search of supper The trainâ s bistro dining carriage remained open until and was full of excited travelers in hiking gear musing over whether theyâ d see the northern lights at the end of their journey Since this was Sweden the food was on the pricy side but it was also delicious â I sampled a prawn salad Swedish Kroner US and a white wine as the train sped on through the night At bedtime my berth looked far cozier than at first glance a reading light pooling a warm glow onto my pillow I clambered up into my bunk and although I was convinced that I wouldnâ t drop off easily the repetitive rumble of the train soon lulled me to sleep Waking up in the Arctic The next morning a breakfast box and a cup of surprisingly good coffee blew away any cobwebs Although it was the Arctic world outside my window was still an inky blue â at north the sun never rises fully above the horizon during the Polar Night December to mid January Outside my window pines heavily laden with snow slid by We stopped briefly at a tiny platform next to a picture perfect red cabin framed by trees and lit by a single lamp post â it was like a window into Narnia Advertisement At precisely on time hours and almost a thousand kilometers miles away from the bright lights of Stockholm we arrived in the city of Kiruna and I stepped onto a platform thick with snow The air was so cold it hurt to take a deep breath as I watched the trainâ s engines chug into life and continue north to Narvik Camp Ripon is an excellent base from which to explore the Arctic wilderness Camp Ripon Adventures in the snowy wilderness Kiruna is a town on the move â literally Built in to serve the nearby mining of iron ore itâ s now being transplanted house by house to a new location almost two miles away to avoid subsidence Whatâ s left of the current city center is an attractive place under a blanket of snow and still makes a great base for Arctic adventures At Camp Ripan an outward bound hotel focused on sustainability guide Anders Karkea helped me step into snowshoes and we went searching for the prints of reindeer and ptarmigan in a white wonderland of birch and spruce trees We didnâ t see a hint of wild winter beasties but under a blanket of snow Lappland was wonderfully silent and serene save the gentle shushing of our snowshoes Get around quickly in the deep snow with a husky sled Watcharin S Shutterstock While winter hiking is a wonderful way to seek out Lappish nature the most exciting way to get around these parts involves more than two legs I was spending the night at Fjellborg Arctic Lodge and the only way to get there was by husky sled In the midst of the Arctic Night and after a minute lesson on the basics I stood on a wooden sled behind four friendly sled dogs as they mushed over the frozen surface of the Torne River We rushed past the eerie and empty wilderness with only the light of my head torch until we spotted the welcoming lights of the lodge a cluster of cozy red cabins surrounded by pines and complete with crackling wood fires and a traditional sauna This far north youâ re not just in Sweden â youâ re also exploring the land of the Sami the indigenous inhabitants and reindeer herders of Lappland they call their home SÃ pmi At Nuti Sami Siida a Sami run eco adventure company visitors can meet reindeer they like to snack on moss if youâ re keen to make friends and learn more about Sami culture around a roaring fire in a traditional laavu tent It was crisp and beautiful but so cold C F that my eyelashes were frozen white after five minutes of admiring the reindeer and the heat of the tentâ s roaring central fire plus a lingonberry juice fortified with vodka was very welcome indeed Abisko really delivers when it comes to viewing the northern lights Roberto Moiola Getty Images On the rails again to Abisko I reboarded the train in Kiruna for a shorter hop north just over an hourâ s journey to Abisko This would be my last stop but the train ventures on following the Iron Ore Line built in the late to transport ore from the mines of Kiruna You can follow it to the port of Narvik in Norway where a cable car soars high above frozen fjords or to the Swedish coastal city of LuleÃ â at the swish new Arctic Bath hotel you can try ice fishing or dip straight in the LuleÃ River for a proper Scandinavian swimming experience Abisko is Swedenâ s capital of the Northern Lights boasting the highest probability of spotting the elusive aurora borealis between September and March The weather report had promised me only gloomy grey skies but Lappland weaved its magic once again and a shimmering swirl of green danced across the sky as I stepped off the train I crossed the road to the STF Abisko Turiststation a state run hostel that offers budget friendly dorms in a jaw dropping location facing the soaring peak of Mount Nuolja This is an equally rewarding place to visit in summer when the Midnight Sun delivers endless hours for adventuring and hikers can trek a slice of the Kungsleden â Swedenâ s most famous long distance hike â which winds from here through the wilderness for kilometers miles For now the sun felt like a distant memory as I stood in the frosty air strange emerald lights ribboning above the mountainâ s summit and branching out like reindeer antlers across the starry skies Enjoy the sights of Stockholm and then get comfortable in your cabin as you overnight north Kevincho Photography Shutterstock How to make it happen Tickets SJ releases tickets approximately four times a year and some cabins on the Arctic Circle train get snapped up quickly booking ahead is a good idea Choose from a reclining seat from US a bed in a second class couchette sleeping six from US a bed in a second class sleeping compartment sleeping three from US I splashed out on a private second class sleeping compartment from US Food and drink Food and drink are easy to access on board and include tasty suppers such as a Swedish shrimp sandwich US a smoked salmon bagel US and a burrito with black beans US The bar is also well stocked with wine beer and whisky Facilities Luggage storage is available in each cabin The train doesnâ t offer wi fi but does have power sockets Bring earplugs and an eye mask to help block out the rumble and random lights of the train and donâ t forget a good book â Agatha Christieâ s snowbound adventure Murder on the Orient Express would be an apt choice Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers
