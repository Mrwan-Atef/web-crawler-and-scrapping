Michelangelo Square in Florence Italy Andrii Marushchynets Shutterstock Tuscany escapes easy definition The Apennines â Italy â s mountainous spine â slope into vineyard covered rolling hills which in turn fade into the Mediterranean coast This blend of diverse landscapes is home to the remains of millennia old Etruscan settlements isolated hamlets whose stone built bell towers date back to the Middle Ages and grand art cities whose heritage is invaluable With sarcasm being the local language Tuscans may not seem to take such wealth too seriously Understanding the many different facets of this rich Central Italian region can feel overwhelming Florence tends to grab most of the attention but it s worth exploring beyond the Renaissance city to discover more unexpected treasures Whether you are planning an art filled tour of medieval cities a road trip through the twisting countryside roads of Val dâ Orcia or a multi day hike along the Via Francigena pilgrim route here is how to figure it all out Cortona village Tuscany region StevanZZ Shutterstock When should I go to Tuscany Late spring to early autumn is when most people visit Tuscany Itâ s easy to understand why â days get longer and warmer the countryside comes to life outdoor dining opportunities abound and festivals happen all over Florence runs its Calcio Storico tournament and the regionâ s largest music festival Firenze Rocks Siena has its traditional Palio horse race Pistoia hosts its Blues Festival and Cortona its International Photography Festival and thereâ s more Advertisement July and August are peak holiday season Itâ s when most Italians go on holiday and temperatures get scorching â days surpassing have become the norm at this time of the year Visiting in the middle of summer especially August means finding beaches clogged and cities empty Prices are significantly higher in popular destinations and booking accommodation in advance is well advised The two shoulder seasons â either between late April and June or in September and October â typically offer the best compromise between good weather number of people and prices Come in spring and youâ ll see the countryside in full bloom visit in autumn to catch the wine harvest â and related events like the Expo del Chianti Classico in September â and truffle fairs such as San Miniatoâ s White Truffle Exhibition in November Tourism slows down during winter especially after the Christmas holidays The coast goes into hibernation and many countryside hotels shut down until spring Cities offer the chance to visit famous museums without crowds â often at reduced prices as is the case for the Uffizi in Florence â and you can often find deals on accommodation Marciana Marina from the top of Capanne Mountain in Elba Island Tuscany essevu Shutterstock How much time should I spend in Tuscany With so much to see and do itâ s easy to feel overwhelmed in Tuscany There is no perfect length of stay when it comes to exploring the region â whether you feel drawn to art food or the outdoors youâ ll likely leave looking forward to a second trip From Rome you can plan a day trip to Tuscany but more time lets you experience the region s variety With walkable cities well connected by public transport five days will allow you time to tour Florenceâ s main sights and then jump on the train for a day trip in Siena Lucca or Arezzo If youâ d rather drive yourself you can explore Val dâ Orcia in about three days or plan an even longer road trip through hilly landscapes Slow travelers can also walk the path of the Tuscan section of the ancient Via Francigena â the pilgrim route that connected the Canterbury with Rome during the Middle Ages â crossing municipalities over the course of or more days Lucca Italy Is it easy to get in and around Tuscany Tuscany has two international airports Florence and Pisa Pisa s Galileo Galilei PSA airport is serviced by many low cost airlines and has twice the passenger traffic of Firenze s Amerigo Vespucci FLR airport The two cities are connected with a direct railway which takes just over an hour to travel If you re not flying in from abroad it is possible to reach Florence on high speed trains departing from many major Italian cities including Rome Naples Milan Bologna and Venice Tuscany s rail network spans across stations providing an affordable means of exploring the region You can buy regional train tickets online or at any station Remember to validate paper tickets purchased at the station before boarding the train Advertisement Trains do not run to many of the smaller towns While buses are available the best way of moving around rural areas is by car Major rental companies such as Budget Sixt Hertz operate around Tuscany with the largest offer available in Florence and Pisa Top things to do in Tuscany Tuscany is divided into ten provinces and people are famously proud of the defining characteristics of each The days of warring city states are long gone but by speaking to locals you will learn that food dialects and traditions can still differ widely from city to city â here is what to expect Cathedral Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence Olga Gavrilova Shutterstock Visit museums and cathedrals in Florence Renowned for its incomparable Renaissance heritage Florence often feels like an open air museum The Tuscan capital is far from large but its compact historic core packs grandiose cathedrals â such as Santa Maria del Fiore topped by Brunelleschiâ s cupola Santa Croce and Santa Maria Novella â opulent palaces and some of the regionâ s best art museums The Galleria degli Uffizi one of Italyâ s most visited museums tends to be high on everyoneâ s list but there are plenty more options for art lovers including Michelangeloâ s masterpieces in the Cappelle Medicee and the Galleria dellâ Accademia and the Mediciâ s heritage at Palazzo Pitti and Palazzo Vecchio Outside the thick stone walls of its captivating galleries Florence boasts a cosmopolitan character and vibrant culinary scene Roam its markets in San Lorenzo or Santo Spirito explore crafts and design workshops in the Oltrarno and then fuel up with a stuffed schiacciata Tuscan flatbread at Forno Becagli or Sapori Toscani Before dinner get a negroni then hit one of the cityâ s many trattorias Chianti wine region Massimo Santi Shutterstock Go wine tasting in the Chianti region The core of Tuscanyâ s most famous wine region stretches between Florence and Siena offering as many tasting opportunities as you can imagine The Strada Statale better known as Via Chiantigiana runs through the whole of the Chianti region north to south twisting among vineyard covered hills and medieval castles making for an ideal road trip Antinori nel Chianti Classico on the outskirts of Florence is perhaps the regionâ s best known winery â its futuristic headquarters were completed in but the Antinori family has been in the wine business for over six hundred years since Giovanni di Piero Antinori joined the Arte Fiorentina dei Vinattieri Florentine Winemakers Guild in Many other wineries are found along the way including the excellent boutique winery Capanelle and the imposing Castello di Brolio of the Ricasoli winery Siena cathedral LauraVl Shutterstock Explore Siena s gorgeous architecture One of Tuscanyâ s most beautiful squares â Piazza del Campo â marks the center of Siena Florenceâ s eternal rival that emerged during the Middle Ages as a progressive city state where art and architecture flourished Each year the semi circular piazza commonly known as Il Campo hosts the Palio one of the most heartfelt events of the year in which Sienaâ s neighborhoods compete in a horse race with thousands of people watching Siena is worth spending a few days in but if you are short on time make sure to enter its Duomo â Giovanni and Nicola Pisano Pinturicchio Michelangelo Donatello and Gian Lorenzo Bernini all contributed to making the cathedral an unchallenged masterpiece Donâ t miss the floor a composition of marble panels forming a mosaic with scenes from the Old Testament created by various artists between the and centuries Tuscan shop in the medieval village of Pienza Simona Bottone Shutterstock Experience the charm of Val dâ Orcia The postcard image of Tuscany you have in mind likely comes from Val dâ Orcia the UNESCO inscribed region where cypress lined roads lead to dreamy farmhouses surrounded by hay bales that look like they are just about to roll down the hills Films such as Anthony Minghellaâ s The English Patient and Ridley Scottâ s The Gladiator have used Val dâ Orcia as their backdrop and road tripping this region guarantees exceptional views all around Many charming towns dot this rural area The construction of Pienza was commissioned to architect Bernardo Rossellino a student of Leon Battista Alberti by Enea Silvio Piccolomini a humanist born who would become Pope Pius II in as the â ideal Renaissance cityâ and still stands as one of the main settlements in the Val dâ Orcia Nearby you can find the thermal waters of Bagno Vignoni and the fortress of Montalcino globally revered for its prized Brunello wine Piazza del Anfiteatro in Lucca EfrenGlez Shutterstock Visit the walled city of Lucca The tall walls surrounding Luccaâ s historic center built between and and stretching for across eleven bastions are among Europeâ s best preserved fortifications and function as the cityâ s green lung with large parks and tree lined paths offering great views over Luccaâ s heart This charming city makes for an ideal day trip from Florence Inside the fortress walls youâ ll find Luccaâ s Cattedrale di San Martino where Gothic and Romanesque elements blend to form the structure housing one of Tuscanyâ s most precious artifacts â the celebrated Volto Santo holy face crucifix believed to be one of the oldest wooden sculptures in Europe In summer the city hosts its Lucca Summer Festival held in Piazza Napoleone Over the years artists such as Elton John The Scorpions Green Day and Sting have played in the city Another important event is Lucca Comics Games one of Europeâ s largest comics festivals held each year in autumn Piazza dei Miracoli in Pisa Atlantide Phototravel Getty Images Go beyond Pisa s famous tower Pisa is often reduced to its leaning tower but there is much more to see both inside and outside the UNESCO listed Piazza dei Miracoli In the Middle Ages Pisa was one of Italyâ s most powerful maritime republics and signs of its wealth are still part of this city which is now home of one of Tuscany s most important universities The monumental cemetery of Piazza dei Miracoli established in to house the remains of the cityâ s elite houses one of the cityâ s most important frescoes the recently restored Il Trionfo della Morte The Triumph of Death by Buonamico Buffalmacco Beyond Piazza dei Miracoli you find the new Navi di Pisa Museum which traces the history of the cityâ s relationship with the sea and features parts of over ships excavated in Pisaâ s surroundings Elba island in Tuscany leonori Shutterstock Explore the Mediterranean islands Distant from the museums and cathedrals of the region s art cities are seven islands of the Tuscan archipelago ideally positioned for a Mediterranean escape after an overload of culture The islands â Elba Giglio Montecristo Capraia Pianosa Giannutri and Gorgona â come to life during summer and itâ s worth booking accommodation well in advance if you plan to visit in the high season Elba is the largest of the seven offering both great beaches and hiking opportunities along its Grande Traversata Elbana GTE Elbaâ s Great Crossing trail Apuan Alps Tuscany PhotoFra Shutterstock Hike the Apuan Alps The Parco Naturale delle Alpi Apuane stretches across two areas of northeastern Tuscany that few people take the time to visit Lunigiana and Garfagnana The rugged Apuan Alps take their name from their resemblance to the actual Alps although they are much smaller in size with peaks under Historically these mountains have been the main source of Carrara marble extracted since Roman times in quarries surrounding the city of Carrara Today much of the area is a protected nature reserve marked by a vast network of hiking trails The hamlets of Castelnuovo di Garfagnana and Barga are good spots to start your exploration of the region â either by relaxing around the Lago di Vagli or committing to a multi day hike along the Via Vandelli connecting Massa to Modena How much money do I need in Tuscany Costs in Tuscany can vary widely depending on where and when you go Prices tend to be inflated in areas that attract large tourism flows such as central Florence and Siena and skyrocket along the coast during summer months Still it is possible to visit on a budget by relying on public transport and looking for accommodation deals outside peak summer months A guide to daily costs in
