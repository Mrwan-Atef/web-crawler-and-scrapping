Haleakala National Park National Geographic The famed Haleakalā Crater is a vast depression but it s actually not a volcanic crater It was formed as erosion ate away a ridgeline joining two valleys Photograph by Greg Vaughn Alamy TRAVEL Haleakalā National Park November min read Location Maui Hawai i Established August Size acres Haleakalā a giant shield volcano forms the eastern bulwark of the island of Maui According to legend it was here in the awe inspiring basin at the mountain s summit that the demigod Maui snared the sun releasing it only after it promised to move more slowly across the sky Haleakalā means house of the sun the park encompasses the basin and portions of the volcano s flanks A United Nations International Biosphere Reserve the park comprises starkly contrasting worlds of mountain and coast The road to the summit of Haleakalā rises from near sea level to feet in miles possibly the steepest such gradient for autos in the world Visitors ascend through several climate and vegetation zones from humid subtropical lowlands to subalpine desert Striking plants and animals such as the Haleakalā silversword and the nēnē may be seen in this mountain section The summit area depression misnamed Haleakalā Crater formed as erosion ate away the mountain joining two valleys This square mile wilderness area feet deep is the park s major draw From east of the rim the great rain forest valley of Kīpahulu drops thousands of feet down to the coast The upper Kīpahulu Valley is a biological reserve no public access home to a vast profusion of flora and fauna including some of the world s rarest birds plants and invertebrates Some insects and plants evolved in the Kīpahulu Valley and live nowhere else Visitors reach the lower valley of Kīpahulu via the long winding Ha na Highway Dominated by intense hues azure sea black rock silver waterfalls green forest and meadow the coastal area was first farmed in early Polynesian times more than years ago Mark Twain who traveled to Hawai i in may well have had this part of Kīpahulu in mind when he wrote For me its balmy airs are always blowing its summer seas flashing in the sun the pulsing of its surfbeat is in my ear I can see its garlanded crags its leaping cascades its plumy palms drowsing by the shore How to Get There Fly directly from the mainland or from another Hawaiian island to Kahului in central Maui To reach the summit of Haleakalā follow sequentially Hawaii and The mile route is well marked but note the last chance to buy food and gas is at Pukalani or Makawao Continue on the switchback road through miles of lush mountain rangeland to the park s northwest entrance Allow up to hours For the mile drive to Kīpahulu allow up to hours Take Hawaii from Kahului around the northeastern side of the island to the town of Ha na The road to Ha na which becomes Hawaii is famous for its narrow tortuous course along foot sea cliffs into deep gorges This drive affords many views of waterfalls and cascade pools but few places to access them Proceed past Ha na on Hawaii for about miles Follow signs to the park entrance and parking lot When to Go All year park Most rain comes in winter although temperatures remain fairly constant month to month To avoid crowds visit the summit after p m sunsets can be as spectacular as the famous sunrises At Kīpahulu avoid crowds by arriving early or camping overnight Weather varies most at high elevations and can change from very hot to rainy cold and windy in the same day Temperatures can drop to freezing inside the wilderness area although snow is rare Coastal Kīpahulu stays warm but receives considerable rain all year National Geographic Expeditions Travel with National Geographic Search Trips How to Visit It would be neither safe nor very enjoyable to try fitting both the Haleakalā summit and Kīpahulu coastal regions of the park into one day as the Hana Highway drive takes more than six hours alone both ways To absorb more of the ambience of this unique sea girt volcano try to spend a day on the mountain with a hike through the moonscape of the crater and a second day on the coast Van and bus tours some starting in predawn hours take in the magical summit sunrise can be arranged from most island hotels or visit at sunset and wait for the stars to appear From May to September star programs are offered at Hosmer Grove Consider taking a guided walk from Hosmer Grove into the Nature Conservancy s Waikamoi Preserve home of living treasures including various species of honeycreepers the premier family of native Hawaiian birds Reservations required call ahead for the schedule Air tours that fly around Maui and across the park are available from Kahului but regulations limit them to high altitude
