spectacular beaches in Maui to enjoy from sunup to sundown Amy C Balfour Apr min read Share A beach along south Maui Shutterstock From the stunning sunsets at Keawakapu Beach to the wild black sands of PaÊ iloa Beach Mauiâ s sandy shores have a well earned reputation for good reason With year round warm weather and miles of soft sand the island is a sunbatherâ s dream but active travelers wonâ t be disappointed Snorkeling kayaking stand up paddleboarding and surfing are the Valley Isleâ s top activities It s not just about sand and surf â many beaches in West Maui and South Maui are hotspots for wildlife watching Green sea turtles are swimming just off shore year round and in winter migrating humpback whales are putting on a show from beaches up and down the coast you can paddle out from shore in a kayak for a closer look but don t touch or interfere A few things to keep in mind before you dive in at any or all of these beaches Never turn your back on the ocean Waves can be unpredictable and if you re not a strong swimmer only swim at beaches with lifeguards or inlets protected from surf Finally do your bit to protect Mauiâ s marine life by using reef safe non toxic sunscreen In West Maui and South Maui donâ t be deterred by the lounge chairs planted in the sand in front of big name resorts All beaches in Maui are open to the public including the resort beaches Posted signs mark the access points and youâ ll typically find free parking outdoor showers and clean restrooms nearby Now youâ re ready to take the plunge into our list of the best beaches on Maui

truck known for its flavorful drunken noodles and chicken katsu a delicious way to fuel up for your beach day By day there are plenty of things to do in Keawakapu the Kihei Coastal Trail kicks off at

also pleasant for an end of day swim Parking is available at multiple access points along South Kihei Road with lots at the north middle and south ends of the beach Planning tip Snorkelers take note you can often rent gear at a better price at rental shops in nearby towns rather than down on the beach where resorts charge a premium Remember to slap on coral safe sunscreen before kicking off from shore the sun can be unforgiving Kapalua Bay in Maui Hawaii Andrew Allen Media LLC Shutterstock Kapalua Beach Best for families At the southwestern tip of Kapalua this golden crescent is an ideal place for parents and kids to spend the day Families can swim snorkel look for green turtles play in the sand rent stand up paddleboards or simply kick back under an umbrella with a good book The

coast The scenic Kapalua Coastal Trail which wends its way along the shoreline to DT Fleming Beach also starts here Come midday pick up a picnic lunch at the Honolua Store just up the road The scene is low key and the beach rarely feels crowded even though itâ s encircled by upscale condos and luxury resort Montage Kapalua Bay is nearby Parking options include a free lot on Lower Honoapiilani Road street parking and paid spots at the nearby Kapalua Tennis Garden MolokaÊ i is a gentle presence across the channel You certainly wonâ t be alone on Kapalua Beach but its beauty and easy going

swimming bodyboarding sunbathing sunset cruising and strolling along the KaÊ anapali Beach Walk Backed by a one mile stretch of resorts and condos this gorgeous stretch of sand in West Maui is one of the island s recreational hotspots and a must see on any trip to Maui Itâ s also steps away from some of the best beach bars and oceanfront restaurants in Maui There are no lifeguards despite the crowds and currents can be strong ask about conditions at one of the resort beach huts dotting the shoreline Parking is available at Whalers Village for a fee along with nearby public lots There are shops restaurants and a playground in the outdoor shopping mall of Whalers Village Settle in for happy hour at the beachfront Hula Grill Barefoot Bar where youâ ll likely find someone strumming a

mainland so the beach vibe never feels over the top just fun The fun starts early at Wailea Beach flanked by the enormous Grand Wailea Resort and the White Lotus famous Four Seasons this wide sandy beach is abuzz from dawn until dusk Kayaks are lined up beside the ocean in the early morning ready for daily tours while power walkers stride past on the paved Wailea Beach Walk a mile shoreline path

point at the south end of the beach Big Beach in Makena State Park Tim Roberts Photography Shutterstock Big Beach Best beach for wide open spaces Big Beach is a glimpse of Maui untamed Backed by a tangle of kiawe trees and flanked at both ends by lava outcrops this golden strand in Makena State Park stretches for nearly a mile and is free of commercial development The only signs of civilization are the lifeguard station and the pit toilets plus the Jawz Fish Tacos food truck in the parking lot For a sweeping view of the shoreline climb to the top of the lava promontory north of the beach Looking south itâ s immediately clear why Big Beach is known as Oneloa â long sandâ in Hawaiian Turn around for a view of its cute sidekick Little Beach a sandy cove that doubles as an unofficial nude sunbathing spot The ocean at Big Beach is a pretty turquoise blue When conditions are calm you may see kids boogie boarding but at other times the shore breaks can be dangerous and are suitable only for experienced bodysurfers tossed about wildly by the waves Lifeguards are on duty and warning signs are posted for hazardous conditions Planning tip There is a US per person entrance fee and a US parking fee per vehicle Arrive early as parking fills up quickly especially on weekends Mokapu Beach Best for a quieter escape Adjacent to Ulua Beach Mokapu is a quieter spot with fewer crowds and a

nearby Lineage in The Shops at Wailea where you can choose from unique Hawaiian inspired dishes Planning tip Limited free parking is available at the beach access points Bring everything you need as amenities are limited DT Fleming Beach Park Best for stepping into the past Framed by ironwood trees and set on the fringes of the wild northern tip of the island DT Fleming feels like a throwback There s even an old one room schoolhouse beside the parking lot But then you hear laughter from the nearby Ritz Carlton Burger Shack and realize that the comforts of modern life are just a short walk away The Kapalua Coastal Trail connects DT Fleming with Kapalua Beach about miles west Nearby the trail passes two sites of cultural importance to native Hawaiians the Honokahua burial site and Makaluapuna Point keep an appropriately respectful distance from both DT Fleming is a great spot for sunbathing but the beach is also a favorite of wave riders who come here to surf and bodyboard The shore breaks can be rough however and injuries are not uncommon Planning tip There is a free parking lot beside the beach entrance along with lifeguards restrooms and showers at this county run park A black sand beach in WaiÊ anapanapa State Park Matt Anderson Photography Getty Images Maluaka Beach Best for snorkeling and spotting green sea turtles With coral reefs and a soft beach Maluâ aka Beach is a prime destination for snorkeling and sunbathing Protected from trade winds by HaleakalÄ volcano and its national park the water is calm which is a boon to snorkelers and kayakers alike Families with young children can set up near the sandy shallow areas of the beach for gentle snorkeling adventures Green sea turtles or honu are frequently spotted near the shore at this lightly visited beach which is also known as Turtle Town The coral is about yards out from shore and the best spots for snorkeling are at the southern end of the beach Turtles graze their way along the coral banks and often swim near snorkelers Remember not to touch or disturb them in any way Planning tip The beach is located just off Makena Road bordering the Makena Golf Beach Club Parking can be found on Makena Road across from KeawalaÊ i Congregational Church or continue south to Makena Keoneoio Road turn right and follow the signs to the designated parking lot Hamoa Beach Best for imagining you re in the South Pacific If you ve driven the Road to Hana and decided to spend a few days immersed in Hanaâ s many small town charms Hamoa Beach is the place to unfurl your beach towel With its clear water white sand and hala tree backdrop this famous crescent is an East Maui gem Author James Michener once called it the only beach in the North Pacific that looked like it belonged in the South Pacific

Ranch Restaurant nearby for fresh locally inspired dishes or Hana Farms for snacks and refreshments Planning tip Parking is limited to roadside spots along HaneoÊ o Road so arrive early PaÊ iloa Beach Best for black sand beauty The setting of PaÊ iloa Beach is striking turquoise waves crashing against midnight black sand in a small cove fringed by thick tropical greenery Yep the wild beauty of the prettiest black sand beach in Maui is a fitting end to a drive on the Road to Hana But be forewarned the sand and black pebbles on this beach in WaiÊ anapanapa State Park are not cushiony soft Swimming is also a challenge The sea here has a vicious shore dump and undertow with a bottom that drops quickly and challenging water conditions even for strong swimmers After walking across the beach and exploring the sea arch watch your head youâ ll find some of the best experiences along the parkâ s trails which offer stunning views of the cove These trails also lead to an unpredictable blowhole and intriguing sea caves Planning tip Remember that WaiÊ anapanapa State Park requires an advance reservation and there are admission and parking fees so plan accordingly before your visit
