What to see and do in Mahón Menorca Stretching for eight miles Mahón s harbour remains the heart of the city alongside the Old Town which gazes down from a rocky outcrop Photograph by Getty Images Gonzalo Azumendi TRAVEL Why Menorca s capital is one of Spain s most underrated cities The capital of the quiet Balearic island of Menorca offers an atmospheric old town thriving food scene and tranquil beaches By Annabelle Thorpe April This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK As Spanish cities go Mahon is relatively little known to travellers despite its tumultous history The port city on Menorca s southeast coast has been at the centre of centuries of conflict with everyone from the Moors to the Ottomans and French taking control of its natural harbour the second largest in the world But it was the British who left their mark ruling from the early to the early century leaving a series of military buildings along the waterfront and on nearby islands Stretching for eight miles the harbour remains the heart of the city alongside the Old Town which gazes down from a rocky outcrop The lattice of streets in the Old Town links most of Mahón s major sites Housed in a former monastery the Museu de Menorca offers a good introduction to the island s history Admire the contemporary sculptures in the cloister then walk through eight galleries each focuses on a different era from the prehistoric Talaiotic period to the decades of British rule For a glimpse of life under the Brits head to Ca n Oliver a restored mansion once owned by one of the wealthiest families of the time The Old Town s heart is Plaza de España home to Mercat sa Plaça a collection of cafes and food stalls in the cloisters of a former convent It s the place to buy the island s famous Mahón cheese It has a firm buttery texture and rich slightly salty flavour which intensifies with age Choose from semi curado or viejo seasoned for two five or months respectively While here try coca bamba a plain cake often served with hot chocolate at Sucreria Francesa a pastry shop and cafe or tuck into oliaigua a hearty vegetable soup and sobrasada a spicy spreadable sausage at El Trueno a tapas bar Also in the Old Town is Pastelería Sandra which has been selling classic Menorcan pastries and tarts since try a formatjada stuffed with pork and sobrasada or flaó a circle of pastry around a tangy cheese souffle Es Llonguet Forn Artesà is another favourite bakery not least because it doesn t close from unlike most businesses in town For dinner Ses Forquilles serves classic tapas with a twist like fricandó simmered beef in a bao bun or oysters with wakame and lime Mercat de Peix has the best pintxos Basque style tapas usually on slices of baguette With a long tradition of shoe making Menorca was a major century player in the global shoe industry Local high end brands like Pons Quintana and Pretty Ballerinas selling everything from flats to heels are still popular with celebrities like Kate Moss and Kate Middleton Each has a shop in Mahón although most visitors opt for the island s classic avarca sandals peep toed flat slingbacks from more affordable stores in town For something different Posidònia sells earrings bracelets and pendants inspired by Menorca s landscapes The Old Town represents only half of what Mahón has to offer From the main plazas stairs lead down to the harbour This stretch of waterfront is home to the Xoriguer distillery which claims to produce the oldest gin in the Mediterranean and offers free tastings and bookable tours Alternatively take an hour long boat ride around the area or visit the Hauser Wirth gallery on Illa del Rei Also along the harbour a minute drive from Mahon s centre is the neighbourhood of Es Castell originally built as a British military base The waterfront is lined with fish restaurants and tapas bars and it s a glorious spot for a sunlit lunch whether you go for upscale dining at Sa Punta or opt for freshly caught fish and seafood at Trébol No visit to a Balearic island is complete without an afternoon at the beach The unspoilt swathe of sand in the village of Es Grau is just a minute drive from Mahón s centre It s a gorgeously tranquil spot tucked away in the Parc Natural de s Albufera des Grau over miles of wetlands and olive groves Stay for sunset drinks at Cafe Bar Es Moll perched right beside the water How to do it EasyJet flies to Mahón from UK hubs Recently revamped Catalonia Mirador des Port hotel is a short walk from the Old Town From
