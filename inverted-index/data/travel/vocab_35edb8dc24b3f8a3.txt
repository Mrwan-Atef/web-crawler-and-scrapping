Remember the Alamo A battle brews in Texas over history versus lore TRAVEL WORLD HERITAGE Remember the Alamo A battle brews in Texas over history versus lore A plan to rethink San Antonio s cradle of Texas liberty includes raccoon hatted heroes a rock star and lots of controversy The Alamo Chapel a Spanish mission era structure sits in the main plaza of San Antonio Texas A plan to restore and rethink it for visitors has been highly controversial By Jennifer Barger Photographs by Robert Pluma June min read What happened at the Alamo again asked my cousin who was visiting from Missouri It was sometime in the early and we were in San Antonio lined up to see the best known tourist attraction in Texas As we passed through arched wooden doors into the century mission chapel my sister piped in This is where Mexican general Santa Anna tried to take Texas back from Davy Crockett Of course that wasn t quite right My sister and I grew up in San Antonio but she may have been out sick the day her seventh grade Texas history class covered the Battle of the Alamo Like many locals she bought into the narrative of freedom fighting Texans versus villainous Mexican soldiers As a kid in the late I subscribed to that story too even begging my mother to buy me a facsimile of Crockett s coonskin cap at the Alamo gift shop The conflict actually took place in what was then Mexico Anglo settlers lured to the steamy snake filled state of Tejas by the promise of farmland and autonomy were rumbling for independence from the increasingly centralized Mexican government Nearly of these Texians as both Anglo and Hispanic rebels were known occupied the ruins of Mission San Antonio de Valero nicknamed the Alamo after the Spanish word for cottonwood Outmanned and outgunned by the Mexican army under President Antonio López de Santa Anna the rebels were nearly all slaughtered their bodies burned on pyres in the adjacent plaza The Texians lost that battle but soon after won their war for independence after defeating Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto and cementing the newly formed Republic of Texas in April of Dawn at the Alamo artist Henry McArdle s billboard sized oil painting depicts the legendary battle in San Antonio Texas It hangs in the Texas State Capitol in Austin Niday Picture Library Alamy Stock Photo But the narrative conflict about what happened at this cradle of Texas liberty was far from over A complex argument of facts versus fiction right versus wrong and what the battle was even about hasn t let up since even as Texas became a U S state in and ensuing decades saw San Antonio turn into a majority Latino city No wonder my sister didn t have her story straight Now an ambitious million plan to restore and recalibrate the UNESCO World Heritage Site has spurred a new battle over how to remember the Alamo The Alamo Plan puts forth expansive expensive ideas Preserve the fragile chapel close surrounding streets to car traffic build new museums to tell the site s centuries long history and to house artifacts including a cache donated by rock star Phil Collins But it s all become obscured in a fog of politics claims of poorly authenticated relics and gun toting protesters It s a story as big and as messy as my home state A plan to remember the Alamo differently For a place mythologized in film and song the Alamo can seem tiny and underwhelming to first time visitors The limestone walls of its chapel and adjacent Long Barrack site of much of the fighting are crumbling Museum space is limited to a one room square foot building history is mostly recounted in the surrounding gardens via mounted plaques and a short film What monuments to the Confederacy coming down means for the U S Another surprise The distinctly gabled chapel sits in the center of San Antonio s bustling main square Alamo Plaza not in a tumbleweed filled battlefield It faces a ragtag block of and early century buildings holding a Ripley s Believe It or Not souvenir shops and a wax museum recently in the news because visitors kept punching its Donald Trump dummy On land where Mexican and Texian fighters fell I remember setting off New Year s Eve firecrackers with high school friends and slurping raspas snowcones from stands which operated in the shadow of the Alamo until very recently The Alamo is boring frankly says Austin writer Chris Tomlinson coauthor of the new book Forget the Alamo The Rise and Fall of an American Myth The average visitor spends less than minutes there patrons across the way at Ripley s or the Tomb Rider ride stick around for minutes and they buy a hot dog The Alamo is this fascinating place to think about justice liberty white supremacy and other issues but it isn t being presented that way Learn why Texas has such an independent streak The Alamo Plan was conceived in by state and city forces and the Alamo Trust the nonprofit which manages the site Its goals Preserve the buildings and grounds and make the stories they tell more accurate We want to bring them in with the events of but expand from there says Alamo Trust Executive Director Kate Rogers To a lot of people the Alamo is an enigma Maybe they know the battle but they don t know the place s history as a mission or how San Antonio grew up around it Men load a cannon to fire during a ceremony honoring Blas María Herrera nicknamed the Paul Revere of the Texas Revolution after he warned his fellow Texian soldiers of General Santa Anna s advance on the Alamo Like many Latino supporters of Texas independence Herrera is not well known Birth records from the Mission San Antonio de Valero as the Alamo was known in the colonial era are on display at San Antonio s Witte Museum Besides shoring up the original limestone structures and erecting a state of the art visitors center and museum to showcase artifacts including plus donated by Collins the original Alamo Plan involved changes meant to reclaim the mission era footprint and bring a sense of reverence to the plaza which is both a battle site and a graveyard for fighters on both sides as well as Indigenous mission residents Other proposals would have closed surrounding streets to cars erected exterior glass barriers to delineate the original mission grounds and relocated a foot tall stone monument to the Texian fighters usually called Defenders from one corner of Alamo Plaza to the other The last known as the Cenotaph holds names and bas relief sculptures of Defenders including the holy Trinity Crockett Commander William Barret Travis and Jim Bowie a famed fighter slave trader and the probable inventor of the Bowie knife Controversy surrounds the cradle of Texas liberty Texans take Alamo lore and legends seriously My childhood best friend whose great great great great grandfather died at the Alamo would playground brag that her family was braver than mine When I visited the Texas State Capitol Building in Austin as a teenage government geek I was fascinated by the outsize painting Dawn at the Alamo depicting Travis and Crockett heroically fending off menacing Mexican soldiers It has become like a religion for some people says Indigenous multimedia journalist Robert Pluma a descendent of an Alamo Defender You find conflicting narratives and you need to preserve them while examining the fissures The Cenotaph a memorial lists names of many of the Texians who fought at the the Battle of the Alamo They include photographer Robert Pluma s ancestor José María Guerrero It s no surprise that the Alamo Plan s proposed changes have ignited ongoing debates political posturing and even armed protests Historians seek a more nuanced story about why the Texians were fighting yes for freedom but they also sought the right to keep their slaves then illegal in the rest of Mexico Indigenous Americans want recognition for the mission era and their ancestors buried onsite And traditionalists many descendants of the Defenders vehemently oppose moving the Cenotaph It s our headstone since we don t have a cemetery to go to says Lee Spencer White founder of the Alamo Defenders Descendants Association We want the graves of the heroes to stand out in front of the fort they defended Pluma and other Indigenous and Latino residents see things differently He s currently working on a photo video and oral history project documenting the nearly forgotten Indigenous history of San Antonio s missions including San José where his ancestors lived The Tāp Pīlam Coahuiltecan Nation a consortium of local Indigenous groups has filed lawsuits asking for the Alamo to recognize its onsite cemeteries and for the right to worship inside the chapel Armed protesters gathered at the Alamo in April A plan to move a memorial to Texans who died at the Battle of the Alamo in was met with fierce opposition from traditionalists who believe the structure is an empty tomb Photo by Dave Creaney Anadolu Agency via Getty Images The foot tall Alamo Cenotaph sits adjacent to the Alamo in San Antonio Texas Photo by Dave Creaney Anadolu Agency via Getty Images The Alamo is a symbol of greatness to some people to others it s a symbol of Anglo dominance that is a dark side of our history says Scott Huddleston a veteran reporter covering the Alamo for the San Antonio Express News This plan seeks to address those issues like slavery and the Mexican perspective Still many people want the old good guys versus bad guys story no doubts or additional facts needed A legend is born As usually told the Battle of the Alamo falls into an archetypical heroic narrative of scrappy rebels rising up against a better equipped but villainous force Legend holds that the Texian fighters died to buy time for General Sam Houston and the new Texas Army before their eventual victory at San Jacinto Never mind that this isn t true Plus the mission wasn t on their land some of the fighters were slave owners and Mexico itself was struggling to create a new country Still almost as soon as the cannons stopped smoking Texans began spit polishing the history with contested but rousing tales Crockett went out rifle blazing some Mexican accounts claim he was captured and executed All the fighters crossed a line Travis drew on the ground indicating they were willing to die for the cause most historians say that s a fable The Alamo s iconic bell shaped façade served as a backdrop for the battle actually the U S Army installed it over a decade later when the chapel became a storeroom Find out how the bluebonnet became a symbol of Texas It s myth making almost like was for the U S says Carey Latimore a professor of history at San Antonio s Trinity University who consulted for the Alamo Plan Myths sell books and artifacts but they aren t real history Depictions of the battle on the big and small screens from cartoons to Westerns helped to skew the facts One of the reasons that the myths are so entrenched was because of the popular media in the and says Tomlinson These were profound cultural experiences for Baby Boomers particularly young white men But Generation Z can smell the rotten fish Texas even mandates that schoolchildren be taught about the Alamo Defenders in heroic language Earlier this year a Republican state representative introduced legislation to block the Alamo from mentioning slavery as one of the causes of the Texas Revolution Vintage souvenir plates commemorating the Alamo are displayed at Schilo s Restaurant in San Antonio Texas An Bowie knife in the Alamo s collection was commissioned by Alamo Defender Jim Bowie s brother Rezin The weapons became popular in the century after Jim Bowie a notorious fighter had a similar fixed blade knife made for him According to many historians there are also doubts about the authenticity of some artifacts in the Phil Collins collection reported in the book Forget the Alamo and newsmagazine Texas Monthly The musician started amassing Alamo related documents guns and swords in I don t know that all of those artifacts have been vetted for their provenance says Huddleston The authenticity of a rapier like Bowie knife said to be owned by Jim Bowie was partially confirmed by a psychic the initials D C recently and mysteriously appeared on a rifle that the Collins collection hints belonged to Crockett The problem is that the Alamo Plan is based on the Phil Collins collection and some people think it s just as fraudulent as the Alamo story says Tomlinson A fuller history The history of the Alamo isn t just about the day siege and minute final battle Focusing just on means no one talks about the origins of the mission says Pluma There is so much history connected to these missions that continues to be neglected or deliberately erased The Mission San Antonio de Valero was founded by Catholic missionaries in in what was then New Spain It was the first of five missions built in the area meant to convert local Indigenous people by force and to teach them Spanish They lived farmed and worshipped within the stone walls of the Valero complex which was eventually secularized in the its land and buildings given to residents In the as Mexico sought independence from Spain the mission became a fortress first for Spanish forces then for Mexicans and finally Texians During the Mexican American War from to the Alamo turned into a busy U S Army storage depot Today the five missions form a National Historical Park Ideally the Alamo Plan will find a way to cover not only the famous battle but also the complexities of these other eras It s more interesting if these heroes are shown to be actual men with flaws says Latimore History is about peeling away layers of myth and getting to what actually was Controversies have come close to halting the project Major donors to the Alamo Plan dropped out after the Texas Historical Commission denied the city s request to move the Cenotaph in Texas Monthly ran a June cover story about doubts over the Collins collection the Alamo Trust rebutted that it has meticulously vetted all artifacts But this spring after years of debate there were small signs of change Alamo Street finally closed to car traffic after fierce local opposition meaning the Alamo s costumed historic interpreters representing the mission Mexican and Texian periods can now interact with tourists on the plaza In April a replica of an pound cannon was installed on a faux adobe rampart visitors climb up for a Defenders eye view of where Crockett and company fired at the Mexican Army It looks down on the entrance to the present day River Walk where I sipped margaritas in college A wax museum and other carnival like attractions operate in historic buildings on Alamo Plaza The Alamo Trust announced it would break ground this summer on a state of the art exhibit hall much larger than the current one to showcase historic artifacts including the Collins collection A second proposed space will serve as a visitors center history museum that will finally dig into all of the eras and issues of the Alamo Slated to open in if funds can be raised that museum will incorporate two historic structures on Alamo Plaza including a Woolworth s with significance in Civil Rights era desegregation Many critics say those changes aren t coming quickly enough and that the Alamo s diverse history still isn t being addressed A lot of Texans aren t ready to reconsider the Alamo says Tomlinson But nationally there s a real hunger to reexamine our foundational myths Jennifer Barger who is from San Antonio is a senior editor
