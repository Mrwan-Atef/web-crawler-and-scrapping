An announcement will be made when cabins are ready for passengers if they aren t ready at the time boarding begins Settling into Your Cabin After boarding you will either be able to go straight to your cabin or you may be directed to have lunch in the buffet or in the ship s main restaurant Cabin stewards participate in the ship s turnaround and are extremely busy although yours will no doubt introduce him or herself at the first available opportunity It may be a while before your checked luggage arrives In case your luggage does not arrive before dinner as sometimes happens when you re dining at the early seating it s a good idea to have toiletries and appropriate attire in your carry on so you can freshen up and change Make sure everything in your stateroom is in working order Let your cabin attendant know immediately if something isn t working Checked bags may not arrive for several hours after you board Cabins often feel warmer while ships are docked they cool down when the ship is underway On most ships there will be a muster drill before the ship leaves port The first night s dinner dress code is always casual Your First Afternoon on Board You should find a copy of the ship s daily schedule in the cabin when you arrive Take a few moments to look it over you ll want to know what time the mandatory muster drill takes place a placard on the back of your cabin door will indicate directions to your emergency station as well as meal hours and the schedule for various activities and entertainments For the rest of the afternoon and into the night you may find other introductory activities scheduled such as tours of the spa and fitness center port and shopping talks and casino gaming lessons Check in with the headwaiter if your dining assignment isn t to your liking Take a few minutes to get the lay of the land so you remember your cabin location Make optional specialty dining reservations as soon as possible Book spa treatments there are sometimes specials on the day of embarkation If you have an assigned table at dinner review its location and make changes if you need to Book shore excursions if you haven t booked them in advance of sailing
