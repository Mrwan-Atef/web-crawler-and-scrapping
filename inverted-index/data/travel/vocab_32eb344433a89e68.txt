a budget Daily costs in Chicago Hostel room dorm bed Basic room for two Self catering apartment including Airbnb Public transport ticket day pass Coffee Hot dog Dinner for two Pint of microbrew at the bar Advertisement Figure out which Chicago airport is the cheapest to fly to Chicago has two airports Oâ Hare and Midway Budget airlines fly into both and transport costs to the city center are similar though Midway is slightly cheaper since it is a few miles closer In general budget airlines Spirit and JetBlue fly to Oâ Hare Southwest and Allegiant fly to Midway and Frontier flies to both Oâ Hare is also a hub for United and American Airlines and they often have cut price flights to the city Take the L train from the airport Both airports have easy links to downtown via public transportation â specifically the L train â which costs about US and takes minutes from O Hare and about and minutes from Midway Oâ Hare has its own Blue Line station while Midway has its own Orange Line station trains depart from both every minutes or so This option is much cheaper than taxis Uber or Lyft which can cost times more and take almost as long given Chicagoâ s heavy traffic Make use of Chicago s extensive public transit system to save time and money Andrey Denisyuk Getty Images Use Chicagoâ s public transit system to get around Parking costs will drain your budget quickly Downtown street meters charge about per hour with garages averaging around per day Plus driving in the traffic packed city is maddening â public transit is the way to go Chicagoâ s L train system has eight color coded lines that get you to most sights and neighborhoods Buses pick up the slack in areas that the L misses Ready for a bargain An unlimited ride day pass costs valid on all trains and buses Buy it at any L station including the airports or via the Ventra app You can also buy a rechargeable Ventra Card which saves around per ride over disposable fare tickets for one off rides Hop on a water taxi Chicagoâ s architectural boat tours are wildly popular and no wonder Itâ s awesome to glide along the river and stare up at the skyscrapers But if you canâ t afford to drop over on a guided tour donâ t fret The Chicago Water Taxi plies the river and charges for a day pass Advertisement The boats travel from the Michigan Avenue Bridge to Madison Street and onward to Chinatown so youâ ll still get that wind in your hair experience Visiting during shoulder seasons can save money on hotels ireya Acierto Getty Images Visit in spring or fall to save money Summer June through August is Chicagoâ s peak season when lodging is typically more expensive Winter December through March is the cheapest time to go but the cold and snow arenâ t very inviting Spring and fall are the shoulder seasons when sweet deals and decent weather coincide Consider staying at a hostel Chicago has several great quality hostels The stalwart HI Chicago is right in the heart of downtown Wrigley Hostel parties hard near the north side baseball park and Chicago Getaway Hostel has been hosting travelers for years in the good time Lincoln Park neighborhood Meanwhile Freehand Chicago and Found Hotel are bar laden hostel hotel hybrids at downtownâ s northern edge Look for lodging beyond the core Move away from the Loop Near North Gold Coast and West Loop â Chicagoâ s hotel loaded central districts â and prices tend to be lower Try neighborhoods like Lincoln Park and Lake View both just north of downtown and filled with bars and restaurants and Wicker Park northwest of downtown near buzzy nightlife and shops Cool areas that are even cheaper include Logan Square Pilsen Ukrainian Village and Andersonville Most accommodations in these outlying districts are apartment rentals so you can save additional money by self catering some of your meals It s key to be near an L station though so check this before booking Snag some budget friendly goodies from one of the city s many markets like this one at Daley Plaza Shelly Bychowski Getty Images Plus Graze through a market From May to October farmers markets pop up citywide and offer inexpensive meals Green City Market lays out the largest spread from pies to pickles to pastas on Wednesdays and Saturdays in Lincoln Park The Logan Square market adds live music to its array of fruits veggies and prepared foods on Sundays Downtownâ

lots of high quality cafes and mom and pop restaurants to choose from within walking distance of each other In Pilsen along Street Mexican bakeries and taquerias mix with hipster coffee shops and barbecue joints Chinatown along Wentworth Avenue offers a smorgasbord of tart filled bakeries and dim sum places In Uptown along Argyle Street Thai and Vietnamese noodle houses steam up the corridor known as â Little Saigon â And in Humboldt Park along Division Street homey spots serve strong coffee roasted pork spiced rice and other Puerto Rican specialties Find the food trucks Chicago has a relatively small fleet of food trucks but the ones that do roll serve lip smacking tacos Vietnamese sandwiches soul food and more for modest prices They generally prowl office worker rich zones like the Loop and Near North around lunchtime and then nightlife focused Wicker Park and Lake View in the evening On summer Fridays trucks congregate at Daley Plaza during lunch Check Street Food Finder
