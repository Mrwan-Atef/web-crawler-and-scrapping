Koronakis Aug min read Share Summer sunset over the Acropolis of Athens with the Parthenon Temple Â Sven Hansche Shutterstock Every big city has its invisible side â sites and locales that bear the mark of history but are hidden in the modern cityscape Athens with its long tumultuous history is one such city a destination with unknown corners and untold stories And of course there are contemporary joints that cater to insiders and locals Letâ s uncover some of Athens deepest secrets revealing hidden treasures and legendary tales â some unknown even to locals Advertisement Some of Athens best secrets are just beneath the city Â Sven Hansche Shutterstock Secret history in Athens Temple of Artemis Agrotera On Ardittou str if you climb a few steps from the street level and peep over the metal fence youâ ll get a glimpse of the ruins of the Temple of Artemis Agrotera the goddess of the hunt dating back to the century BC Sadly this important archaeological site has been abandoned as it is entangled in a legal dispute concerning the land ownership Archaeologists are pushing for the issue to be resolved as they insist that the site forms an archaeological unity with the neighbouring magnificent Temple of Olympian Zeus This bridge dates back to Otto the first King of Greece Â Vangelis Koronakis Lonely Planet Ottoâ s bridge Across the street from the Artemis temple but well hidden as it is virtually buried under concrete and unmarked there is a three arched stone bridge dating back to the days of Otto the first King of Greece The bridge is located on the intersection of Ardittou and Athanasiou Diakou str where the only stretch of the ancient river Ilissos bank is still visible abovegound Just look for the steps towards the Temple of Olympian Zeus and climb down into the greenery Bullet marks are believed to be from the Greek Civil War Â Vangelis Koronakis Lonely Planet Bullet marks from the Greek Civil War Not many passers by realise it but the holes on the wall of the building across the street from the Arch of Hadrian at Amalias Av are bullet marks dating back to the devastating Greek Civil War that started in December and lasted until inflicting untold pain upon the country The bullet marks are kept as a grim reminder of this darkest period of modern Greece Advertisement The former site of the Gestapo headquarters Â Vangelis Koronakis Lonely Planet Former Gestapo local headquarters The building on Merlin str a department store these days is marked by a memorial at its entrance The building was the Gestapo local headquarters during the occupation of Greece in WWII Thousands of resistance fighters were taken there after their arrest and tortured to provide information about the movement before they were moved to camps to be imprisoned or executed It is estimated that a few hundred died inside the building Korai str was a very modern building at the time of its construction purpose built for the Ethniki Insurance Company just before WWII broke out One of the requirements was the construction of bomb shelters in its basements During the occupation the building was requisitioned by the Nazis and the shelters were used as a detention centre The site has been conserved by Ethniki and is open to the public daily â except Sun Mon Ammunition was smuggled through the tunnel beneath Agia Dynami during the Greek independence war Â Vangelis Koronakis Lonely Planet Treasures hidden underground The tunnel beneath Agia Dynami Agia Dynami on Mitropoleos str is a Byzantine era church surrounded by a modern hotel building that once housed the Ministry of Education The little chapel which is dedicated to expectant mothers dynami means strength was constructed like many Christian churches on the ancient ruins of the temple of Hercules Under its altar there is a tunnel through which ammunition was smuggled to be used by the fighters against the Ottomans during the Greek War of Independence Ruins of the Temple of Artemis Â Vangelis Koronakis Lonely Planet The underground treasury at the Bank of Greece Most city dwellers admire the large stern building on Panepistimiou str that has housed the headquarters of the Bank of Greece since but few notice the glass bricks on the pavement that let light into the bankâ s underground treasury home to the countryâ s gold reserves Very few people have ever entered this vault and there are no images of its interior for security reasons Logginou Park is usually deserted because of its rumoured hauntings Â Vangelis Koronakis Lonely Planet Where to explore the city s legends Haunted Logginou Park Most famous Greeks are buried in the cemetery of Athens a virtual open air museum with countless statues adorning the famous graves Adjacent to the cemetery lies the Saint Logginou Park a small grove which according to popular legend is haunted by the soldiers who were allegedly found buried there after the war There are claims of strange occurrences and bad energy creating a self fulfilling prophesy which results in the place being deserted most of the time even during the day A childrenâ s playground on the premises with a view to the graves of the cemetery contributes to the eerie atmosphere Satanic rituals were rumoured to have been performed in this building Â Vangelis Koronakis Lonely Planet Rumoured rituals at the Akadimias building One of the narrowest facades in Athens this is actually an annex of a listed property on the adjoining Mavromichali str that used to be the residence of Ernst Ziller a German architect that shaped the neoclassical character of Athens in the turn of century The building is surrounded by mystery and myth which was for decades amplified by a metal ornamental dragon hanging above its door The sculpture was removed in the after stories circulated in the media that the building was connected to satanic rituals The view from the Syntagma Kantina Â Vangelis Koronakis Lonely Planet How to explore modern treasures The Syntagma sq canteen Thereâ s no mystery about this humble canteen except unless you are tipped off it is impossible to find â although itâ s right on Syntagma Square The reason is simple itâ s located on the floor of the office building on Kargeorgi Servias St catering to the building workers for the last four decades However the fame of its simple three items menu has gone beyond the walls of the building and Athenians in the know gather there daily weekdays â to enjoy its delicious potato omelette and tomato salad and meatballs with a direct view of the Acropolis rock to boot Batman bar An institution of Athenian nightlife Batman is a small bar tucked in a narrow street in the residential neighbourhood of Neos Kosmos that comes alive and gets packed after midnight Night owls lonely souls and punters of every walk of life arrive when the rest of the city sleeps to drink and listen to Greek retro music Be prepared to stand very close to others especially on weekends and come only if a thick cigarette smoke cloud won t ruin your night Check out adventure tours for every traveller from our trusted partners Advertisement Advertisement
