Greenland is one of the last places on Earth to explore an ancient Arctic life Hunter Naimanngitsoq Kristiansen rests his team of husky sled dogs on Greenland s sea ice The Arctic region is home to Inughuit people the northernmost group of Inuit Photograph by Paul Nicklen Nat Geo Image Collection TRAVEL This is one of the last places on Earth to explore an ancient Arctic life From traditional foods to handmade goods travelers get a glimpse of Inughuit life in Qaanaaq Here s how to visit this remote coastal community By Justin Fornal December min read An armada of towering icebergs has arrived along the coastline of Qaanaaq Greenland They seem to have appeared in the blink of an eye as if summoned from the depths of Inglefield Bay The floating sentinels some the size of a city block sit scattered casually across the coast With an average drift speed of miles per hour and higher speeds of two miles per hour icebergs can appear quite quickly rendering vital shipping lanes into impenetrable blockades in just a matter of hours Both icebergs and floating ice sheets have been known to halt maritime traffic in towns like Qaanaaq for days and occasionally weeks at a time I know I won t be leaving Qaanaaq by boat anytime soon The area above the Arctic Circle known collectively as the High Arctic is one of the few places on the planet where the traditional rhythms of wind tide and animal movements still direct one s schedule With a current population of Qaanaaq is the central town in northwestern Greenland s Avanersuaq district one of the world s least densely populated administrative zones It is home to a community of Inughuit historically known as Smith Sound Inuit or Arctic Highlanders Until the last century Inughuit peoples survived primarily by utilizing every part of their sea mammal prey In this land without trees everything clothing sleds tools weapons fuel kayaks and even parts of structural dwellings came from sea mammals The villages of northwestern Greenland are one of the last remaining places to experience the remnants of ancient Arctic life Despite modernization and imported goods elements of the traditional diet still hold firm I m here to learn more about these fascinating old foodways and taste some of the delicacies myself from fermented seabird to fresh narwhal Learn about the art of chasing icebergs in Newfoundland Kiviak traditional Arctic food Would you like to try some kiviak It has a strong smell so we have to eat it outside says Birthe Jenson one of the chefs at Hotel Qaanaaq The hotel has long been one of the few places in town where travelers can rent a room It is currently closed as it changes management It s the last comfort stop for many travelers venturing farther north into the vast Arctic wilderness And while there are no conventional restaurants in town some local families are more than happy to accommodate travelers with home cooked local fare Kiviak is an Arctic delicacy made by stuffing hundreds of birds most commonly little auks Alle alle also known as dovekies a small black and white seabird inside of a fresh seal skin Once full the carcass is stitched closed and placed under a mound of heavy rocks to ensure the sunlight does not hit the package Months later the fermented birds are removed cleaned and eaten While traditional animal sourced fermented foods such as kiviak are becoming less common they continue to garner attention for their unique cultural and scientific significance Inuk microbiologist Aviaja Lyberth Hauptmann who recently established a microbiology lab at the University of Greenland in Nuuk is researching how traditional Inuit foodways impact the human gut microbiome Hauptmann s research has shown that traditional Greenlandic foods have increased microbial diversity which could mean better overall health for those who consume them Meet the Thai women reviving ancient recipes in Bangkok Jenson and I stand on the front stoop of Hotel Qaanaaq giggling like two teenagers sneaking a cigarette as she peels open a plastic container She hands me a bird the size of a bagel and instructs me to simply peel the feathers and pull off some meat It comes apart easily and the flavor is a divine revelation The flesh is initially very fruity like ripe plums followed by a long Parmesan cheese finish I was nervous the kiviak would taste like the ammonia flavored hakarl fermented shark of Iceland but I am delighted to encounter meaty piquant notes more reminiscent of Egyptian feseekh fermented gray mullet fish As we both chew in silent delight I wonder how many Arctic traditions like kiviak born of both ingenuity and necessity have already been lost to history At this very moment what textile song recipe ceremony or medicine exists only in the mind of a single elder Indigenous hunting traditions in Greenland Qaanaaq has more Greenlandic sled dogs than people When I walk past a team of dogs they raise their heads in curiosity but don t bark Every year when the sea begins to freeze all the boats are pulled onto land As soon as the sea ice is solid hunters will travel across it via dog sled in search of seals polar bears narwhals walruses and a number of other animals in hopes of feeding their families and sled dogs Hunting in Greenland is strictly regulated following annual quotas issued by the government a process in which input from biologists is officially included In Qaanaaq and the surrounding villages hunters only catch narwhal using the traditional methods of kayak and harpoon Here s where to find narwhals in the Arctic To learn more about traditional food processing and what happens after the hunt Jenson suggests I visit Saki Daorana Her husband has returned from a hunt and she could use your assistance Daorana is a Japanese expat who first visited Greenland in While on a kayaking expedition to Qaanaaq she met local hunter Panigpak and soon after the two were married Twenty five years and three children later she operates Ultima Thule an outfitter that specializes in designing custom trips to remote areas of Greenland Daorana is also happy to help carry on the hunting traditions that permitted her husband s ancestors to survive in one of the world s harshest climates for thousands of years Hunting is central to the Inughuit identity there are some young people here who are very passionate about becoming hunters like their elders Without them this way of life will be gone in a few generations Saki Daorana owner of Ultima Thule I find her atop a raised scaffold holding a large knife Every hunter in town has an ikaaq a free standing wooden platform about the height of a lifeguard s chair where they butcher and preserve meat safely out of the reach of hungry dogs Daorana is squatting amid massive cuts of ruby hued flesh next to a large steel pot The pieces of meat are so large they are more reminiscent of slabs of lumber than something one might find in a butcher shop My husband got a narwhal she says Would you like to help preserve it I am instructed on how to cut the meat in one inch thick slices then dip it into the pot of soy sauce and spices and drape it over the beams of the platform The lean meat will quickly dry out making it a perfect preserved food to help her family survive the upcoming winter Next to the meat is a serving plate of white glistening cubes This is the mattak skin and blubber if you would like to try some Daorana says It is high in vitamin C It is a cornerstone of the traditional diet that prevented ancient Arctic people from getting scurvy The blubber is chewy oily and warming while the skin offers a satisfying crunch Hunting is central to the Inughuit identity Daorana tells me It is not an easy lifestyle She says that not all families are able to survive solely by hunting and gathering anymore and must rely on imported foods from mainland Europe But she says there are some young people here who are very passionate about becoming hunters like their elders Without them this way of life will be gone in a few generations This centuries old British weaving tradition might soon be lost Traditional foraging in Greenland Siorapaluk the only village north of Qaanaaq is also the northernmost Indigenous settlement Its tiny population fluctuates seasonally between and people There are traditions alive in Siorapaluk you will not even find in Qaanaaq Saki Daorana had told me Qaanaaq current population is Greenland s northernmost town Photograph by Cristina Mittermeier Nat Geo Image Collection I arrive on its shores via Captain Argiunnquaq Qaernagag s hunting boat I wander about town passing a few houses with prominently displayed narwhal tusks muskox horns and walrus skulls As I walk past a fisherman cleaning a pile of freshly caught Arctic char he hands me a raw filet as a sign of hospitality The clean pink flesh still has a refreshing taste of oceanic brine As the town is small I soon find myself standing in the tundra It is late August the perfect time to forage for extremophile plants that survive and thrive right up to the icecap The field is freckled with dazzling magenta fireweed flowers I carefully pick a small bouquet to dry out Between the flowers I spot tiny black crowberries I enjoy a handful of the tart sour fruits and quickly realize I am not alone Do you like the taste I look up to see a man who has come out to join my botanical quest He introduces himself as Maassannguaq Oshima and I realize I am plucking my way through his backyard He generously points to a patch of mountain sorrel Try this one he says It is used to make a nice drink You can have it with some glacier ice Here s how urban foraging became the new way to explore a city We continue walking together identifying Arctic plants and discussing their various uses He points out Cladonia alpestris a pale green lichen also known as reindeer lichen as it is the preferred food of reindeer and caribou during winter months A Greenlandic name for that plant is orsuaasat he says You can just cook it like any plant but the old hunters say it is best when it has been partially digested and fermented in the stomach of a caribou That is the old way It is not done as much anymore As we continue exploring the hillside I recall something Saki Daorana had told me This place is certainly not for everyone but if you love it there is no place like it in the world What to know How to get there Most flights to Greenland depart from Copenhagen Denmark There are easy connections to a domestic flight from the hub airport Kangerlussuaq Local flights to Qaanaaq often include an overnight stay in Ilulissat which has restaurants and attractions including boat tours to see the icebergs just outside town There are also flights from Reykjavik Iceland to Ilulissat This is a seasonal route that flies in spring and summer with smaller aircraft Several cruise lines including Silversea offer High Arctic packages that make a stop in Qaanaaq Recommended guides Ultima Thule Whether you re traveling to Northern Greenland on a cultural journey or a scientific expedition Saki Daorana s company can arrange all the details Visit Greenland has information on more outfitters in Qaanaaq Where to stay Hotel Qaanaaq The only hotel in town is currently closed as it changes management Iherit Rent a single room or rent the entire house It includes a kitchen hot water washing machine and wifi Qaanaaq Accommodation Two rooms are available with a nice view of town One room has two twin beds the other has one king size bed What to do In the summer a day is well spent hiking up to the icecap or exploring the sea via a hunter s boat In the spring enjoy riding a dog sled across the sea ice Eqilana Sadorana Simigaq is one of several traditional textile experts living in Qaanaaq She produces and sells clothing including aeqqatit mittens and kamiit boots Among the region s many talented carvers working in bone and horn are Niels Miunge and Pullaq Odaaq in Qaanaaq and Peter Duneq in Siorapaluk Each artist has original works for sale but can also accommodate a custom order Items include necklaces bracelets traditional snow goggles and the small demon like figurines known as tupilaks The Qaanaaq Museum limited hours of operation has a fascinating collection of artifacts from the region including a piece of the Cape York Meteorite you can touch and a traditional hunter s stool made from walrus baculums Justin Fornal is a field researcher specializing in vanishing cultural traditions He is the founder of the
