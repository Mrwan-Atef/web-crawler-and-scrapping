Sainsbury Jan min read Share Long train journeys in Canada are a true delight Read our guide before setting off on your own Shutterstock Train aficionados know that Canada has an extensive rail network and some truly spectacular rides Yet since most Canadians prefer to travel the long distances in this continent size country by car or plane and with most of the rail network devoted to freight service few travel from city to city outside of the eastern corridor hubs of Toronto and MontrÃ al It wasnâ t always so Annual ridership on Canadian trains peaked at million in the â though today only around million annual passengers take the services operated by national carrier VIA Rail Those in search of the glamor of train travel past can seek out more deluxe journeys are run by private companies â including the legendary Rocky Mountaineer a veritable five star hotel on wheels Advertisement If youâ re craving a Canadian rail adventure hereâ s all you need to know Canadian trains are comfortable but slow While passengers praise the overall quality of service on Canadian trains â especially in business or sleeper classes â they should hardly expect bullet train speeds Obligated to yield to freight train operators who make up the bulk of the countryâ s rail traffic passenger trains can spend long periods of time waiting on the sidelines and are often late The fast intercity trains between Toronto Ottawa and MontrÃ al are exceptions zipping along the eastern corridor route in just over five hours VIA Railâ s thrilling Canadian service traverses Canada for a full miles Boxcar Media Shutterstock VIA Rail runs most services The bulk of the rail network is run by VIA Rail with a handful of private companies operating special lines mostly for tourism Several services operated by US company Amtrak shuttle across the international border to Vancouver Toronto and MontrÃ al VIA Rail has two named trains the cross continental Canadian â one of the worldâ s great rail journeys â which links Vancouver and Toronto and the Ocean which carries passengers between MontrÃ al and Halifax in Nova Scotia The corporation also operates five Scenic Adventure lines that cater to both of tourists and rural residents who take advantage of flag stops where the train stops by request only often in the middle of nowhere Outside of VIA Rail various commuter lines operate in the vicinity of Vancouver Toronto and MontrÃ al all logging significantly higher passenger numbers than VIA Rail up to million per year in total Vancouver is served by the West Coast Express Toronto by GO Transit and MontrÃ al by Exo The VIA Rail network doesnâ t extend to Prince Edward Island or Newfoundland and Labrador Nor does it serve the territories â although those who make it to the Yukon might take the privately run White Pass and Yukon Route tourist train that travels in summer between Carcross and Skagway Alaska VIA Rail carriages are generally comfortable with large reclining seats and power outlets even in economy class Long distance overnight trains are particularly spacious passengers also get access to a skyline car with a special dome section for panoramic views Food and drink can be purchased at an on board cafe The veteran Canadian train operator still uses the stainless steel coaches that were first inaugurated in Sleeper Plus class is available on the Canadian the Ocean and Winnipeg â Churchill services Passengers may choose between open berths or one or two bed private compartments Apart from the Winnipegâ Churchill service overnight trains also include access to a special restaurant car offering three meals per day which are included in the price of your ticket A step up from Sleeper Plus is Prestige Sleeper only available on the

trains in Canadaâ s eastern corridor offer either economy or business class The latter includes meals and extra baggage allowance Advertisement Commuters rely on trains in MontrÃ al and Toronto in particular â otherwise riding the rails is a leisurely pursuit in Canada Christopher Oâ Donnell Shutterstock MontrÃ al and Toronto are major rail hubs for commuters While nowhere near as busy as rail networks in Europe the corridor between QuÃ bec City and Windsor draws many passengers particularly between MontrÃ al and Toronto Canadaâ s two largest cities Outside of this trunk Canadians take trains mostly for scenic journeys rather than for their commutes Scenic trains cater mostly to tourists The five Scenic Adventure routes are the Jasperâ Prince Rupert the Skeena in British Columbia the Winnipegâ Churchill in Manitoba the Sudburyâ White River in Ontario and the MontrÃ alâ Senneterre and MontrÃ alâ JonquiÃ re routes in QuÃ bec Many of these routes are sleepy the Jasperâ Prince Rupert line for example attracts just passengers a year Several private companies supplement VIAâ s services The most celebrated is the Rocky Mountaineer whose swank trains run between Vancouver and Banff or Jasper The â First Passage to the Westâ route is the only passenger train that currently runs on the original Canadian Pacific Railway tracks the nationâ s first cross continental railway completed in and passes through the legendary Spiral Tunnels in Yoho National Park Of a similar bent is Royal Canadian Pacific whose trains deliver cruise ship like luxury on multiday excursions Since neither company has sleeper services youâ ll spend the night at hotels across the Rockies instead Ontarioâ s two private routes are the Algoma Central Railway which provides access to the northern Ontario wilderness and the Ontario Northland which operates the Polar Bear Express five times a week The White Pass and Yukon Route between Carcross Yukon and Skagway Alaska dates from and follows the trail once trampled by feverish prospectors en route to the Klondike gold fields Diesel trains pull vintage parlor style carriages The Rocky Mountaineer is a luxury ride between Vancouver and Banff

tickets donâ t cost any more than car rentals Like the USA Canada is a car oriented country â and plenty of Canadians go their whole lives without using an intercity train especially in the West While itâ s easy to rent a car in Canada and enjoy the countryâ s great roads trains emit less carbon per person of compared with for a car and are marginally quicker on the fast intercity routes along the eastern corridor Once you factor in the cost of fuel a car rental is about the same price as a train ticket Most urban train stations in big cities are close to the downtown cores with good onward transport connections Additionally most large stations have a car rental desk While the pace aboard most long distance trains in Canada is slow the amenities are rather lovely Pete Seaward for Lonely
