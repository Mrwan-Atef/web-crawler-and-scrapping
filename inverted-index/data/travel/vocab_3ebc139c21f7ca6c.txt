Real Royal Theatre in the Plaza de Oriente Madrid Efired Shutterstock So youâ re thinking about visiting Madrid Youâ ve made an excellent choice Spain â s capital is an extremely friendly destination that happily accommodates tourists while still retaining its unique identity Duck down any side street away from the souvenir stalls selling magnets and flammable flamenco frocks and youâ ll discover pretty little squares dusty year old artisanal shops and the somber doors of cloistered convents Although Iâ ve been living here for years I continue to be surprised by the city which though small seems to contain infinities Itâ s particularly magical at sunset when residents come out in force to walk their dogs nip into the shops or have a caÃ a â a small chilled glass of beer with a good head of foam Advertisement While other cities might feel frenetic MadrileÃ os always take life at their own pace This is particularly important to bear in mind when youâ re waiting to order a drink Service is invariably slow yet delivered with a winning smile Still itâ s nice to feel that in the heart of a busy metropolis nobody is rushing things Here s everything you need to know ahead of your trip to Madrid You need at least two days in Madrid Madrid is a compact walkable city but youâ ll still need at least two or three days to get a proper handle on it If you want to add in day trips to nearby Toledo Segovia and Cuenca give yourself at least a week Dining alfresco in the summer in Madrid fotoVoyager Getty Images Pack for all seasons Outside of summer Madridâ s weather is notoriously changeable This is particularly true in fall and spring when you might find yourself in shorts and a T shirt only to start shivering when the sun sets In terms of style anything goes Spaniards are easygoing about fashion though they will have a good laugh at your expense if they spot you wearing short sleeves in winter Men should be aware that going topless in the city is frowned upon even in the hottest months Bring some earplugs Madrid is unapologetically noisy conversations in bars are loud and dramatic train carriages buzz to the beat of tinny speakers and on weekends citizens party way into the wee hours The best way to cope is to bring earplugs and make sure you book a room facing away from busy roads Check reviews to ensure your hotel isnâ t right next to a bar That being said night owls will have a blast Know how to get into the city While the metro is the best way to get around town itâ s not necessarily the best way to get in especially if you have a lot of luggage From Madrid airport s Terminal you can catch the Cercanias train to Atocha via ChamartÃ n and Nuevos Ministerios From and look out for the bus that takes you to Atocha This will save you a long walk to the metro station A taxi from the airport to the city center costs a fixed â US rate Advertisement People walking through Madrid s Plaza Mayor BlackFarm Shutterstock Explore on foot Madridâ s metro is efficient clean and cheap However you can walk to most places within the center Itâ s a great way to get to know the city and youâ ll find Spaniards more than happy to point you in the right direction Unfortunately many are so keen to show off their local knowledge that they might confidently give you incorrect information when unsure If you spot a flicker of hesitation take what they say with a pinch of salt Tipping is not expected Tipping is not the norm for most Spaniards though some like to leave a euro or two Understandably this means that waiters donâ t go the extra mile to please If you are happy with the service donâ t be afraid to tip generously When paying by card you can ask taxi drivers and waiters to add the tip to the bill Madrid is a child friendly city Bring the kids Restaurant owners go out of their way to accommodate children and youâ ll often be offered a high chair if you come with a toddler in tow You can also find playgrounds scattered around the city beside bars with outdoor seating where parents can have a grown up drink while keeping an eye on their kids Plaza de la Luna is particularly good for this Madrid s Egyptian Templo de Debod RadKha Shutterstock Kids and pets will get a lot of friendly attention Spaniards love to gush over cute dogs and babies alike So if youâ re traveling with a child or a pooch expect to get a lot of attention Conversely donâ t be afraid to coo over other peopleâ s adorable offspring pets â part of the joy of visiting Madrid is striking up conversations with friendly locals Public intimacy is totally fine MadrileÃ os are really relaxed about PDA and youâ ll often see oblivious young lovers in intimate clinches In the town center gay couples can walk down the street hand in hand and kiss publicly without anyone batting an eyelid Some neighborhoods have been hit hard by tourism Happily Madrid doesnâ t have the same problem with overtourism as Barcelona though you might see angry graffiti railing against tourists in some areas This is especially true in LavapiÃ s which has been particularly badly hit by gentrification If youâ re worried about your impact on the local economy avoid Airbnb English is widely spoken among younger people Generally youâ ll find most businesses are pleased to deal with tourists Don t be offended however if they donâ t respond in English to your questions while younger staff tend to be confident speakers the older generation was not taught the language and can be shy to engage They may well get over their reticence if you have a bash at some basic Spanish Madrid s Tribunal Metro station Leo Marino Shutterstock Take some safety precautions Be wary of pickpockets on the metro opportunistic thefts are common and clueless tourists are a prime target As long as you keep an eye on your valuables you should be fine to walk the city streets at any time of day or night But be extra vigilant on the narrow sloping streets down towards LavapiÃ s near Tirso de Molina metro and the tunnels by Plaza de los Cubos There s been a spate of muggings targeting victims out alone and drunk late at night Lastly watch out for daylight robbery in restaurants and bars Make sure you see a menu before going in Bill padding is the most common scam here and without a price list to check you may find yourself losing out to unscrupulous establishments You can safely drink the tap water The first line of Madridâ s motto is â I was built on water â This is a reference to the abundant underground springs that used to bubble up underfoot These may be long gone but the excellent water pumped in from the nearby mountains is a source of pride to MadrileÃ os To me it tastes much better than the bottled variety Advertisement Advertisement
