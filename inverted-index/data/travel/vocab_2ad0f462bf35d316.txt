visit to St Peter s Basilica with a self guided audio tour St Peter s Basilica is one of the most spectacular churches in the world Although some may confuse it for the mother church of Roman Catholics it isn t even a cathedral because it s not the seat of the pope who is also the bishop of Rome That distinction belongs to the Archbasilica of St John Lateran But because of its size grandeur and location within Vatican City papal authorities use the church for numerous ceremonies Its capacity is enormous it can hold seated worshippers or standing Start your tour with the baldachin the great canopy over the papal altar and St Peter s tomb crafted by master artist and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini The canopy took nine years to build and was completed in It is made of tons of bronze most of it from the portico of Rome s Pantheon It is over feet tall almost as tall as a ten story building St Peter s tomb is directly below it You can see two wings of the ornate balustrade separated by a gate that opens to the sunken semicircular area in front of the papal altar known as the Confessio or Chapel of the Confession This refers to the confession of faith by St Peter which led to his martyrdom The tomb itself is not visible as it is down a set of stairs and tucked into a niche at the back of the Confessio You can only view it on a special tour of the Scavi or excavations in the ancient necropolis Directly above is Michelangelo s dome rising feet to the top of the cross on the lantern tower outside You can see the inner hemispherical layer of its double shell a slightly more pointed one is visible outdoors It is feet in diameter one of the largest domes in the world The colorful mosaics around the dome depict Jesus Mary Joseph St John the Baptist and the Twelve Apostles You can just make out the image of God bestowing his blessing upon mankind through the oculus the round opening at the crown of the dome Around the drum of the dome in blue letters standing almost seven feet tall is the inscription TV ES PETRVS ET SVPER HANC PETRAM AEDIFICABO ECCLESIAM MEAM ET TIBI DABO CLAVES REGNI CAELORVM The biblical citation from Matthew translates as You are Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and to you I will give the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven If you look through the baldachin toward the apse at the end of the central nave you will see the glowing light of the alabaster window depicting the Holy Spirit as a dove the dove is six feet tall Below that is the Altar of the Chair of St Peter a monumental sculpture by Bernini It contains the relics of an ancient chair reputedly from which St Peter preached The altar symbolizes the teaching authority of the pope Immediately behind you you will find the statue of St Peter Enthroned set in front of a maroon and gold mosaic curtain This century bronze sculpture is attributed to Arnolfo di Campio St Peter s hands are raised in the act of blessing and over the course of seven centuries of devotion the custom of kissing or touching the right foot has almost completely worn away the toes Gaze at the boldly patterned marble floor of the nave If you re facing the barricade and row of chairs in the direction of the atrium you ll see a glare on a maroon rectangle That tile shows the keys of heaven a symbol found throughout Vatican City There are also plaques commemorating popes as well as markers that indicate the comparative length of several of the largest churches in the world You can also see a glimpse of what look like lavishly decorated manhole covers for example in front of the rows of chairs These are portals to the tombs of popes below the floor including that of John Paul II who was pope from to All around you are spectacular works of art that look like paintings but aren t They are mosaics made of tiny tiles or tesserae each about the size of a fingernail Mosaics were chosen over paintings to decorate the basilica so that they wouldn t be vulnerable to the ravages of time smoke and humidity eternal art for the eternal church Four marvelous examples are the mosaic medallions that decorate the area between the main cupola of the basilica and the enormous piers underneath These medallions represent the four evangelists who composed the Gospels We can see St Matthew on the left above the baldachin and St John on the right Set into the great piers that support the dome are four colossal marble statues These statues embody crucial moments of Christ s Passion Starting from the right of the altar you see the statue of St Helena mother of Constantine the Great holding the True Cross by Bolgi Continuing clockwise you ll note the statue of St Longinus gripping the sacred lance used to pierce Christ s side by Bernini Continuing toward the right the next statue you see is that of St Andrew Peter s brother representing the moment of his crucifixion in Greece by Duquesnoy And turning back toward the baldachin the
