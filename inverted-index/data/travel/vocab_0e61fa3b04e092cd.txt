Hanuman Dhoka Kathmandu Nepal Attractions Lonely Planet Lonely Planet Destinations Planning Inspiration Shop Search Saves Open main menu UIG via Getty Images Hanuman Dhoka Kathmandu Nepal Asia Top choice in Kathmandu Login Save Kathmandu s royal palace known as the Hanuman Dhoka was originally founded during the Licchavi period to centuries AD but the compound was expanded considerably by King Pratap Malla in the century Sadly the sprawling palace was hit hard by the earthquake and damage was extensive At the time of research the main Nasal Chowk courtyard was open and the Tribhuvan Museum was close to reopening with other buildings closed for reconstruction Even from the outside the palace is impressive Hanuman s assistance to the noble Rama during the exciting events of the Ramayana has led to the monkey god s appearance guarding many important entrances Here cloaked in red and sheltered by an umbrella a Hanuman statue marks the dhoka entrance to the Hanuman Dhoka and has even given the palace its name The statue dates from the god s face has long disappeared under a coating of orange vermillion paste applied by generations of devotees Standards bearing the double triangle flag of Nepal flank the statue while on each side of the palace gate are gaudy stone lions one ridden by Shiva the other by his wife Parvati Above the gate a brightly painted niche is illustrated with a central figure of a ferocious Tantric version of Krishna On the left side is the gentler Hindu Krishna in his traditional blue colour accompanied by two of his gopi milkmaids On the other side are King Pratap Malla and his queen The Hanuman Dhoka originally housed courtyards chowks but the earthquake reduced the palace to today s chowks Nasal Chowk Your main taste of the royal palace will be this handsome courtyard inside the main entrance Nasal Chowk was constructed in the Malla period but many of the buildings around the square are later Rana constructions During the Rana period Nasal Chowk was used for coronations a practice that continued until as recently as with the crowning of King Gyanendra here The former coronation platform stands in the centre of the courtyard while the damaged Basantapur Kathmandu Tower looms over the southern end of the courtyard Beyond the door is the large Narsingha Statue Vishnu in his man lion incarnation in the act of disembowelling a demon The stone image was erected by Pratap Malla in and the inscription on the pedestal explains that he placed it here for fear that he had offended Vishnu by dancing in a Narsingha costume The Kabindrapur Temple in Durbar Sq was built for the same reason Next is the Sisha Baithak Audience Chamber of the Malla kings The open verandah houses the Malla throne and contains portraits of the Shah kings At the northeastern corner of Nasal Chowk stands the damaged Panch Mukhi Hanuman Temple with its five circular roofs Each of the valley towns has a five storey temple although it is the great Nyatapola Temple of Bhaktapur that is by far the best known Hanuman is worshipped in the temple in Kathmandu but only the priests may enter In Nepali nasal means dancing one and Nasal Chowk takes its name from the Dancing Shiva statue hidden in the whitewashed chamber on the northeastern side of the square On display along the east side of the courtyard are the palanquins used to carry Queen Aishwarya during her wedding to Birendra in and later to transport her body to her cremation in Also displayed here is the royal throne Tribhuvan Museum The palace wing to the west of Nasal Chowk overlooking the main Durbar Sq area was constructed by the Ranas in the middle to late part of the century after they wrested power from the royal Shah dynasty Ironically it later became a museum celebrating King Tribhuvan r and his successful revolt against their regime along with memorials to Kings Mahendra r and Birendra r Sadly this wing of the palace bore the brunt of the damage in the earthquake The museum was due to open in though it is unclear at this stage whether such unusual treasures as the king s favourite stuffed bird and his Land Rover with the scars of an attempted assassination survived the disaster Rising above the museum is the nine storey Basantapur Kathmandu Tower which once stood like a beacon at the end of Freak St Unfortunately the upper tiers collapsed during the earthquake and the tower is closed to visitors while it is repaired with Chinese assistance Lohan Chowk Mul Chowk These two courtyards are currently under renovation but should eventually reopen The first square you reach after the Tribhuvan Museum is Lohan Chowk This courtyard was formerly ringed by four red coloured towers constructed by King Prithvi Narayan Shah representing the

with a two storey building surrounding the courtyard Mul Chowk is dedicated to Taleju Bhawani the royal goddess of the Mallas and sacrifices are made to her in the centre of the courtyard during the Dasain festival Non Hindus are not allowed in the square but you can get views from the doorway in the northeastern corner of Nasal Chowk Mohankali Chowk Sundari Chowk On the northern side of Nasal Chowk a beautifully carved doorway leads to the Malla kings private quarters which rank as the oldest parts of Hanuman Dhoka This area was also damaged and reconstruction may take some years Until then both courtyards remain closed The first courtyard is Mohankali Mohan Chowk which dates from At one time a Malla king had to be born here to be eligible to wear the crown The last Malla king Jaya Prakash Malla had great difficulties during his reign even though he was the legitimate heir because he was born elsewhere Impressive wood carvings line the wall alcoves many of them depicting the exploits of young Krishna and the central hiti water reservoir is the palace s finest Pride of place in the intimate black and white Sundari Chowk behind is the ritual bathing pool with its Lichhavi era carving of Krishna subduing the coils of the Kaliya serpent hewn from a single block of stone in the century The Malla kings would ritually bathe each morning at the golden waterspout whose waters
