always something new to dive into National Geographic photographer Michael George heads across Ontario meeting some adventurers and artisans inspired by the province s abundance of water Video by National Geographic CreativeWorks By Michael George September Destination Ontario would like to acknowledge that Ontario is the world in one province and is the original homelands to many nations of the First Peoples With the Cree Nation in the North the Haudenosaunee in the South and the Anishinabek Nation all around the Great Lakes Destination Ontario is pleased to acknowledge and support the First Peoples and First Nations of these lands the Inuit and the Metis as we host visitors together Ontario Canada holds many impressive stats including the largest city in Canada over cultural groups and almost million people One of the most impressive facts is that the province has over lakes Cue head exploding emoji I grew up near the coast and have always been drawn to water as a chance to rejuvenate When I learned that water is so entwined in the province it felt like a requirement to find every possible way to explore it In search of the kind of renewal only travel provides I set off to drive across the province learning about Ontario through its endless pools of blue As a photographer and writer I find a place is best discovered through its people and they will be my entry point starting with a fourth generation farmer As the sun sets the evening light ignites a rainbow over Niagara Falls Nestled at the end is not a pot of gold but Niagara City Cruises taking visitors on a journey into the mist Photograph by Michael George Visitors to the Niagara Parks Power Station can take an elevator from the main atrium down to this foot long tunnel that leads to a unique view of the base of the falls Photograph by Michael George N iagara Passing through the urban areas surrounding Niagara Falls I am surprised to find how quickly they give way to orchards as far as the eye can see Arnie Lepp has close ties to these orchards and recently founded Spirit in Niagara Small Batch Distillery in Niagara on the Lake After selling produce for decades Arnie came up with a remarkably simple idea to reduce waste turn it into delicious eau de vie One of his unique creations a plumoncello the yellow plum cousin to limoncello just won a gold medal at the Bartender Spirits Awards The health of his orchards is all thanks to the lake effect weather that creates a mild winter and allows the trees to survive Without the lake we wouldn t be here says Arnie My glossary of water now includes this hidden power Arnie Lepp founder of The Spirit in Niagara Distillery inspects one of the many peach trees in his orchard To reduce waste and increase sustainability the distillery uses fruit that would otherwise be discarded to make a variety of spirits Photograph by Michael George Top Left and Photograph by Michael George Bottom Right Though there s one place nearby where water s raw power is not hidden it s the whole display Everyone visits Niagara for the falls but there s a manmade wonder right next door that is just as impressive The Niagara Parks Power Station is a hydroelectric power plant which started operating in ran for nearly a century and is now run by the Niagara Parks Commission as a cavernous attraction The generator hall is open both day and night featuring interactive exhibits and an elaborate light show that educates through entertainment I take an elevator feet below ground into a tunnel that provides an up close perspective on Horseshoe Falls This tunnel used to release all the water back into the Niagara River after it was finished turning turbines and creating energy Now it delivers visitors into the mist where there is more often than not a rainbow stretching into the sky Southampton Sauble Beach Next up I head north to Southampton to meet local Indigenous artist Emily Kewageshig Emily is Anishnaabe and her work explores the interconnection of life forms often using the aesthetic of fluidity to show how water connects us all Walking Lake Huron she looks out Water is life we come from the water and every life form needs it to survive As we move along the main drag of Sauble Beach she points out some local landmarks such as the nostalgic and photogenic Sauble Beach sign before we return to her studio down the road Her paintings are like jewels that pop off the clean white walls Each one draws you in and forces your eye to trace the composition through the many flowing lines Observing them feels like meditating and I understand how her calm connection to the lake nearby feeds these compositions Emily Kewageshig an Indigenous artist and visual storyteller from Saugeen First Nation No poses in her studio with a painting she made that s inspired by my journey through Ontario Canada Photograph by Michael George Aerial views of Southampton one of many charming coastal towns that line Lake Huron Photograph by Michael George Parry Sound Killbear Provincial Park Another local I meet on my route who knows these waterways intimately is Tori Baird an intrepid explorer and founder of Paddle Like a Girl After a few simple instructions I slip into my very own canoe and begin gliding across the surface of the Magnetawan River near Parry Sound We pass heaps of flowering lilies lush pine forests and an abundance of wildlife Tori Baird heads toward a small island in the Magnetawan River near Parry Sound Tori is the founder of Paddle Like a Girl an inclusive canoeing and outdoor workshop that helps people discover the peace and beauty that mother nature has to offer Photograph by Michael George Tori Baird stands with a custom made paddle next to her canoe along the Magnetawan River Photograph by Michael George I ask Tori about her connection to this river trying my best to keep pace alongside her When you re out here you re free Eating lunch on an uninhabited island all on your own One waterway leads to another and you can escape for multiple days It s good for your body mind and spirit she says While it would be impossible to check off bodies of water Tori is well on her way traveling through remote wilderness areas and knowing every bend of this river She sees canoeing as a way to empower women and give them a sense of freedom from their daily responsibilities After a few hours of paddling I realize as we return to the shore that although I have been surrounded by it on all sides I haven t drunk any water It is an unusually hot day and I rummage through my backpack to find my canteen still cold from the shade of my seat and take a sip After paddling the taste is invigorating refreshing and of course hydrating Water has power in all forms from these small sips bringing me back to life to the massive river steadily flowing by us Though I could spend all day on these shores Tori suggests I continue my water adventure at another location not far from the Magnetawan River Killbear Provincial Park has over miles of coastline made up of rolling rock formations that make water access easy The park occupies an entire peninsula jutting into Georgian Bay No matter where I am a rocky shoreline or sandy beach is not far away Walking out under the sparkling midday sun I catalog more water activities than I can count To my left are families kayaking paddleboarding and swimming To my right are jet skis boats and a line of thrill seekers jumping into the water Killbear is large enough that everyone can make their own space and find seclusion if wanted This natural escape is not far from the self proclaimed jewel of the Islands Parry Sound Tourism Islands Georgian Bay A UNESCO World Heritage SiteParry Sound Tourism Whitby I ve spent a lot of time exploring water in its liquid form but it s time to expand my imagination and see what healing powers can be found when it evaporates Thermëa spa village in Whitby follows the classic Nordic approach of hot cold rest For the former it has many saunas including Hälo a warm rose colored respite with a vaulted ceiling made of pure Himalayan salt blocks In a special steam room their ritual artisans like Robin Pacquina walk visitors through a self guided Rhassoul treatment Robin poetically describes the experience The word itself derives from the Moroccan for washing and cleansing Walking into the room the steam is so thick it s like stepping into a cloud allowing an isolated experience among others We usea scrub with royal jelly a substance produced by honeybees strictly for the queen Hot water falls from above washing it away as we begin the next step a clay mask and body rub followed by argan oil moisturizer I didn t even receive the treatment and I feel refreshed Looking out on the vast property with its seemingly endless hot and cold pools relaxed visitors walking by in their robes it feels like an ultra zen college campus I am eager to enroll for a full semester but I must continue onward to Prince Edward County Entering the Hälo Sauna at Thermëa spa village in Whitby visitors are greeted by a vaulted ceiling made of pure Himalayan salt blocks Photograph by Michael George Prince Edward County Often referred to as simply The County this part of Ontario is a bucolic picture postcard landscape filled with picturesque farms heritage houses and lake views that can be seen directly from the road Happily the locals don t take for granted the value and beauty of this land and are eager to share its bounty I drive by Prince Edward County Lavender Farm and the scent in the air puts me in the right headspace for the next stage of my travels You might find a view worthy of a postcard around every corner when driving through Prince Edward County Often referred to as The County this is a picturesque region of farmhouses and friendly communities that sits on a headland that juts into Lake Ontario Photograph by Michael George At Stella s Eatery head chef Leah changes the menu every day to reflect the latest offerings from nearby farms The dishes are unique artful and taste like they should cost twice as much I arrive before the dinner rush to meet co owner Cristina Meillon and as it gets busier the atmosphere is like my most unpretentious and effortlessly cool friend inviting me to a party with an immaculate vibe The tomato toast combines fresh heirloom tomatoes with a whipped feta that is so fluffy it looks animated Other standouts are the country fried rabbit and seared pickerel both incorporating flavors that are simultaneously light fresh and incisive The only thing that could tear me away from these unique tastes is the promise of an epic sunset Cristina understands and describes to me the view from Slake Brewing An assortment of farm to table dishes from Stella s Eatery including some of the chef s favorites like tomato toast and seared pickerel Photograph by Michael George Pulling into the parking lot her words come to life when I see the building positioned atop a limestone hill The outside garden and large windows show off a panoramic view of the undulating landscape Greg one of Slake Brewing s three owners meets me at an outdoor picnic table and explains how they truck in water from Lake Ontario to brew the beer Sipping on a sharp IPA with the bright orange sun kissing the horizon I discover yet another wonder of water Slake Brewing uses a full cycle process with spent grains distributed to the animals of nearby farms Each of its beer names has a story to tell the best of which is Darren The One Eyed Cat For now I ll leave that tale a mystery as I am long overdue some shut eye At the Drake Devonshire a nightly campfire along Lake Ontario allows guests to gather to enjoy conversation and the reflection of the moonlight Photograph by Michael George Heading south I find the ideal place to rest in The Drake Devonshire a boutique hotel on the shores of Lake Ontario with a small creek that runs directly through the property The interior spaces have a one of a kind character somehow finding a balance between feeling modern yet echoing the past Sculptures and small artworks fill every corner while the hotel s latest addition is a pickleball court I fall asleep staring up at my skylight watching as raindrops carry me to dreamland You May Also Like TRAVEL Ontario

ve explored at least half of the province s bodies of water each one with its own unique offerings Driving into Toronto I seek a respite to process everything I ve seen After a minute ferry ride I step out onto Ward s Island part of the Toronto Islands Carved with estuaries filled with beavers herons and boathouses it feels much more remote than it is My last and probably most memorable experience on the water is a combination of yoga and stand up paddleboarding Toronto Islands SUP provides classes that really test my connection to the water like balancing on a board in downward dog pose After a short paddle the Toronto city skyline comes into view with hazy clouds floating above Though the CN Tower has an iconic silhouette the vast reflective water in the foreground helps it shine Our instructor suggests a pose and to achieve it I must connect with the gentle rhythm of the waves For yoga with a first class view Toronto Island SUP offers guided tours or classes at sunset just as I experienced here with the Toronto skyline as my backdrop Photograph by Michael George My hope for this trip was to understand Ontario through my favorite element Despite traveling the world I ve never found this many ways to indulge my senses through water My instructor guides my attention to my breath and I notice how the slow swell of the waves also feels like breathing As if the entire lake is alive I ve repeated Emily s words like a mantra since I left Southampton Water is life Seeing the glint of gold on the cadenced ripples flowing out from our boards this has never felt truer My movements slowly sync with the waves and I find balance thinking back on all the vibrant personalities rich cultures and unique crafters that brought me to this moment You May Also Like
