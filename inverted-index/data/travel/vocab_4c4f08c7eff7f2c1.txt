The author and her nephew take in the city from one of Lisbon s top viewpoints Miradouro da Senhora do Monte Â Brekke Fletcher Lonely Planet Lonely Planet editor Brekke Fletcher recently traveled to Lisbon Portugal Here she shares some tips and insights for anyone planning a similar trip We landed in Lisbon a Friday for an April weekend jaunt to discover temperatures well above It was HOT My nephew Fletcher had flown in from London where he is studying and I came from Dublin where I was attending a work conference Since he had never been to Lisbon and I love to eat our itinerary was chock a block with sites and tastes Advertisement I haven t been to Lisbon since and all I can say is the word is out It was so much more crowded than I remember I mean absolutely jammed and this is shoulder season The summer like temperatures might have been to blame but there were lines everywhere reservations were necessary except at the sublime and legendary Gabrinus where I walked in on Sunday night and ate at the bar If you re looking for hidden or under the radar experiences this itinerary is not for you but it is pretty perfect for a first timer The scene at SEEN the rooftop restaurant at the at the Tivoli Avenida Liberdade Lisboa Â Minor Hotels Where did you stay What was the vibe Our hotel was on Avenida da Liberdade Lisbon s main thoroughfare and the only straight flat boulevard in town Here s where you find all the big name designers from Gucci to Louis Vuitton as well as many fancy hotels designer boutiques and upscale restaurants We stayed at Hotel Avani Avenida Liberdade Lisbon which shares amenities an outdoor pool and an Anantara spa with its ritzier next door neighbor the Tivoli Avenida Liberdade Lisboa It was like getting two hotels for the price of one After checking into our lovely room at Avani we made our way next door to have a snack in the Tivoli lobby before checking in for our pre arranged massages at the Anantara Spa The experience was so relaxing and satisfying we both nearly fell asleep during our treatments â and we weren t even jet lagged Re energized we put on our party clothes The octopus carpaccio at SEEN restaurant was delicious Â Brekke Fletcher Lonely Planet Advertisement The hotel set us up with reservations at the Tivoli s rooftop restaurant SEEN which was a scene On a Friday night the places was pumping with a DJ spinning a great remix of tunes George Michael Madonna and the adjacent outdoor Skybar with incredible views of Lisbon s tiled rooftops and the Tagus river in the distance was packed with revelers We ate some incredible octopus carpaccio top notch sushi had a few drinks including the best Moscow Mule I ve ever tasted and enjoyed the party atmosphere What was the most touristy thing you did Let me be frank we pretty much did only touristy things Since this was Fletcher s first trip to Lisbon he had a list of must see landmarks including the Torre de BelÃ m the Mosteiro dos and the Castelo de SÃ o Jorge Our tourist highlights included visiting the Torre de BelÃ m and the tomb of Vasco da Gama at Monastery Â Brekke Fletcher Lonely Planet Since there s a ticket cost to visiting all of these sites we decided to invest in two hour Lisboa Cards For â per person the Lisboa Card provides access to all these locales and many more along with public transportation to get you hither and thither Worth its weight in gold we were able to skip long lines to get in everywhere except the Monastery where the line to enter the cloisters was at least people deep The adjacent church officially named Igreja de Santa Maria de BelÃ m was easily accessed and extraordinarily beautiful with the sun shining through stained glass windows What is the best thing you ate or drank The steak at Restaurante Brilhante was sublime The texture the flavor the sauce Savory yet not too salty melt in your mouth As described on the menu A tribute to the century old Lisbon recipe for Bife Ã Marrare a speciality immortalized by the famous cafÃ s of the century We have perfected the recipe which will remain a well kept secret I detected butter shallots cream but yeah I couldn t recreate it The dessert was a classic chocolate soufflÃ order it early because it takes minutes to prepare served with hazelnuts and ice cream Restaurante Brilhante in Lisbon served a delectable steak and soufflÃ Â Brekke Fletcher Lonely Planet I also want to shout out the charming local chain Dear Breakfast with outposts in Alfama where we ate Bica Chiado and Santos Like Lisbon writ large it gives off laid back dreamy California vibes It even has breakfast tacos on the menu which I highly recommend alongside the divine pastries and a squishy banana bread Banana covered banana bread at Dear Breakfast a mirror selfie at bar PavilhÃ o ChinÃªs Â Brekke Fletcher Lonely Planet What was the most under the radar activity you enjoyed Not quite sure it s under the radar but since you have to ring a bell to get in I m saying it is PavilhÃ o ChinÃªs is a bar has been on my list for ages and I knew my nephew would get a kick out of how kitschy and random it is Think shelves up on shelves of figurines in glass cabinets lining the walls red carpeting dark lighting and overpriced everything But who cares For a post dinner drink it was a great show Was it the best cocktail ever Probably not All the Ts a TukTuk tour tiles and a tram in the Alfama district of Lisbon Â Brekke Fletcher Lonely Planet Favorite activity from the trip So last time I was in Lisbon trudging through Alfama on foot in the scorching heat I watched people in passing TukTuks looking much happier and a lot less winded than I This time especially with the heat I booked a minute Old Lisbon ride with electric Eco Tuk Tours Our guide driver Bruno shared so much good info with us answered all our questions about Lisbon s history and shared a lot of insights on the way the earthquake of still impacts the city today He showed us Roman ruins and vistas stopped to let me admire some tiles and expertly navigated the narrow streets dodging bikers trams pedestrians with aplomb I would be remiss if I didn t mention that I spent my final daylight hours basking in the sun by the pool at Tivoli drinking white Portuguese wine watching people dip in and out of the water When you re bone tired from exploring is there anything better than lounging at a hotel pool NÃ o Brekke Fletcher and her nephew were guests of the Avani and Tivoli hotels in Lisbon Lonely Planet does not accept freebies in exchange for positive coverage
