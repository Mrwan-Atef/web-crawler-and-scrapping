An overnight adventure travelling from Sofia to Istanbul by train Ortaköy Mosque is just one of the unmissable Istanbul sights at the end of this trip Photograph by Jon Arnold AWL Images TRAVEL An overnight adventure travelling from Sofia to Istanbul by train The overnight train from the Bulgarian capital to the Turkish city that straddles the Bosphorus is a fitting final leg on a trans European rail trip By Monisha Rajesh August min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK No dining car says Vasil vaping through a cloud that smells of strawberries A paralegal from Plovdiv he s been eavesdropping on my chat with the barman at One More Bar in Sofia about the sleeper service to Istanbul the last leg of a journey that had begun several days earlier at London s St Pancras station My shoulders drop the dining car is the beating heart of a night train It s where strangers become friends food tells a story and the air is thick with soupy aromas and laughter Go right and walk up to Izbata it s real traditional Bulgarian food he says kissing his fingertips Leaving the din of the cocktail den my friend Jamie and I wander around the corner and find a pink building with a basement entrance leading to a tavern with stone walls and wooden tables After a long day trudging between musty onion domed cathedrals secondhand book stalls and flea markets selling military medals hot stew is what I need to set me up for the hour ride to Turkey Chef s kiss indeed the menu is a riot of meat on meat Spicy sudjuk sausage arrives curved around fried dill potatoes and raw red onion followed by an earthenware pot of kapama silky slivers of veal pork and chicken in rice sealed by a crisp doughy lid Rich and filling it beats anything I d find in a European dining car Half an hour before the departure we lurk on the platform among passengers carrying bottled water breadsticks and children The Sofia Istanbul Express groans into the station on each window a crescent and star the symbol of the Ottoman Empire Hands are clasped to loved ones faces tears quietly wiped with sleeves and bags heaved up the steps Passengers glance into one another s compartments to gauge which ones look best Turkish house music starts in the one next door to mine and I peek in expecting to find a group of students but discover a family of four loading up their fridge with energy drinks Our twin compartment has made up berths sealed bags of ironed linen fat pillows and a fridge stocked with water apple juice pretzel sticks and hazelnut Hobby chocolate bars By the time we sail away from the platform Jamie s set up Netflix on a MacBook hotspotting off his phone It feels like a sleepover film on Pringles popped open and socked feet tucked under blankets But I can t turn away from the window hands cupped to the glass for a better view as the outskirts of the Bulgarian capital pass in the creeping darkness Apartments loom by the track revealing families at kitchen tables flashing TV screens and smokers standing in the shadows on balconies As the train breaks into a canter fields and farms whip by a flash of silver from a river winding alongside Then there s nothing but blackness and the thump of trance from next door On a final toilet trip before bed I chat to Grace and Alex from Munich who have made a no fly pact for a year and Murat a construction site manager from Istanbul Having found work in Romania two years previously he s on his biannual journey home Normally I fly home but this time I thought it will be good to try the journey by train he says Kicking off my hotel slippers I clamber up to bed the steady drum of the wheels soothing now that the music has stopped I know I m in for fitful sleep as we re due a passport check at at the Bulgarian border town of Svilengrad and then a schlep off the train to scan bags at the Turkish border crossing of Kapikule A tremendous thud brings us to a halt and I ease back the curtain to see barbed wire looping along a low lit wall Footsteps approach Kapikule border guards knock and ask for passports No one knows where to go when we disembark passengers lighting up cigarettes and milling around station cats curling around our legs The staff here have turned doing nothing into an art form and it s half an hour before a blind goes up and tired flopping children wearing Disney backpacks are ferried to the front of the queue with their parents I could have an arsenal in my backpack so oblivious is the guard who ignores the bags passing along the conveyor belt before the train lets out a comical pair of toots and we stumble back on and into bed It s warm and quiet on board We sleep deeply but an internal alarm stirs me at dawn and I slip outside the compartment in time to see an indigo sky cracking open over Lake Küçükçekmece an orange glow shimmering on its surface Istanbul s hills roll into view as do minarets sharp like pencil points and mosque domes soft edged in the fading darkness The city is already stirring lights flicking on in buildings cars reversing down drives A fingernail of moon sits in the corner of the sky As we glide to a halt I feel a burning sense of achievement to have reached this far overland For the final time I step down off the train ambling up the platform at Halkali station as the morning call to prayer
