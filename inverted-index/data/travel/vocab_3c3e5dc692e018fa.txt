Explore the wilder side of Venice with the help of its fishermen TRAVEL Explore the wilder side of Venice with the help of its fishermen Overtourism is threatening life on Burano a bucolic island in the Venice Lagoon Can new ecotourism efforts turn things around A boat travels through a natural salt marsh in the Venice Lagoon Local fishermen are now taking tourists around these waters surrounding Italy s floating city showing them wildlife and their fragile way of life By Julia Buckley Photographs by Marco Zorzanello January min read Fly into Venice in fall or spring and you may spot huge circles and strange swirls spreading across the waters below These are the nets of moecanti fishermen who catch moeche the Venice Lagoon s softshell crabs For centuries they ve staked out the crustaceans in this wilder corner of Italy s floating city Few outsiders imagine Venice as bucolic Instead it s synonymous with overtourism every year around million visitors swarm into a place of under residents The Venetian population has shrunk by percent in the past years its residents driven out by ballooning rents and cuts in services In a bid to stem the flow this summer Venetian authorities will begin charging day trippers a fee of three to euros Zoom in to see other places mentioned in this story The smaller islands of the lagoon will be exempt from the new tax yet overtourism threatens them too Burano a one square mile island in the north lagoon draws thousands of visitors daily They take a minute vaporetto waterbus ride from Venice to see the island s candy colored cottages and tipsy leaning bell tower The tourists pack the narrow canal side walkways and leave chaos and trash in their wake The island of Burano about a minute boat ride from Venice has been a fishing center since medieval times Legends say that the houses of Burano were painted different bright colors so fishermen could find their way home in the fog Photograph by Julien Jaulin Hans Lucas Redux Now some Buranelli as residents are called are fighting back making the island a launching ground for ecotourism A clutch of the island s fishermen are doubling up on their jobs casting their nets as well as showing tourists the fragile lagoon and why it needs preserving A centuries old fishing tradition Life on Burano has always revolved around the water A fishing settlement since medieval times with a history dating back to the Roman era the island s relative separation from Venice has kept its traditions intact Yet working with tourists is increasingly important for the fishermen s livelihoods Wholesale seafood prices nearly halved during the pandemic and while they recovered they plummeted again in late Businesses bought farmed fish from other countries says Andrea Rossi a fifth generation Burano fisherman who also takes travelers out on his boat That s intolerable lagoon fish should be valued Need to complain Here s how medieval Venetians did it Domenico Rossi no relation to Andrea another moecante also brings visitors on half day trips from Burano He sails his bright red and green bragozzo a traditional trawler boat out into the emerald waters showcasing both his way of life and the wildlife of the lagoon I m proud of my work but I m also aware that in a few years there won t be anyone left doing it he says For centuries fishermen like him have cast their nets across the lagoon twice a year from March to June and October to December Domenico s family has fished since the times of La Serenissima the Venetian Republic but the tradition stops with him Numbers of both crabs and fishermen are sharply declining When I was a child there were moecanti on Burano now we are he says Climate change has raised lagoon temperatures over the last decade and while the crabs aren t endangered yet fewer of them are swimming into fishermen s nets Fishermen Christian De Antoni and Andrea Doria pick crabs from their nets in the Venice Lagoon A fisherman checks to see if his crabs have shed their outer shells Freshly caught moeche crabs spill out of a net The delicacy supports a small group of fishermen who live on small islands in the Venetian Lagoon The potential loss of his traditional industry spurred him to start offering tours I love my work and I want something to remain he says Nobody has ever bothered to explain or show this work So Domenico meets guests at the century fishermen s cooperative on Burano and zips them away into the lagoon slipping through narrow channels where the water is just inches deep and the larger tourist boats that sail day trippers around cannot pass If it s crab season passengers might see his nets laid out in three half mile zigzags hand stitched to chestnut poles He then sails passengers to Torcello the island opposite Burano famous for its basilica filled with glittering Byzantine mosaics This is where Venice started in the early medieval period as Burano developed on fishing Torcello became a boomtown port of inhabitants Tourists visit the church of Santa Caterina on the island of Mazzorbo in the Venice Lagoon Mazzorbo is tethered to Burano by a pedestrian bridge Today only a dozen locals remain in Torcello the fields encircling the basilica are now fallow and most other historic buildings have fallen into ruin Near the church is Domenico s cabin where he sorts the crabs that have swum into his nets Moeche are eaten only as softshells meaning he must throw about percent of his catch back into the lagoon The small percentage of crabs that are about to molt go into crates in the canal adjacent to his cabin where Domenico checks on them twice a day ready to whisk them to market as soon as they shed their outer shells Burano is a happy island he says We have an invasion of tourists but they do bring work I m only against a certain type of tourism Coming here for minutes doesn t make any sense Andrea Rossi agrees We need a better kind of tourism he says Not people coming en masse to buy souvenirs and destroy the island We re a very small very particular place We paint our houses different colors roast fish outside our homes and we fish in the lagoon I m proud but I m also afraid this will disappear A capitèllo or shrine dedicated to the Madonna is located on a sandbank in the Venice Lagoon Andrea supplies seafood for some of Venice s top restaurants and has now branched out into ecotourism Along with his fishing partner Michele Vitturi he takes visitors birdwatching on Torcello and on sailing trips into the wild north lagoon I want to allow tourists to discover what s behind the famous sights he says They come to Venice but they don t see the lagoon I show them the tranquillity the plants the wildlife the peace beyond the chaos Another Venice It is says Andrea as he and Vitturi sail their little fishing boat due north from Burano another lagoon another Venice The boat slips past islands abandoned centuries ago and alongside barene the mudflats which form the backbone of the lagoon A pair of sickle beaked ibises swoops overhead as a kestrel darts towards Torcello Further north flamingos stalk through the shallow grey green water There are small islands in the Venice Lagoon including Madonna del Monte with its ruins of an century church Many of the islands have been abandoned due to rising seas On the trip back to Burano Vitturi cuts the engine and paddles towards bushy plants samphire and santonico a kind of lagoon absinthe snipping off the tips for passengers to sniff Some days he harvests cuttings to sell to Venice restaurants along with their crabs Among the restaurants the duo supplies is Michelin starred Venissa on the island of Mazzorbo which connects to Burano via a pedestrian bridge Venissa has an onsite vineyard and an organic vegetable garden tended to by island retirees Their moeche also show up on the menu at Burano s Trattoria al Gatto Nero beloved by Hollywood A listers and residents For six decades the Bovo family that owns it has been buying direct from Buranelli fishermen We try to keep it as traditional as possible says maître d Massimiliano Bovo We like giving clients traditional fish traditional people in a real Burano atmosphere The menu stars lagoon specialities goby fish risotto seared scallops and razor clams and in season moeche fried and eaten whole the better to show off their salty sweet taste The lagoon must be defended at all costs we have to make the effort to preserve it now says Massimiliano Luckily the fishermen are on the case Book a trip with Andrea Rossi at
