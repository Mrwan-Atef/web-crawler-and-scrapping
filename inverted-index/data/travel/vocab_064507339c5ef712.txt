routes to hilltop climbs Portugal has trails to suit every type of hiker Â Getty Images Though rightly famed for its golden beaches and picturesque cities Portugal is less well known for its hiking paths This is good news for those in search of incredible trails without the crowds to match This Iberian nation is packed with countless scenic routes from clifftop journeys overlooking the crashing waves to craggy mountain trails in well preserved parks and nature preserves Hiking here is not only about enjoying panoramic views and spotting wildlife stepping onto the trail can also take you back in time to traditional stone villages and along ancient routes once used by the Romans In general the best time to hike is in the spring and fall although if youâ re heading south the winter doesnâ t disappoint Youâ ll have cool but mostly pleasant days and enjoy a welcome lack of crowds wherever you go Here are seven of our favorite hikes in Portugal Advertisement Hike up to peak the highest point in the Algarve Â EunikaSopotnicka Getty Images Via Algarviana Best long distance hike in the southern interior miles weeks moderate If youâ ve had enough of lounging on one of the Algarveâ s postcard pretty beaches a hike along part â or if youâ re really brave all â of the long Via Algarviana is the best way to appreciate the magnificent landscapes of this region The trail stretches from Alcoutim in the northeast to the Cabo de SÃ o Vicente in the southwest Some of the most beautiful sections are around Monchique where splendid vistas open up as you climb through cork groves to the Algarve s highest peaks For a two day taster of the trail stay in Monchique walk up to Picota and back one day and up to and back the next Avoid high summer when temperatures can be extreme and wildfires can pose a hazard Seven Hanging Valleys Trail Best walk along sea cliffs miles one way hours moderate The central coast of the Algarve is the starting point for one of the loveliest seaside walks in the Iberian peninsula Multicolored rock formations the scent of the salt tinged air and the sound of crashing waves all set the stage for an immersive hike along coastal cliffs The light is most impressive in the early morning or late in the day but in truth thereâ s no bad time to go Even if you go in the heat of the day you can cool off at beaches along the way or wait until lovely Praia da Marinha at the end of the trail Donâ t miss key photo opportunities like the Alfanzina lighthouse or the wind carved arches jutting into the ocean at Praia da Mesquita The walk also passes over the Benagil Caves but if you want to see the spectacular interior head down to Praia de Benagil where you can arrange a boat trip Hike from the beautiful o village to Foz dâ Ã gua Â Paulo Dias Photography Getty Images o to Foz dâ Ã gua Loop Best village to village walk miles round trip hours moderate Advertisement A trip to the tiny village of o takes you deep into the Serra de AÃ or Goshawk Mountains a remote range of vertiginous ridges deeply cut valleys rivers and virgin woodland The village itself is extremely atmospheric set among steeply terraced slopes with its grey schist houses clinging to the verdant hills but it can get busy with tourists To escape the crowds and enjoy the serenity of this magnificent region take the short signposted trail to the nearby village of Foz dâ Ã gua home to some lovely old stone bridges schist houses and a precarious looking footbridge over the river gorge You can loop back on a different path with magnificent views over the verdant landscape Paiva Walkways Best river walk miles one way hours moderate Hidden in northern Portugalâ s Aveiro region is one of the country s best inland walks The PassadiÃ os do Paiva take you along a series of staircases and walkways that cling to the hillsides overlooking the gurgling Paiva River Enjoy beautiful views over a rugged valley and plenty of opportunities to cool off with three river beaches along the way At the journeyâ s end or beginning you can make an optional visit to Ponte Arouca the worldâ s longest pedestrian suspension bridge Preparation is essential for this walk It s located in the Arouca Geopark and you must have a very reasonably priced ticket to go on the walk Itâ s easiest and cheapest to book this online Youâ ll also need your own vehicle to reach the trailhead since there are no buses here as well as a firm idea of your itinerary You can start in either Areinho or Espiunca and take a taxi back to your starting point at the end If youâ re only planning to go one way however itâ s less strenuous to begin in Areinho If youâ re planning to do a roundtrip hike then you should start in Espiunca and get the harder bits out of the way first Via Geira Roman Road Best historical trail miles one way hours easy One of Parque Nacional da Peneda GerÃªs unforgettable hiking experiences is the Via Geira an ancient Roman road that once stretched nearly miles between Braga and Astorga Spain and now has World Heritage status The most beautiful stretch begins at Portela do Homem where the Roman milepost XXXIV still stands From the milepost you can walk southwest following the Rio Homem downhill through the beautiful Mata de Albergaria forest This entire stretch is littered with Roman trail markers â some inscribed with the name of the emperor during whose rule they were erected Rocha da Pena circuit Best off the beaten path hike miles round trip hours moderate The Serra do CaldeirÃ o s most worthwhile short walk is climbing this limestone escarpment via a well signposted circuit The area has different plant species including native daffodils and bee orchids Among the birdlife you might see are the short toed snake eagle Iberian green woodpecker and Egyptian vulture Donâ t miss the optional detour up to Talefe the highest point in the Rocha da Pena at with mesmerizing views over the Algarveâ s hinterlands Museums in Salir Alte and QuerenÃ a stock a basic map guide Carry water and snacks the only refreshment stops are small shops cafes at the base and in Pena village and heed seasonal forest fire warnings The Rocha da Pena is also popular with rock climbers There is a coastal and an inland trail on the Rota Vicentina Â Vitaly Fedotov Shutterstock Rota Vicentina Best coastal walk in Portugal Fishermenâ s Trail miles Historical Way miles days each trail moderate The Rota Vicentina comprises two walking trails â one coastal and one inland â and runs along the southwest coast to Cabo de SÃ o Vincente The coastal walk better known as the Fishermenâ s Trail uses paths forged by beachgoers and fisherfolk and passes through some of Portugalâ s most dramatic coastal scenery The inland route the Historical Way is equally appealing It passes through rural villages cork tree forests and river valleys with a scenic coastal section anchoring the southern end of the trail Both trails are made up of sections and itâ s rarely more than miles between villages where you can lodge for the night thus no need to bring camping gear The Fishermenâ s Trail has sections totaling miles and the walk is slightly more difficult with some passages on dunes and thigh burning sands At times it runs along the cliffs mostly single track and only walkers are allowed The longer Historical Way has sections totaling miles Trails are wider and the walk is generally easier mountain bikes are permitted Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Portugal Let a local expert craft your
