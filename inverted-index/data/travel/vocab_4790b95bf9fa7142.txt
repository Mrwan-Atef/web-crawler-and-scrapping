around and you ll reach the summit s glorious views by sunrise Emma Tyers Getty Images With such a variety of landscapes from iconic paddies and unspoiled rainforests to plantations and villages Bali is a walkerâ s dream This relatively compact and densely populated island is not suited to epic multi day treks but the range of day hikes and weekend treks will certainly keep you on your toes In West Bali National Park and on the most challenging peaks and volcanoes youâ ll need a guide but in most cases you can access and explore even remote areas under your own steam Apart from the interior of the Wild West most of Bali is fairly well populated with invariably welcoming and hospitable villages so finding provisions is rarely a problem These are the best hikes in Bali Mt Batur sunrise hike Best hike for photos Advertisement miles round trip hours moderate Mt Batur is Baliâ s most popular trek â and for good reason Youâ ll understand the attraction when you find yourself among other people gasping at the sunrise view from the summit across the caldera lake and past Mt Agung the islandâ s highest peak to Mt Rinjani on distant Lombok If you start hiking around you should be on the summit by sunrise Most visitors organize this as a tour from Ubud for easy access despite the early departure usually around to depending on the location of your accommodations and competition among tour operators keeps prices affordable Balinese Sunrise Trekking and Tour and Indoglobal Adventure are both reliable and well established operators who run daily treks up Batur Mason Adventures even offers an opportunity to take in the view over Batur from a helicopter It is possible to do this trek independently itâ s hard to get lost after all but before you decide to skimp on the outlay remember that the revenue represents crucial income for guides from rural communities Tours are usually over by and youâ ll certainly be in the mood for a hearty and healthy Bali breakfast Take water and an extra layer â it will probably be the coolest spot youâ ll see in Bali Spot incredible wildlife in West Bali National Park Â feathercollector Shutterstock West Bali National Park Best hike for spotting wildlife miles days challenging but shorter easy strolls are an option too This wilderness area in Baliâ s far west is likely to make you rethink everything you ever heard about overcrowded and overdeveloped Bali In Taman Nasional Bali Barat West Bali National Park you can plan anything from a two hour saunter to a full blown jungle expedition in a wilderness that was once home to tigers and rumors of them still abound On Prapat Agung Peninsula you are likely to be outnumbered by herds of Sunda deer along with common macaques and rare ebony leaf monkeys Thereâ s relatively little risk of getting lost on Prapat Agung Peninsula the most popular part of the park but you need a permit and a guide to access the trails of West Bali National Park The most convenient park office right at the entrance to the park on Prapat Agung is near a village called Sumber Kelompok north of Gilimanuk Arrive the afternoon before to make arrangements so that you can depart at first light the next morning and take advantage of cooler conditions and more visible wildlife Advertisement Guide rates vary sometimes wildly and you should expect to haggle A good guide can help you spot giant squirrels larger than domestic cats giant monitor lizards and many of Baliâ s estimated odd bird species In the park along with the most challenging peaks and volcanoes an experienced and knowledgeable guide is not only a worthwhile investment in safety terms but can also often turn a simple trek into a truly unforgettable experience Batukaru overnight summit Best hike for Bali bragging rights miles round trip days challenging At Batukaru is Baliâ s second highest peak yet one of the least trodden mountains on the island Two paths head to the top but neither sees a lot of footsteps and both can become overgrown in the wet season from October to February Most hikers start from Pura Luhur Batukaru on the southern flank but the northwestern trailhead at Pura Malen sitting at around altitude is even more isolated With a good level of fitness you can reach the summit in less than four hours so if you start at dawn you could make the climb up and down in a single day But for more of an adventure plan to camp on the summit It can be cold at the top so take a tent and sleeping bag and be sure to carry plenty of water because you canâ t always rely on streams Batukaru is unspoiled Bali at its best Sekumpul means Sekumpul Waterfall Best hike for a waterfall swim miles round trip hour easy The spectacular Sekumpul Waterfall is just far enough off the beaten track to dodge the high visitor numbers of more accessible spots like Gitgit Waterfall Banyumala Waterfalls and Jembong Waterfall Dropping a total of about into the fern shrouded pool Sekumpul is actually a group of seven falls that converge â the name means coming together â at this spot This experience is less of a trek than the perfect reason for a wonderful cool off swim in one of Baliâ s most idyllic beauty spots Other even less well known waterfalls Hidden and Fiji Falls lie within easy access of the Sekumpul trail Youâ ll find a ticket office in the parking lot where you can pay the admission fee A three tier pricing structure is in place Thereâ s an entrance fee of around per person about US which allows you view only access to see Sekumpul Waterfall from a distance Medium trekking access for about US gets you a guide and provides a donation to the local village and the opportunity to swim at the foot of the falls plus entry to nearby Hidden Falls The Long Trekking US ticket is essentially the same plus it gives access to Fiji Falls although these are less spectacular than the other waterfalls Mt Agung Best hike for pushing your limits miles round trip hours challenging The hike to the summit of Mt Agung â along with up to miles of its surroundings â is now open again after its eruption From the summit as you sit high above the clouds at above sea level itâ s easy to imagine that you are on top of the world and as the Balinese Hindus believe in the domain of the gods Even during periods when mighty Agung has been relatively peaceful it is wise to get up to date advice on conditions and to hire an experienced and knowledgeable guide Agung is not for the faint hearted The climb to the top is normally six to seven hours and the descent is markedly quicker Campuhan Ridge Walk offers an accessible stroll with lovely views right in Ubud Getty Images Campuhan Ridge Walk Best accessible hike miles round trip hours easy For such a short stroll the Campuhan Ridge Walk is surprisingly diverse taking in beautiful paddies fruit trees jungle valleys and even a temple Pura Gunung Lebah But this hike can get hot because thereâ s little shade to be found on top of the ridge Nevertheless this walk makes a pleasantly gentle stroll that despite being labeled a ridge walk is not too steep for small children The route is paved â although not smoothly enough to enable wheelchairs or strollers â making it accessible even in the rainy season when the terrace and jungle tracks around Ubud are impassably boggy Youâ ll find a couple of pleasant cafes and warungs local eateries at the end of the ridge so kids can be motivated with the promise of a healthy smoothie at the end If youâ re staying in central Ubud you donâ t need transport to get to the trailhead near Campuhan Bridge itâ s less than miles from Ubud Market Ubud residents enjoy this walk so as an added bonus itâ s a good opportunity to bump into more of those wonderful Balinese people Mundukâ s Twin Lakes Best hike for unspoiled lake views miles one way hours moderate A beautiful trail links the two highland lakes of Danau Tamblingan and Danau Buyan through shaded highland forest and along pristine lakeside paths Youâ re unlikely to see other hikers in this rarely visited area although in recent years the beautiful backdrops with their reflected peaks have become popular with wedding photographers who are lured not just by the photogenic scenery but also by ease of access Be sure to allow time to explore several picturesque temples including the exquisite little Pura Ulun Danau Tamblingan Take a sarong to wear to dress appropriately if a temple is in use If you have a driver the walk can be done in only one direction Parking areas can be found beside both lakes so you can be picked up at the opposite end Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address Subscribe now Subscribe to Lonely Planet newsletters and
