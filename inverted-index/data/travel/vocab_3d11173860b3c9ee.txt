What it s like to island hop in St Vincent the Grenadines St Vincent and the Grenadines consist of islands that are only a short distance away from each other making it a great place for island hopping Photograph by Karolina Wiercigroch TRAVEL A Caribbean island hopping adventure in St Vincent the Grenadines From volcanic peaks to coral fringed shores hopping between the Caribbean islands of St Vincent the Grenadines is blissfully easy By Sarah Barrell Photographs by Karolina Wiercigroch February This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Desron Lava Man Rodriguez is a person of few words but those he does utter can stop you in your tracks for this mild mannered softly spoken Vincentian can detail what it s like to climb an erupting volcano I didn t want anyone else telling me how it was up there he answers to the inevitable question why I had to witness it with my own eyes We re winding through the ashy foothills of La Soufrière the still smouldering stratavolcano that dominates St Vincent s northernmost tip The largest and most densely populated of the islands and cays that make up St Vincent the Grenadines this volcanic isle is a West Indies wonder Black sand beaches are backed by small villages half mooned around Caribbean bays devoid of international resort development And St Vincent s windward Atlantic shores are wilder still Its densely forested cliffs are home to more goats than people and they graze amid palms and surf sprayed cactuses We head inland from the ocean shores just beyond Georgetown where the road rides over Rabacca Dry River a gulch carved out by a eruption Its banks are once again deep in grey volcanic ash from La Soufrière s latest blast in At the road s end La Soufrière s four mile out and back summit trail has been cleared and reopened climbing steeply over It s a journey Lava Man often makes twice a day guiding visitors or just for fun as he s done since he was a child I ve always liked being outside in nature he says And why should the top blowing off the mountain interrupt his daily walks In March La Soufrière began notable effusive action exhaling clouds of gas with the underground magma activity sending tremors through the island On April the seismic research centre at University of the West Indies UWI with its customary exactitude predicted a full explosion within hours advising islanders in the northern red zone to evacuate immediately But some didn t leave a minor eruption in perhaps still lingering in local consciousness creating a false sense of ease Lava Man didn t evacuate In fact he drove into the red zone making tracks through ash thick roads small volcanic rocks raining down You d hear pow pow as they hit the ground One cracked my windscreen he tells me Then he climbed the mountain wearing a gas mask to film what was happening at the top I had to go around trees on the ground the path was gone But I know the way even with my eyes shut Over the course of the volcano s two weeks of eruptions he made the journey several times At first his Soufrière YouTube streams turned islanders against him his actions labelled doltish by the lead UWI scientist Professor Richard Robertson But when people saw the mountain on fire Lava Man says of his ash blasted broadcasts they really started evacuating then When he was finally caught by island police islanders rallied for his release Subsequently christened Lava Man Desron is now the go to guide for adventurers on the island But that s not why I did it And I wouldn t do it again I got my turn he says quietly before adding with a self effacing shrug God is great Lava Man Desron Rodriguez climbs the summit to the volcano often twice a day guiding travellers to the top Photograph by Karolina Wiercigroch Unlike the devastating explosion La Soufrière took no lives in And while its scorched summit is now a moonscape accessible via a final steep scramble that demands fitness and hiking boots lush vegetation has already reclaimed lower slopes It s amazing says Julicia Lewis another local guide joining our hike today It all came back so quickly We look down onto a thick forest of palms banyan and bread fruit trees unfurling towards the coast at Georgetown To think for weeks after the eruption we had no water she says Ash got in reservoirs We needed damp towels on windows to keep the ash out And it still got everywhere She laughs now but this young Vincentian woman actually gave birth to her second child the day before the eruption bringing the newborn home to her house in the capital Kingstown as islanders flooded in from the evacuated north We re resilient people she says with a smile We help each other She picks up a five fronded leaf fallen from a trumpet tree brown and curled inwards like a giant arthritic hand I want to make some tea and they re no good for that if they re still green she tells me Whether it s to cool the blood soothe griping stomachs or fight a cold which Julicia feels coming on there s little that bush tea can t cure according to Vincentian lore My grandma made it my mother too It s still a thing she says at a whisper as we stop to view a hovering hummingbird I once heard a parrot here says Julicia of national bird the St Vincent Amazon parrot I think it got confused after the eruption Their habitat is further south We don t spot the rainbow plumage of this endangered species but there are bright orange wings of paradise plants and chandeliers of epiphytes spilling from the canopy through tangles of strangler fig trees the beginnings and endings of plants hard to fathom But Julicia has her quarry Got it I ve been looking to show you this she announces as she lays a fern leaf on her forearm gives it a sharp slap and pulls it back to reveal the perfect imprint of its every tiny feathery frond on her skin rendered in a chalky white sap We call it clap hand she says grinning We loved it as kids My mum adds it to trumpet tea for that extra healing touch From rainforest to reef The Carib name for St Vincent Hairouna means Land of the Blessed and for all La Soufrière s devastation it has also blessed the island with rich volcanic soil in which an abundance of edible medicinal and grazing crop plants thrive Heading back south we pass a roadside memorial to the Defender of Hairouna Buffeted by Atlantic winds this paint peeling plaque is dedicated to St Vincent s national hero Joseph Chatoyer Also known as Satuye the Garifuna Carib chief with his troops of tenacious locals and runaway shipwrecked slaves held off British control of St Vincent for decades during the Carib Wars He was finally killed in battle in Two centuries of British rule followed but where sugar and banana plantation crops have dominated many Caribbean islands before and since emancipation St Vincent with its rich volcanic soil has diversified to become the region s fruit bowl It ll make you strong urges a woman selling freshly chopped callaloo in Kingstown market In contrast to the capital s florid colonial churches and ballast stone clapboard houses its concrete block market is a functional affair but a Caribbean powerhouse no less supplying the West Indies with a boggling range of produce including dried sea moss local honey ginger sorrel nutmeg and arrowroot The market resounds with the clang of works currently enlarging the island s cargo port across the street but despite this and the international airport that opened in St Vincent remains low key Leaving the capital we explore deserted beaches black with the island s ubiquitous volcanic sand that diamond sparkles in the sun People think it ll be rough but it s so soft right says Julicia at my idiot grin as we paddle in the surf the sand like velvet underfoot Callaloo leaves also known as amaranth are a versatile Caribbean leaf vegetable similar to spinach Photograph by Karolina Wiercigroch A rare strip of imported white sand graces the beach at Young Island This one hotel destination is accessed by a three minute ferry journey summoned from a phone in the small dock near Villa Beach St Vincent will open a Sandals Resort this spring but for now Young Island s confection of thatched cottage suites characterises St Vincent s locally run accommodation offering I fall asleep to the crash of waves the croak of frogs and the sound of soca music from Villa s small strip of bars more or less distant depending on which way the wind blows Sitting pretty in the southern Caribbean between St Lucia and Grenada St Vincent the Grenadines doesn t lack castaway opportunities and with a network of ferries and twin prop planes island hopping is affordable and easy The following morning a minute flight takes me low over a patchwork of Grenadine islands haloed in blues of impossibly brilliant hues It s as much bucket list thrill as A to B journey Barely minutes by motorboat from the shores of Union Island where we touch down I m out into that turquoise water nose to snout with hawksbill and green turtles grazing in the seagrass at Tobago Cays Marine Park This pristine protected reserve was a filming location for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise We skirt the shores of Petit Tabac the palm bristly sand spit where Kiera Knightly s Elizabeth Swan shouts at Johnny Depp s rum drunk Captain Sparrow in The Curse of the Black Pearl On neighbouring Petit Bateau I sample a dark spiced Vincentian rum named after the century brigand John Sparrow Ward who inspired the movies Sailors have long favoured this tiny island for rum punches conch and lobster barbecue In my dad s day it was just a beach bonfire Things have changed says Carlos Peters smiling as he indicates a newly built kitchen shelter with gas grills Carlos heads up an association of boat boys who taxi guests from their yachts to dine surf side on fresh catch We re trying to regulate things more how many boats operate how much fish is caught and sold Some old timers don t like it but it s the only way this is sustainable for everyone Local business is crucial for communities in the Grenadines a place plied by self sufficient cruise ships and famed for exclusive resort islands like Mustique a favourite of Jagger Bowie and Princess Margaret and Canouan where so the local joke goes billionaires go to escape the millionaires On Mayreau a mile hill ringed with white sand and coral reefs that s the only populated island within Tobago Cays reserve I meet John Roache Tall and statesman like the former history teacher dedicates his time to community development including tutoring local children Mayreau s population is about and are young people he tells me as we watch two boys dip fish with buckets off the dock We re a transit for marijuana he says of the nation s licence to export the crop to select countries where it s legal locally it was decriminalised for personal or medical use in This can change our youngsters They need careful direction John s work in progress book Wahya who we are explores the Grenadines history St Vincent and the Grenadines was the last of the West Indies Windward Islands to be ceded from the British in A daily issue in the Caribbean is succession Lots of people left after independence And despite his development work he says many in Mayreau still today don t own their land When not teaching John runs the island s sole grocery store where he displays the multiple prizes he s won for good works proudly showing me letters of commendation from Queen Elizabeth II We must embrace the complex multiplicity of our Caribbean nation he says of this perhaps surprisingly loyalist display We re Black but also English Irish and Asian To progress we need to bring all of us into the fold Nation builders Masani Defreitas is singing in Swahili It s rehearsal time at Ashton community centre on Union Island a brief pre dusk moment bringing biting sandflies and we re all trying not to fidget Dressed in a Ghanian headscarf and skirt Masani has her crew in check As her voice rises a strong contingent from the Imani Cultural Organization joins her in a chorus of song and drumming The dancers pause and their previous barefoot steps spins and jumps give space to electrifying sound Our DNA on Union Island traces back to West Africa says Masani at the song s close Whether in Swahili or Creole Union Island s folk culture of song and dance is going strong It s front and centre of the prestigious Maroon Festival before the rains in May and weddings here still involve a cake dance where women do a tricky ballet of cake balancing We also do meeting up when bride and groom parties meet in the street for a dance off says Masani And with that the group launches into a cherub song whose lyrics chide a man for being too late his girl s marrying someone else The dancers tonight ranging in age from seven to and one adult tag each other in and out of the circle I started this group in Some kids are now adults but still dance with me We re currently raising funds for a Ghana cultural exchange I want these children to understand where they re from Through dance and song the Imani Cultural Organisation passes on history and tradition to the younger generations Photograph by Karolina Wiercigroch Union Island is in the business of preservation Just three miles long and one wide this coral fringed idyll was once little known to outsiders beyond sailors and kitesurfers But in a new species of gecko was discovered here by local citizen scientists Mark da Silva and Matthew Harvey putting Union on the map We were actually investigating tarantula habitat says Matthew when I meet him in the tiny settlement of Pauper s Land on the south coast But we knew we d found something new The subsequent scientific paper inadvertently pinpointing these exquisite jewelled creatures saw them poached into endangered territory by People want them as pets explains Matthew s friend Roseman Adams another of Union s home grown conservationists and co founder of the Union Island Environmental Alliance With the help of partners like Fauna and Flora International the alliance has since put boots on the ground to deter poachers They re a small team but standing tall with shoulders seemingly as wide Roseman is an entire army in himself albeit one with a disarmingly easy charm He rounds up six alliance guides to help us explore Union s peaks where the lizard s range is contained in a small tract of forest It s one of the healthiest dry forests in the Caribbean home to many endemic species But development is encroaching says Roseman of Union s nascent tourism industry The guides stride ahead through the trees bringing back two geckos in a lensed specimen dish that magnifies the spectacular circular markings on their tiny bodies Then they re released again location undisclosed We ve learned to be careful says Roseman Union is one of the poorest islands in the Caribbean And these creatures are much more valuable to us alive The alliance organises tours the only way to see the geckos along with sustainable turtle spotting and raises money for Union s ultimate challenge water security We re reliant on rain for drinking water says Roseman as we putter along Chatham Bay in his electric tuk tuk getting a wave from everyone we pass And people are suffering more shortages with climate change He points out rain capture tanks funded by the alliance Elsewhere I spot wells in various states of disrepair the island s free roaming goats and cows in attendance Another issue says Roseman Free grazing causes crop shortages and erosion And we need our vegetation It s trees that attract rain on tropical islands Known as Young Buffalo it s clear Roseman is not easily deterred It s often about simple solutions but it takes a unified approach he says We re able to shelter from the heat thanks to one such simple solution shady walkways through the mangroves at Ashton Lagoon An ill placed causeway to Union s airport cut off water to the lagoon home to the Grenadines largest mangrove forest Strategic flush holes engineered by local environmental group SusGren means they re thriving again as are the fish bees and migratory birds that rely on them Roseman beams This is one of the best birding spots in the Caribbean now From Bequia a two hour ferry ride away I can see the Grenadines laid out like jewels A pickup truck taxi makes short work of the hilly hinterland climbing through fragrant forests of ylang ylang cashew and nutmeg to the lookout at Mount Pleasant Named island of the clouds by its early Arawak tribal settlers Bequia s sky is clear today and St Vincent the Grenadines and even Grenada rise out of the water like stepping stones enticing travellers onwards I resist however With its string of undeveloped beaches locally run hotels and relaxed rum shacks Bequia invites you to linger It s a place where yachties sail in and end up staying far longer than intended integrating into island life opening bars with names like Whaleboner In the port I buy a soursop ice cream at a pink painted shack the sun making shorter work of it than I do I scurry into the shade of Mauvin s Model Boat Shop Strung with hundreds of immaculately detailed wooden replicas of old Bequian schooners yachts and rigged rowing boats the place itself looks ready to set sail I started out years ago using coconut shells explains Mauvin Hutchins one of several islanders who make a living from model ships People come to Bequia because they love the sea love to sail And they want to take a bit a that home with them he says polishing the mahogany hull on a model of the island s elegantly masted former ferry Friendship Rose Outside modern motorised car ferries honk their arrivals summoning passengers to Mayreau Canouan and beyond Through the din loud and clear the call of a fisherman s conch shell alerts islanders to fresh catch just as it has done for centuries She don t run anymore says Mauvin of Friendship Rose But I guess island life doesn t change that much This story was created with the support of SVG Tourism and
