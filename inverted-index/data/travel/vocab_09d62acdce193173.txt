extravagant art nouveau structure with its organic swirling flourishes is the headquarters of the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores a society of music composers and publishers Although the interior is off limits to travelers the exterior is what you re here for â it s a decadent ode to Modernisme also known as Catalan modernism of which Antoni GaudÃ was the most famous exponent Step back into Madrid s past at de ChamberÃ The de ChamberÃ is a chance to step into Madrid s recent past In the several of Madrid s train stations were upgraded but the layout of ChamberÃ station meant that it couldn t be similarly modified Instead the station was bricked over and abandoned before reopening in as a museum and time capsule The interior appears much as it did in down to the posters
