Its continuing goal is to foster global collaboration in identifying and preserving invaluable cultural and natural properties UNESCO officials do not see the list as a mere trophy case of superlative places World Heritage status commits the home nation to protect the designated location The lands that have adhered to the World Heritage Convention are tasked not only with identifying future inscriptions but also monitoring how an already inscribed property is protected and managed Here are incredible photos of heritage sites in the U S If a site through natural disaster war pollution

delisted in the future Threats to our global treasures are mounting and sadly the list of World Heritage in Danger now includes sites Not all of them are as far flung as the rainforests of the
