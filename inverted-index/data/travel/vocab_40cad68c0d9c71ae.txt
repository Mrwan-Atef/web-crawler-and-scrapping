national embarrassment It took nearly years to build a tribute to the first U S president It was stalled by a lack of funds and at one point occupied by a political fringe group By Jennifer Barger February min read Few structures represent the United States as powerfully as the Washington Monument At the center of Washington D C the impressive marble obelisk feet tall and feet wide pays grand tribute to the first U S president George Washington It stars in tourist selfies postcards and nearly every movie filmed in the U S capital including some in which aliens attack it Independence Day Earth vs The Flying Saucers But the construction of this stone salute to the Revolutionary War hero and father of our country was far from straightforward It took nearly four decades to build the enormous monument in the mid century during which time it was occupied by a political fringe group beset by controversy and stalled by a lack of funds An engraving of the incomplete Washington Monument shows how its grounds were once used to pasture cattle Engraving by Frank Leslie Bridgeman Images The Washington Monument was as hotly contested in its day as Confederate statues are today says Erika Doss a professor of American Studies at Notre Dame University and author of the book Monument Mania Public Feeling in America Here s how this famed presidential monument was built and how it went from a national embarrassment to a national treasure Monuments for the father of a country Proposals to build a monument to George Washington started as early as when the new U S Congress resolved that an equestrian statue of General Washington be erected at the place where the residence of Congress shall be established Washington was a god like figure even before he died in He had led the Continental Army to victory over the British in the American Revolutionary War going on to serve as the first U S president from to But creating a monument for Washington wasn t just about one man it was about national identity says Paul McLane a guide for D C tour company Washington Walks It was the U S saying to the world this is us In the early century the new democracy was low on money and unenthused about shelling out for fancy statues or stone tributes So most monuments in early America were privately funded The U S government was very ambivalent about the arts It saw decoration and ornamentation as representing royalty or the church back in England says Lance Humphries executive director of the Mount Vernon Place Conservancy in Baltimore Maryland where the country s first Washington Monument was completed in Baltimore then a booming popular port compared to still sleepy Washington D C miles south used a public lottery to raise funds for its foot tall marble column capped by a dramatic statue of George It took a mere four years to build An undated photo shows Baltimore s Washington Monument Finished in it is the oldest complete monument to George Washington in the U S Photograph by George Rinhart Corbis via Getty Images In early century Washington D C the already dysfunctional U S Congress couldn t come to a consensus on what a monument to the first president might look like or how to pay for it Some statesmen thought Washington deserved a facsimile of Egypt s Great Pyramid The monument would be the first memorial on the National Mall the two mile long green space at the center of the capital city A group of private citizens took the reins and formed the Washington National Monument Society in Members including Supreme Court Justice John Marshall and ex president James Madison proposed soliciting public donations to bankroll a foot tall obelisk designed by Robert Mills the U S architect behind Baltimore s monument Mills envisioned surrounding the monolith s base with a columned National Pantheon populated with statues of early American heroes including George Washington driving a Roman style chariot Some guests were on hand for the laying of the cornerstone on July including former First Lady Dolley Madison and Alexander Hamilton s widow Eliza The Washington Monument is shown amid the Japanese cherry trees that bloom in the capital city each spring Photograph by Carol M Highsmith courtesy Library of Congress Prints Photographs A monument starts and stops The society began seeking money from individual states and private citizens who would each receive a lithograph of Mills original design if they donated more than With in funds workers first installed a foundation of blue gneiss stone then used pulleys derricks and other manual systems to hoist and place blocks of marble one on top of the other The structure was held together by gravity and friction By the monument was feet tall Learn about Mount Rushmore s heartbreaking tragic history As construction proceeded the society raised funds and interest by having states foreign countries Masonic lodges and other entities donate commemorative blocks of stone to be displayed inside the shaft of the obelisk These were mostly patriotic statements Illinois State Sovereignty National Union reads one But when Vatican City sent a stone in it unwittingly helped bring the whole project to a dramatic halt The slab of variegated marble came from a B C temple in Rome This riled up the anti Catholic anti immigration sentiments of the Know Nothings a nativist political party Party loyalists reportedly broke into the Washington Monument site absconding with the Pope s Stone and throwing it in the nearby Potomac River It was never recovered but the interior walls of the finished monument hold of the commemorative stones visible on the elevator descent from its top The Know Nothings then infiltrated the monument committee and essentially occupied the site from to The controversy and the economic downturn caused by the American Civil War essentially stopped construction George s obelisk remained a half finished stump and the land surrounding it became a cattle pasture during the war Finishing the job After the Civil War ended in the incomplete monument was decried as a national embarrassment The ungainly old chimney is of no earthly use to anybody else and certainly is not in the least ornamental wrote Mark Twain in It is an eyesore to the people It ought to be either pulled down or built up and finished Monument supporters successfully rallied Congress to pay for the monument to be completed securing to finish the job Construction resumed in But the government didn t want to spend too much on the project so there went all the froufrou around the base says historian John Steele Gordon author of Washington s Monument and the Fascinating History of the Obelisk What they ended up with was not at all what Mills had in mind thank God Mills sniffed that the unadorned obelisk would resemble a stalk of asparagus The U S Army Corps of Engineers tasked with overseeing construction was concerned that the existing foundations wouldn t support the original design s foot height So they rebuilt and expanded the existing foundation and trimmed the monument s height to feet A newfangled steam elevator was installed to aid with construction it would later be repurposed to take tourists on to minute trips to the top By late the obelisk was completed with a capstone or pyramidion on top making it the tallest structure in the world at least until the Eiffel Tower came along in The Washington Monument was dedicated on February the day before the first president s birthday The surprising art filled tale of the Lincoln Memorial Since then the monument has gotten a series of ever faster ever fancier elevators It closed for renovations several times over the years including after it suffered damage during a rare for D
