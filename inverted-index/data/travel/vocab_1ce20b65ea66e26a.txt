Celtic languages are still spoken Yet more than years ago Celts controlled territories across Europe from Spain Portugal Belgium and Britain in the west to Hungary Slovakia Romania Slovenia and Croatia to the east Although they never formed an empire Celts were bound by common language and culture In the late fifth century B C Celtic tribes from Switzerland Germany and the Czech Republic first became influential in what s now called Hungary says András Tóth archaeologist at Aquincum Museum Slightly more than a century later they commanded the land on which the current Hungarian capital was later built Hunting a hidden town Mystery shrouds this first Celtic settlement in Budapest which is yet to be unearthed Tóth says To date the most important Celtic site discovered here is a large cemetery on Csepel Island up to years old From to excavations here revealed bodies dressed in ornate garments and buried with fine jewellery weapons and ceramics By the first century B C

population did not cease their language customs elements of their culture and the Celtic names of their settlements were retained for many decades says Láng of the early Aquincum era Halloween helps preserve Budapest s Celtic heritage Now however Hungary s Celtic heritage has disappeared says Krisztián Varga who has studied Celtic history for years and is involved with the museum s Samhain festival It is largely the same he says in every nation where Celts flourished except Ireland Scotland and Wales The survival of Celtic culture in the British Isles was greatly aided by a strong sense of identity with the modern population considering themselves direct descendants of Celts he says The eastern Celts however had a different story Their culture gradually dissolved as they intermingled with the local population Two millennia later Budapest s strongest link to its Celtic era is the upcoming Samhain event Now in its fifth year this unique spectacle aims not only to attract visitors to Aquincum Museum which sits anonymously in the city s quiet northern suburbs But also to highlight the underappreciated impact of the Celts whose pioneering efforts lay hidden beneath Budapest Ronan O
