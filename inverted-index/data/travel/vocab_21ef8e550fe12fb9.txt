Diana Rita Cabrera Jan min read Share Apply early for a visa to Cuba unless you re one of the few nationalities that don t need one Â Matt Porteous Getty Images Cuba is a Caribbean paradise but because of the islandâ s tumultuous history and international relations its visa rules can be complicated â especially for visitors from the US We ve rounded up all the key information you need to know about Cuba â s entry requirements including details on the various types of visas how to secure them and what they ll cost you Do I need a visa to visit Cuba Citizens of some Caribbean Asian and European countries including Russia Montenegro Serbia and Singapore can travel visa free to Cuba for up to days with a passport that doesnâ t expire for at least six months Advertisement Passport holders from all other countries must purchase what is known officially as a Cuba Tourist Card although it s often referred to as a Cuban visa You can get a Cuba Tourist Card one of three ways â pick it up yourself from the Cuban consulate in your home country apply through the officially licensed third party Visa Cuba or have one included as part of a travel package purchased through a travel agency or airline Youâ ll need to provide your passport number home address the address of your booked accommodations in Cuba and information on your confirmed flights Depending on your country of origin visa fees range from US to US â additional costs apply depending on who you purchase it from in person at the consulate is the best way to avoid add on handling fees If you apply by mail you must send all needed documentation plus a self addressed return envelope so that the consulate can mail your visa card back to you Advertisement Most visitors require a visa to explore the rich history and culture of Cuba Â TiagoBaiao iStock Getty Images How do I use my tourist card in Cuba As you depart Cuba at the end of your trip you must present your Cuba Tourist Card to immigration authorities â make sure to store it in a safe place for the duration of your vacation If you lose it during your stay on the island youâ ll have to wait a few hours for the authorities to clear you and issue a new document before you head back home The Cuba Tourist Card allows for a single entry day stay in Cuba days for Canadian citizens but if you decide to stay longer you can renew your visa for another days at your hotel desk or at the nearest local immigration office Is it possible to re enter the USA after I have been to Cuba Unfortunately many non US citizens have been caught out by the January change to the US ESTA Electronic System for Travel Authorization rules which now state that your ESTA is invalid if you have traveled to Cuba This doesn t mean you cannot go to Cuba via the USA and back it just means you need to apply for a US visa from a US embassy or consulate For additional information about travel eligibility under the Visa Waiver Program ie the ESTA go to the US Customs and Border website While vintage American cars are everywhere in Cuba American tourists are less so Â Bim Getty Images Can Americans visit Cuba The rules on Americans visiting seem to change with each new presidential administration Yet the bottom line remains the same Americans are allowed to visit Cuba but traveling for tourism is not officially allowed The US Department of State issues licenses for categories of travel which include family visits educational exchanges and humanitarian projects Independent American travelers might qualify to use the â support for the Cuban peopleâ category anyone who does this however must provide a detailed itinerary of the planned visit Additionally US travelers are required to keep all travel receipts from Cuba for five years While American citizens are forbidden from staying in Cubaâ s government run hotels they can stay in casas particulares private homestays If youâ re a US citizen you still need to purchase a Cuban Tourist Card â it s just a little different from the regular one itâ s pink in contrast to the green cards for other nationalities as well as more expensive Costs average around US but we ve seen up to US The final amount depends on the travel agency and its handling fees Fees also apply depending on how you get the tourist card â in person at the Cuban consulate in Washington DC or by post You may be able to buy your tourist card directly from the airline youâ re traveling to Cuba with Contact them for the latest information Itâ s worth using an experienced USâ Cuba travel organizer like Insight Cuba or Cuba Educational Travel â they ll be able to answer all your questions and help you navigate the bureaucracy Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get
