and the Tamar Valley Australia Andrew Bain Aug min read Share Launceston is blessed with top notch dining excellent fresh produce world class wineries and access to national parks brimming with wildlife Getty Images Launceston might be Tasmania â s second largest city but itâ s a place where nature and nurture continue to play leading roles With a deep and dramatic gorge reaching almost into the city center Launceston is surrounded by the wine producing slopes of the Tamar Valley where lush red volcanic soils nourish some of Australiaâ s finest produce Itâ s this combination of fine food and premium wine along with the wealth of island seafood that fuels a dining scene that saw this city of just people anointed as a UNESCO City of Gastronomy in â one of only such cities in the world and just the second in Australia Advertisement When youâ re done wining and dining Launceston is also a prime base for explorations into Tasmaniaâ s celebrated outdoors it s closer than the capital Hobart to the stateâ s star natural feature of Cradle Mountain and only a drive to Wineglass Bay in Freycinet National Park Launceston and the Tamar Valley Tasmania Australia is one of the best regions to visit next year See our full list of Best in Travel winners Summer is the perfect time to visit nearby the lavender farm at Bridestowe Lavender Estate Ian Woolcock Shutterstock When should

contemplating day trips the lavender rows at photogenic Bridestowe Lavender Estate the largest lavender farm in the Southern Hemisphere are at their flowering finest Autumn March to May brings the yearâ s most stable weather conditions with lingering warmth and a thinning of summer crowds Itâ s also the time of harvest around the Tamar Valley vineyards How much time should I spend in Launceston and the Tamar Valley How deep is your thirst Time in Launceston might be dictated by cellar doors with wineries spilling along both banks and the backing slopes of the Tamar Valley The city itself can be covered in a couple of days If the sun is shining you might want to add a day to follow the locals to the beach at nearby favourite Bridport around an hourâ s drive northeast of the city All considered a week should provide ample time to get to know Launceston and explore its surrounds And youâ ll need all of those evenings to tick your way through Launcestonâ s best restaurants Launceston s city center is walkable with Cataract Gorge strolling distance away Shutterstock Is it easy to get in and around Launceston and the Tamar Valley Launceston has quick links to the mainland with Launceston Airport just to the cityâ s south Vehicle ferries sail from Geelong Victoria to Devonport to Launcestonâ s west Buses operated by Kinetic run between Launceston and Hobart taking around three hours and continue on to Devonport and Burnie Launcestonâ s city center is compact and walkable with even Cataract Gorge at strolling distance â itâ s a minute walk from the mall on Brisbane St to the mouth of the gorge A number of companies provide tours and transport to wineries in the Tamar Valley Top things to do in Launceston and the Tamar Valley Dining delights If Launcestonâ s dining scene is good enough to impress UNESCO you know youâ re in for a treat The cityâ s secret is in its soils and seas with exquisite local produce and seafood forming the building blocks of Launceston menus Go to the source at the Harvest Market which fills a city center parking lot each Saturday morning with vegetables cheese berries oysters mushrooms cider whisky hazelnuts and a whole lot more Advertisement The restaurant scene is strong and accented by local flavours Headlining the offerings are stalwarts such as Stillwater set inside an flour mill by the mouth of Cataract Gorge and the meaty munchies of Black Cow Bistro delivering sought after cuts such as Robbins Island wagyu and Cape Grim beef Even the vineyards are in on the food game with some fine dining rooms tucked within cellar doors The restaurant at Josef Chromy Wines in Relbia at the southern edge of Launceston has been â hattedâ â an Australian nod to the best restaurants â while local is law at Timbre looking out over kanamaluka River Tamar from Velo Wines For breakfast or brunch start the day the right way at Earthy Eats with its focus on local sustainable ingredients or Bread Butter inside an old motorcycle warehouse and making the bread and butter of its name on site Locals picnic and swim at the public pool here by the river in the summer months Shutterstock Cataract Gorge Imagine the tourist crush if there was a deep craggy gorge reachable within of the city center of New York Tokyo or any other major world city But such is Launcestonâ s natural advantage â with the South Esk River carving through the hills to form the magnificent Cataract Gorge Doubling as Launcestonâ s central play piece the gorge is threaded with walking trails Head as far upstream as the old Duck Reach Power Station â one of the worldâ s first hydroelectric plants â inside the gorge then double back to First Basin where most of the gorge action takes place Set into its lawns is an open air public swimming pool open November to March while the worldâ s longest single span chairlift zips across the river At its end among wallabies and peacocks Gorge Restaurant adds zest to a gorge visit with high tea or lunch Kayakers fight the rapids through the gorge during water releases from the upstream dam while daily boat trips with Tamar River Cruises nose into the gorge for perspective from the water Tamar Valley wineries Tasmania crushes just of Australiaâ s wine but itâ s premium level highly regarded and at its most concentrated in the Tamar Valley that stretches north from Launceston Itâ s a compact wine region split into neat halves by kanamaluka River Tamar making it a pleasure to tour and taste The Tamar Wine Route incorporates around cellar doors from rustic Swinging Gate with its welcoming party of Nellie the dog who once graced the cover of a book about winery dogs to the architecturally arty Stoney Rise Meet one of the Tamar Valley wine pioneers Andrew Pirie at appointment only Apogee and feed apples to the house pig Pinot dâ Pig at Holm Oak Pinot noir is king in this cool climate region but the range of varietals is broad Bubbles take over around Pipers Brook on the east bank and theyâ re of world class quality House of Arras â s EJ Carr Late Disgorged was named the worldâ s best sparkling in and its creator Ed Carr was named Sparkling Winemaker of the Year at the International Wine Challenge in only the second time the award had been won by a winemaker from outside France Divide a wine stay into two a journey along the west bank will cover around while a loop along the east bank and Pipers Brook makes for a drive See Australian wildlife like Forester kangaroos in Narawntapu National Park Shutterstock My favourite thing to do in Launceston and the Tamar Valley Itâ s tough not to just keep wandering into and through Cataract Gorge when I find myself in Launceston but Iâ m inevitably drawn north â downstream through the Tamar Valley â to where the wild things are Narawntapu National Park has been dubbed the â Serengeti of Australiaâ â and while itâ s a fanciful title its vast clearings at Springlawn heave with wallabies and Forester kangaroos around dawn and dusk The long white stripes of often empty Bakers Beach and Badger Beach are a sandy bonus Atop kanamaluka River Tamar the critter crawl continues at Platypus House where despite the name the crazy concoction that is the platypus is unexpectedly outshone by the echidnas â come at feeding time and theyâ ll be all but scrambling over your feet Cross the river to Low Head near sunset and the wild animal of choice is little penguins shuffling ashore across a small beach visited by Low Head Penguin Tours Your toes might even get a tiny trample again How much money do I need for Launceston and the Tamar Valley Thereâ s little around Launceston and the Tamar Valley that s the absolute top end for accommodation but thereâ s a nice spread of good hotels through to glamping in the vines and bare bones beachside camping at Narawntapu National Park Quality dining comes at a price reflective of Tasmaniaâ s emergence as a premium food producer but the wealth of outdoor possibilities makes for cheap exploration during the days National park campground site AU Dormitory bed in a hostel AU Room in a hotel from AU Public transport ticket around AU per bus ride Coffee AU Pub meal AU Dinner at a top end restaurant AU Pint of craft beer AU Locals enjoying an enviable life overlooking the Tamar River David Lade Shutterstock Bring plenty of layers no matter the season You can spot a Tasmanian by the fact that they carry a jumper with them regardless of the season â weather conditions and temperatures can turn rapidly and significantly When the sun is out temperatures here feel warmer than the number suggests but when it turns cold everyone grabs for their â Tassie tuxedoâ â the local term for a down jacket Whatâ s in a name If you want to win over the Launceston locals get the pronunciation of their city rightâ it s lon cess ton Ski out more than ski in Launceston is the closest city to Tasmaniaâ s prime ski field Ben Lomond just an hour away by car but with Tasmaniaâ s maritime climate dumps are infrequent and snow conditions fluky There are often just a few ski days each winter so check ahead on conditions if you fancy hitting the slopes Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address Subscribe now Subscribe to Lonely Planet newsletters and
