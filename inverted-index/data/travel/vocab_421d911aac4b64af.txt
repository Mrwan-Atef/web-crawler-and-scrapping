Bloomberg Getty Images TRAVEL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Will new travel technology invade your privacy Digital facial recognition COVID tracing apps Innovations that make trips safer during a pandemic might expose your personal data By Johanna Read September min read The tech revolution in the travel world accelerated by the COVID pandemic is at once marvelous and invasive of your privacy Apps facial recognition and smart products can make air transit and border crossings more convenient Their touch free and skip the line elements may help keep you safer from illness causing viruses New tech may also speed up the return to normal travel like the the World Economic Forum and The Commons Project collaboration CommonPass initiative which aims to allow governments to validate individuals COVID testing and eventually vaccination credentials But such innovation comes with some risks For a cautionary tale about travel technology and data security look no further than a recent episode involving former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott who posted a photo of his Qantas Airlines boarding pass on his Instagram account only to see a hacker scan the coding and obtain the ex PM s passport number Paper tickets are old school But they illustrate that cyber sneaks are eager to use their HTML scanning database mining skills for good or ill In Abbott s case the hacker exposed security flaws in a ploy to discourage people from flaunting their boarding passes and other sensitive documents online The airline responded by upgrading security protocols When you head back out into a world of new travel technology how can you protect your personal information Facial recognition tech Singapore always ahead of the tech curve announced it will be the first country in the world to use facial recognition on government issued IDs starting in September By the U S Department of Homeland Security expects to be using facial recognition on percent of travelers Related Will facial recognition technology invade your privacy The answer is complex The COVID pandemic has created new technology too and concerns about its ramifications In some countries visitors must download contact tracing apps Belize or wear a GPS tracker during quarantine in Hong Kong and for some travelers to Grenada For the time being tracking and tracing may be the price of traveling during a viral outbreak The most secure contact tracing apps use Bluetooth and don t auto upload info to a central database But in June Amnesty International called out Bahrain Kuwait and Norway for overly invasive apps and Qatar for a security flaw that made personal info vulnerable to hackers At Serbia s Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport authorities used a thermal scanner to help monitor possible coronavirus cases entering the country on March Photograph by Oliver Bunic Bloomberg Getty Images The ramifications of facial recognition programs for travelers are still blurry If you have concerns about privacy you might want to be wary of all that scanning and recording of your features At U S airports passengers can opt out of biometric identification at customs and other checkpoints but you ll have to ask And it could flag you for further screening or make it look like you have something to hide so it might be easier to just go with the flow While it may feel compromising that your mug even COVID masked will become your passport boarding pass or entry to that free hotel breakfast it s fair to ask whether this is any more invasive than other ways technology uses photos to track our movements and interests Google Images is already doing a great job recognizing you from your online photos says Vinny Troia an ethical hacker and CEO of risk assessment firm Night Lion Security Facebook automatically does a facial recognition search when you upload photos and suggests tagging the people it detects in each image Mostly harmless invasions of privacy Boarding a plane with just a flick of your phone screen is futuristic and easy Reservation chatbots and hotel airline and car rental databases seem helpful But there are ways that this technology could mine and use your data Some of it is harmless Your search for a house rental on the beaches of North Carolina might flood your social media feeds with ads for barbecue joints Using apps Facebook Tiktok WeChat does expose your data which is sold to third parties for advertising data modeling and future uses we have not even considered says privacy and data security lawyer Mark McCreary Thanks to travelers data businesses are better able to model and predict travel demand timing and pricing tolerance Big data is big business in the travel industry A passenger shows a health code on her mobile phone as she checks in for a flight at China s Beijing

much personal data Photograph by Hou Yu China News Service Getty Images Related Nano needles facial recognition and robots How tech is making air travel safer If you have no qualms about posting a

and search history periodically or browse for flights or rental cars in private mode The good news Most general purpose travel apps e g accommodation and transport booking city guides etc aren t especially risky in terms of your privacy says Dave Dean founder of Too Many Adapters a site demystifying travel tech He warns that social media apps Facebook Instagram typically collect more sensitive data than booking ones and use it in more invasive ways Yet most people happily use those every day More serious security breaches Bigger threats than unwanted ads or facial scans include someone using travel technology to hack into your bank accounts credit cards or to steal your identity Travelers are often in unfamiliar places easily distracted and more likely to be victims of both physical theft or cyberattacks for example your phone or computer hacked into via the wifi at a Moscow caf√© Digital invasions can result in less obvious invasions like sniffing kind of like bugging a phone malware and phishing Related Robotics are changing our world Should you be worried Cybercriminals routinely create networks and legit sounding websites to steal your usernames passwords and contacts A good precaution is to limit your use of public wifi which is typically left unsecured and represents an attractive target for hackers says Attila Tomaschek a researcher at privacy tool review site ProPrivacy Paul Lipman CEO at cybersecurity company BullGuard recommends using devices that contain only the data you ll need for that trip especially when visiting countries where government officials have the right or inclination to access your devices The solution A light tech footprint The best solution may be to pack light both digitally and physically Dean stores as little info as possible on his devices keeping only the apps he really needs and regularly revoking third party permissions to Google and Facebook He recommends minimizing apps access to your contacts and

home Everything else phone tablet meeting notes all went with me every time I left my hotel room In some countries state operators can and will resort to espionage to gain a competitive edge including breaking into the hotel safe to get your laptop for a quick download or to install monitoring malware It all sounds a little like a spy movie in which you your data and your attention span get turned
