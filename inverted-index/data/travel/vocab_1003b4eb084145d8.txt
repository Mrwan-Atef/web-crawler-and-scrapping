Chamidae Ford Feb min read Share Views from the Rockaway Hotel Rooftop Chamidae Ford Lonely Planet As seemingly everyone jets off to international destinations have you thought about staying put The term staycation was coined in the and took on a starring role during COVID when we tried to convince ourselves that being trapped in our homes was equal to a fabulous getaway But now instead of staying home I am suggesting you go on vacation locally Visit a new part of your city or town no further than hours away snag a stunning hotel room and indulge in relaxation and hotel amenities This is what my boyfriend Dylan and I decided to do for our two year anniversary Call it a â baecation â Since neither of us had time for a long getaway we opted for a short break to New York City s Rockaways neighborhood instead This beachy part of Queens is a staple weekend haunt for New Yorkers though one I rarely take part in I never really could get with hauling all my beach supplies on the subway just to get scorched under the sun â and then have to take the subway back home Advertisement This time we approached it differently The Rockaway Hotel is a beachy oasis steps away from the ocean Rockaway Hotel Kyle Knodell Where we stayed An important part of a staycation The stay It is worth choosing a hotel that provides comfort and amenities The ideal place only requires you to go off campus if you need of a change of scenery And that is precisely what we got at the Rockaway Hotel We had the pleasure of being hosted by the hotel and ended up staying in a deluxe king room with ocean views and a terrace The room was cozy and perfectly embodied the beachy vibe â although we spent much more time enjoying the amenities than hanging in the room If there is one thing we love to do itâ s swim so we loved spending time in the heated pool Dylan and I posted up in one of the hotelâ s cabanas and drank frozen Aperol spritzes while hopping between the warm water of the pool and the outdoor saunas We had some delicious meals while dining at Margie s and the Pool House two of the Rockaway Hotel s restaurants Chamidae Ford Lonely Planet What we ate Margie s We ate here twice during our stay The first night I had a dirty martini and Dylan enjoyed an old fashioned The meal was fantastic We canâ t seem to skip burrata if it s on the menu so that s what we started with We also enjoyed calamari with sweet chili sauce crisp grilled asparagus fries obviously and a steak to split For dessert we had cheesecake with a candle in it in honor of our anniversary The second time around we went a bit more casual and split the burger and the little gem Caesar salad It was arguably the perfect meal Advertisement The Pool House We started our second day at the outdoor restaurant next to the hotel There was a bit of a wait for our breakfast but it was arguably one of the most photogenic pieces of toast Iâ ve ever received Totally worth it Supply Shop As we were leaving to go home we grabbed a coffee from here which is located off the lobby The space also has a number of pastries and treats worth trying Rippers offsite During our bike ride we stopped at this boardwalk restaurant serving grass fed burgers and some of the best fries Iâ ve had in a while Located on Beach St it has an endearing retro vibe and provides the perfect lunch spot whether you are biking like us or hanging out in the water We chose to split some fries as a snack and I also enjoyed a Yuzu margarita while Dylan opted for a beer Happy Jackâ s Burger Bar offsite Located across the street from the hotel this small burger joint is a casual spot for pre dinner drinks at a reasonable price I had a glass of wine and Dylan had a beer The burgers looked delicious but we knew we wanted to catch the sunset so we ended up heading back to the hotel s rooftop Board Walk Bagels Delicatessen offsite After checking out we stopped by this breakfast spot for a massive sausage egg and cheese bagel to take with us on the road His and hers bicycles and martinis plus the sunset Does it get better than that Chamidae Ford Lonely Planet Things you shouldnâ t miss Spa treatment No baecation is complete without a coupleâ s spa treatment â and boy did we get the ultimate experience We opted for the sugar body scrub which included being rubbed down with an exfoliating scrub sipping rosÃ in the sauna taking a shower and having shea butter massaged into our skin Bike rides On day two we decided to take out the complimentary bikes the hotel has for guests which we had been eyeing since we arrived The beach is ridiculously close and although it wasnâ t warm enough to go in the water we cruised along the boardwalk for hours taking in the scenery and getting a little exercise Pool Embrace your inner child and take part in the joy of playing in the pool Show off your underwater handstand see who can hold their breath the longest race to the other end of the pool the options are endless Sauna The hotel has an outdoor sauna next to the pool and another in the spa Both are fantastic and what better way to recover from bike rides and cocktails than sweating out those toxins Beach Whether you bike or walk the beach is super close and there are tons of little shops and restaurants along the boardwalk If you re brave dip your feet in Sunset Is there anything more romantic than watching the sunset over cocktails with your significant other On our second night we nearly missed it and ended up running to the Rockaway Rooftop dirty martini and old fashioned in hand to watch On this perfectly clear temperate evening we got to see the sun sink below the horizon while the entire outline of Manhattan s skyline shimmered in the distance It was a beautiful moment You ll find us enjoying rosÃ post spa treatment and lounging at the poolside cabanas Chamidae Ford Lonely Planet What makes this experience so special Sometimes the best baecation is a staycation â a lesson I learned after my two day break in my home city This ended up being such a joyful getaway and a chance to enjoy each other s company The Rockaways make for a great staycation from NYC because itâ s close yet a world away from the city We traded in our work wear for swimsuits and commutes for relaxing rides on a beach cruiser We forgot about everything happening in our real lives â and instead drank cocktails and played in the pool I would have stayed a week if time had allowed Getting there As you may have learned from my walk down the length of Manhattan with my colleague Ann Douglas Lott Dylan does in fact have a car which we used to get to the Rockaways That being said there are a few public transportation options If taking the subway the A and S trains get relatively close to the hotel The ferry costs just a bit more than the subway and is a glorious ride allowing you to experience the beauty of New York City from a different perspective The docks are within walking distance
