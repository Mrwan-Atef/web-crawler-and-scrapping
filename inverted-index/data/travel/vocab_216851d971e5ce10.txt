See all See what travelers are saying Learn more Trenton New Jersey contributions of bubbles On a quick pre business holiday I chose to visit the Duomo di Milano as one of my experiences in Milan It s pretty straightforward to secure tickets online and you have several options that include access to the crypt a walk up to the terraces several underground spaces and of course a tour of the cathedral and its artwork The technology is excellent with headsets to hear the tour guide Our guide was English speaking We went to several areas of the cathedral during our classic tour first in the lower levels of the Duomo to enjoy the artwork next to underground canal space and archeological site and finally the terrazas with grand and expansive views to all of Milan The chapel is both beautiful and fills the soul I recommend that you spend time in the pews after the tour I found the alters very moving and lit a few candles and spent moments in prayer There are also many different melding of astrological folk and religious symbols throughout the cathedral that lift up the bridging of multiple parts of Italian culture The most important thing to do to prepare is to wear the appropriate clothes It is a house of worship They stress many many times that they ask all people to wear pants that go below the knees and cover the shoulders and to wear close toed shoes that are required on the terraces Our guide was kind to offer people pieces of a poncho but ultimately one family left because their teenage girl who seemed to be bothered and embarrassed Read more Visited July Traveled solo Written January Caracas Venezuela contributions of bubbles The Duomo is a mandatory stop in Milan either to value its beautiful external structure or to dare to start the adventure of walking its roofs and assess a little more closely La Madonnina golden statue of the Virgin Mary that is on the cusp of one of the highest towers Admission to the Duomo is paid about you can also purchase ticket for entrance to the Cathedral lift to the Terrace Museum for about IMPORTANT month recommended to buy tickets via web to purchase tickets directly at the box office the line is very extensive Elevator climb is recommended IMPORTANT the descent of the Terrace you do not do by elevator it is via stairs and are steps It is very worth climbing to the Terrace not only because of the views of Milan from the roof of the Duomo but because you can value architectural beauty much more closely If you are a Catholic entering the compound and praying in front of its beautiful altar will make your experience unforgettable PS don t forget to take your photos by day and also at night it s always a show Read more Visited September Traveled solo Written February Dimo CH Varna Bulgaria contributions of bubbles I recommend buying tickets to the roof of the cathedral to the cathedral and the museum online with the Fast Track option on a weekday Starting from the second half of Friday and all weekend there will be a lot of people Even with the above mentioned function you will have to stand in line for almost an hour at the elevator And on the roof of the cathedral it will be completely crowded The ticket costs euros and is valid for days from the date of purchase Believe me the impressions will be much greater than the money paid Read more Visited November Traveled solo Written November rachel m Waringstown United Kingdom contributions of bubbles Worth paying the extra for the fast track as it can get extremely busy I would also recommend getting there first thing as it will be considerably quieter on the roof top Great views with amazing architecture Don t rush it and take the time to look at the detail It does say to arrive with legs and shoulders covered With fast track if you don t they provide you with the most useless see through paper dress that is just to your knees All very pointless Apart From that though the building itself is worth it Read more Visited August Traveled with family Written August Canterbury United Kingdom contributions of bubbles The cathedral is a huge and hugely impressive building both inside and out There are helpful guides who can tell you about its construction I recommend paying a bit extra to take the tour of the roof you can ascend by stairs or by a lift the views are amazing and it s fascinating and vertigo inducing to see the spires etc from high up We visited on a weekday when it is likely to be far less busy shorter queues Read more Visited May Traveled as a couple Written June Elizabeth R contributions of bubbles This place is absolutely stunning We had tickets to the rooftop Thursday night and then toured in inside the next day on Friday Highly recommend the rooftop which is only open thursdays through the summer so try to plan accordingly There was also a musical performance for the evening we went it was a cellist We did not get a guided tour for the rooftop I think it would be interesting and would enhance the experience but is not necessary For the inside we had an audioguide which did point out a lot of things we would have otherwise missed but I think you could experience without We took so many photos because this place really is so breathtaking you will not run out of things to look at Also we used Rick Steve s Audio Europe to do a walking tour around the Duomo neighborhood which is a nice option if youre waiting for you Duomo ticket time or just as an educational stroll Read more Visited July Traveled with family Written June Anda Negulescu Bucharest Romania contributions of bubbles We visited Milan in a group tour shortly before New Year and were hoping for a less crowded day As the weather was sunny and mild for a December day or maybe nor only therefore there was a sea o enthusiastic people waiting to see the Cathedral We managed to secure entrance tickets to the church itself but there were no vacancies to visit the roof terrace for the next more than a week Although we had an admission time already set and highlighted on the admission ticket there was a huge cue for entering Luckily being in a large group allowed us to cue separately and manage to enter in due time otherwise I doubt we would have succeeded Be advised that there is a security control similar to airport control so make sure you don t carry anything that prevents you from getting in Cathedral is a magnificent gothic work of art and all artefacts on display fill visitor with awe and admiration for fine anticraft Words cannot describe it true to life enough so it s a must see Read more Visited December Traveled as a couple Written January CattyKy Israel contributions of bubbles Definitely one of the most beautiful duomos I ever saw Beautiful in the day light and as well with the lights in the evening If you dont want to stand in queue or pay extra fee for entrance just take couple of steps away and enjoy the beautity You can as well go up to the upper floor inside the Rinascente mall and enjoy the stanning view on the Duomo roof Enjoy Read more Visited January Traveled with friends Written May Falmouth United Kingdom contributions of bubbles On a Saturday morning we got our tickets euros each from the tourist office in the Duomo square surprisingly it took less than minutes to get the tickets Then queued for about minutes at the front of the Duomo to enter inside Huge cathedral with amazing pillars and beautiful windows Lots to take in so good to just sit on a pew and absorb all the splendour We enjoyed seeing the interior but equally enjoyed just walking around the Duomo outside The intricate marble exterior with the many statues gargoyles and figures are truly amazing Read more Visited September Traveled as a couple Written October Yannis D Athens Greece contributions of bubbles The temple captivates you externally with its size and shape but up there Internal is lower than expectations In my opinion it has become a profitable business since it wants separate tickets to see individual sections of the temple such as the crypt the roof and the archaeological site It also has another value if you want to climb the roof with the elevator but it stops at the first roof and then you have to climb about steps to climb to the last roof where you can take nice photos For the descent there is no elevator except with the stairs in a rough staircase There is control at the entrance Physical but also in the contents of the bag Backpacks and large bags are not allowed It will be advisable to timely pick up tickets for the places you want to visit via the internet to avoid delays but also any unavailability for the day and time you want to visit the temple Read more Visited October Traveled as a couple Written October These

more impressive than inside When I visited there was a lot of conservation work going on inside around the altar which made it a little hard to appreciate I understand why a lot of critics thought it

inside experience and it didn t disappoint The detail of the stone work on the outside is truly amazing such skill by every craftsman involved To get to the roof via the stairs certainly gets the lungs going As for the inside you come down the stairs from the roof and through a door to the back of the church makes the hairs stand up such a feeling such an emotional experience The architecture inside is breathtaking could have sat for hours just taking it all in so much to see so much history A must for a visit to Milan Read more Written April This review is the subjective opinion of a

the architecture is mind blowing We didn t pay to go in having been to the Vatican we didn t think this would compare but it is still stunning It was super busy outside and that s just the pigeons For those who may want to see the inside there is a scan on QR code for purchasing tickets and these were just over Euros Somebody else was selling fast track on the roof tickets and these were going for euros including an entry into the museum It was a bit of a hard sell so we decided not to buy any There are restaurants all around so one can never run short of things to do The toilets are just outside and they cost to use it might be wise to use one of the restaurants rest rooms if buying a drink We spent sometime just sitting outside This is a good place to relax The sightseeing buses are only a few meters away and the metro station is also just outside We spent the rest of the afternoon browsing in the Galleria Vittiro Emmanuel which is just opposite Read more Written April This

quite something from inside outside and rooftop We stayed at Sin de Ville historic hotel about min walk away I was at Segrada in Barcelona just years ago was quite in awe of that too The Duomo is reported to be largest in world None of my photos do it justice from phone camera This was of reasons we flew into Milan to start our trip We re glad we got the tickets ahead from home on official website used the lifts and did independent tour with English audioguide We had a beautiful sunny day in high s The line moved quickly and they took us a few at a time up lift Once at top you can take your time checking out the views We were able to see the city real well snow capped Alps in background We spent about minutes on roof another hour or so inside and weren t rushed at all Just be respectful No uncovered shoulders outfits above knees tanks hats inside backpacks etc They will also search purses and bags The architecture started in the and completed in is definitely a long range of various styles but overall gothic The stained glass statues etc were gorgeous We didn t pay extra to go down intro crypts The foundation original structures would of been interesting The nearby Duomo museum was included in our ticket worth the visit too Read more Written April This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC Tripadvisor performs checks

cathedrals anyway my husband isn t such a fan but we both absolutely loved the Milan Duomo We booked the combo ticket for the archaeological site the cathedral entrance and the lift to the terraces roof Wow wow and wow Inside and out underneath within on top it is spectacular Awe inspiring and just so beautiful The views of the city from the roof are a plus It takes a couple of hours for a visit and we re not dawdlers There was a bit of queue to get into the cathedral but not much of one to get into the lift to the roof But it took mins to get along the last side of the terraces roof and down the steps back to ground level And that was in a quieter beginning of Easter holiday season Worth every penny Just book it all of it Read more Written April This review is the subjective opinion of a
