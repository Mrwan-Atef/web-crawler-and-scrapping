conditions shops and galleries for a rainy day and green spaces like Yoyogi Park for when itâ s warm and sunny That said like the rest of central Tokyo be aware that things tend to get very hot and humid outside in the summer months The famous crowds in Shibuyaâ s most popular spots tend to surge on weekends â though Shibuya has a habit of feeling busy no matter when How much time should I spend in Shibuya An afternoon and evening are more than enough to cover the area around Shibuya Station where youâ ll find the iconic Shibuya Crossing the HachikÅ Statue and plenty of options for shopping and partying If you want to explore other parts of the district add a second day for a stroll along boutique lined Omotesando a look at the colorful fashions of Takeshita dÅ ri in Harajuku and a visit

in the world the first is nearby Shinjuku Shibuya Station is served by several Japan Rail lines including the Yamanote Line loop three Tokyo Metro lines and the private Keio and Tokyu railways All this means itâ s thoroughly connected to other parts of Shibuya the rest of Tokyo and effectively all of Japan You can also get straight to Shibuya from Haneda or Narita airports the Narita Express has a service that stops at Shibuya bus services also connect Shibuya and both airports Once in Shibuya itâ s easy to get around the main areas on foot although youâ ll also find plenty of taxis Top things to do in Shibuya Join the Shibuya Crossing throngs The crossing by Shibuya Stationâ s HachikÅ exit is a defining Tokyo sight Itâ s said to be the worldâ s busiest crosswalk with several thousand people converging from all directions every time the lights turn green If you want to see the crossing without the throngs head up to the open air Shibuya Sky observation deck atop the story Shibuya Scramble tower At above ground it also delivers sweeping views over the cityâ although itâ s not for anyone skittish about heights Advertisement Cat Street in Shibuya is filled with boutiques featuring indie fashion brands LilyRosePhotos Shutterstock Shop like a Shibuya teen Every day hordes of shoppers pour out of Shibuya Station breaking like a wave across the Shibuya Crossing before spreading into an ocean of stores Some will be headed for the Shibuya building where the or so small boutiques have every youthful fashion trend covered Others will be making a beeline for the pedestrian only Center gai street where high street fashions rub shoulders with colorful fast food joints Connecting Shibuya and Harajuku is Cat Street a proving ground for indie and street fashion brands Chill in Yoyogi Park Next door to Meiji jingÅ Yoyogi Park is Tokyoâ s most famous green space â a place of vast lawns and lazy afternoons where people from all walks of life come to unwind and hang out In the people watching department you can expect all types from cosplayers to dance crews to buskers and more The park also hosts all sorts of festivals from the annual Tokyo Pride in June â Japanâ s biggest LGBTIQ celebration â to the popular Thai Festival in May An exhibit at Museum Shibuya Tokyo Nina Alizada Shutterstock Check out the art and design scenes It shouldnâ t be a surprise that an area known for its fashion trends should also have a vibrant art scene In the swanky Hikarie complex by Shibuya Station the eighth floor Creative Space includes pop up contemporary art shows at the Cube gallery as well as the functional modern designs of everyday items at Museum In the backstreets of next door Harajuku a less polished option is the Design Festa gallery which has long been a champion of up and coming local artists with dozens of small gallery rooms that can be rented by the day Not that Shibuya is all about contemporary creations The Toguri Museum of Art focuses on ceramics from the Edo era while the Å ta Memorial Museum of Art not far from Harajuku Crossing houses a superb collection of woodblock prints that includes work by ukiyo e legends Katsushika Hokusai and Utagawa Hiroshige The central pavilion of Meiji jingÅ shrine Shibuya Tokyo KenSoftTH Shutterstock My favorite thing to do in Shibuya Being in my forties Iâ m painfully aware that much of the Shibuya Station area hasnâ t been geared to me for at least yearsâ and if I did start hanging out there my teenage son would be mortified to bump into me Meiji jingÅ however is a place Iâ ll never grow too old for While it justly attracts lots of visitors it still retains an air of calm and tranquility that feels deeply removed from nearby Harajuku and the youthful vibrancy of Takeshita dÅ ri In the process the complex opens a window on Japanâ s spiritual side and rituals â when for example you purify your hands before entering the sacred main compound or spot a traditional wedding procession Itâ s also free â with the exception of the Inner Garden which is well worth the small admission fee when the irises bloom in June How much money do I need for Shibuya Prices vary greatly in Shibuya High end sushi for example can easily cost you more than Â US â while a good dinner at a conveyor belt sushi chain such as Kura Sushi or Uobei could be just Â US Thanks to the areaâ s youthful focus there are plenty of deals around Itâ s always handy to carry cash in Tokyo as some restaurants and smaller stores donâ t take cards Still cashless and contactless payments are increasingly the norm You can often pay with contactless transport cards such as Pasmo and Suica and with smartphone apps like PayPay Rpay and LinePay Stores typically display the logos of accepted payment methods at the checkout area Double room at a two or three star hotel from Â US hour unlimited ride Tokyo Metro pass Â US Filtered coffee at an independent cafe from Â US One plate of sushi at Kura Sushi from Â US Admission to Shibuya Sky observation deck Â US Admission to Ota Memorial Museum of Art from Â US Admission to Design Festa free Keep the party inside For years Shibuya had been known for its popular Halloween and New Yearâ s street parties Unfortunately they got too raucous for the authorities after several years of unsuccessfully asking people to tone down their street celebrations local authorities officially banned Halloween in At the same time a year round ban on public drinking between and also came into effect in central Shibuya The famous statue of HachikÅ near Shibuya Station Tokyo Lucky mame Shutterstock Whatâ s with that dog statue near Shibuya Crossing Thatâ s HachikÅ an Akita Inu at the center of one of Japanâ s most enduring tales of loyalty Back in the HachikÅ would come to the station every day to meet his owner a professor at Tokyo Imperial University as he returned from work Until that is the professor passed away For the following decade HachikÅ still came to the station in the hope of seeing his owner â and in his own lifetime the dog became something of a celebrity his story of unwavering loyalty capturing the hearts of the Japanese
