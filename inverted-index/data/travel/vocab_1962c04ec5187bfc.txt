From route information to things to pack here s everything you need to know about trekking to Everest Base Camp Getty Images Few experiences are as humbling as standing at the foot of the worldâ s tallest mountain On the border between Tibet and Nepal Mt Everest â known as Sagarmatha in Nepali and Chomolongma or Qomolangma in the Sherpa or Tibetan language â tops out at nearly miles After trekking for at least a week to reach Everest Base Camp EBC with the prospect of more hiking days still ahead as you descend the sight of this mighty mountain surrounded by its high altitude friends is as emotional as it is beautiful While this trek takes a lot of effort some expense and a solid two week time commitment the combination of Tibetan influenced Sherpa culture good trekking infrastructure and mountain scenery grander than anywhere else on earth makes this an unmissable trail Whether youâ re a first timer to Nepal narrowing down your shortlist of possible trekking routes or a repeat visitor yet to make the pilgrimage to Base Camp you wonâ t be disappointed Here s what you need to know about trekking to Everest Base Camp in Nepal Advertisement Everest Base Camp â the tented camp used by mountaineers climbing the world s tallest mountain Slepitssskaya Shutterstock Why trek to Everest Base Camp in Nepal Mt Everest straddles the Nepal Tibet border but when people talk about trekking to Everest Base Camp they almost always mean the route in Nepal As well as having excellent infrastructure for trekkers Nepal is more open and accessible to tourists and from this side the only way to reach Base Camp is on foot or by helicopter if youâ re short on time but flush with funds A nicely paved road leads most of the way to the mountain on the Tibetan side While the unobstructed views of Everest are arguably better from the Tibetan side take it from someone whoâ s seen both thereâ s more to this trek than just the views of the mother mountain Youâ ll enjoy an unforgettable cultural experience alongside the physical challenge of one of the world s best trekking trails If youâ re a physically active outdoors loving adventurous traveler this trek ticks all the boxes The route to Everest Base Camp is well trodden but highly rewarding Bartosz Hadyniak Getty Images How long does the Everest Base Camp trek take The most commonly trekked route starts in Lukla a mountain village with a tiny airstrip served by regular turboprop flights from Kathmandu The trail meanders through Sagarmatha National Park â Nepal s highest national park â climbing steadily to EBC before returning to Lukla Itâ s an in and out route rather than a circuit and the trek typically takes to days Here s the most popular itinerary Day Fly from Kathmandu to Lukla then hike to Phakding Day Hike to Namche Bazaar feet Day Acclimatization day at Namche Bazaar Day Hike to Dingboche Day Hike to Tengboche Day Acclimatization day at Tengboche Day Hike to Lobuche Day Hike to EBC Day Begin the return trek by hiking to Tengboche Day Hike to Namche Bazaar Day Hike to Lukla Day Return by plane from Lukla to Kathmandu A map of the main routes to Everest Base Camp Daniela MachovÃ Lonely Planet Completing the route more quickly is not recommended because of the increase in altitude However there are many ways to extend the trek for an extra challenge or to get away from the crowds Here are a few options but if youâ re seeking off the beaten path adventures many trekking companies can tailor a bespoke route to suit your needs Kala Patthar Add an extra day by climbing to this viewpoint at before you begin the return trek to Lukla The degree views of Everest Lhotse Nuptse Makalu and Cho Oyu are sensational Gokyo You can detour west from EBC to the turquoise colored Gokyo Lakes some of the highest freshwater lakes in the world Returning to Lukla via the village of Gokyo will add about three days to the trek and you can summit Gokyo Ri for epic views Pioneer s Route You can skip the nail biting flight to Lukla on the old Pioneersâ Route which climbs from Bhandar or Salleri accessible by bus or from Kathmandu to Lukla over six days This was the route that early mountaineers including Sir Edmund Hillary took before the Lukla airstrip was built in the Tumlingtar to EBC For a quieter trek follow the ancient trail through Makalu Barun National Park joining the main EBC route at Lukla after about days of walking This challenging route to EBC takes about days in total starting with a flight from Kathmandu to Tumlingtar Three Passes Make a circuit of the Sagarmatha National Park on the stunning Three Passes Trek â a very challenging route for experienced hikers that crosses three of the Everest region s highest passes over about days starting on the main EBC trail Top The Pioneer s Route to Base Camp Bottom Tumlingtar to Base Camp Daniela MachovÃ Lonely Planet What to expect on the trek If this is your first trek in Nepal EBC is a great route to start with as the infrastructure is good and the views canâ t be beaten but itâ s not entirely typical of Nepal s trekking routes â many trails are much more rugged with simpler accommodation more basic food more challenging paths and far fewer travelers If youâ ve trekked elsewhere in Nepal you may be surprised by how busy the EBC route is â those photos of human traffic jams on Everest were taken at bottlenecks on the mountaineering route to the summit but even lower down the mountain there are plenty of people around Advertisement Expect to spend three to eight hours per day walking along well maintained trails though the number of hours walked each day typically decreases as you ascend Youâ ll pass through forests trace the path of the tumbling Dudh Kosi River and cross some dizzying swing bridges before reaching the horseshoe shaped hill town of Namche Bazaar â the largest settlement in Solukhumbu the local name for the Everest region After Namche the landscape becomes rockier and the mountain peaks feel much closer Along the way youâ ll pass Buddhist monasteries such as Tengboche stupas prayer wheels and walls of ceremonial mani stones bearing Tibetan inscriptions as well as the school founded by Sir Edmund Hillary at Khumjung and a small museum where you can see what some locals believe is a â realâ yeti skull The trail boasts a wide range of accommodations especially on the first few days of the trek As well as budget friendly teahouses simple lodges with restaurants offering rooms with shared bathrooms there are some luxury lodges with artful decor and gourmet meals Mountain Lodges of Nepal and Everest Summit Lodges offer high quality accommodation at matching prices While more upmarket lodges have reasonable bathroom facilities donâ t expect long hot showers every morning Your daily washing routine is more likely to involve a bucket of warmed water if youâ re lucky and a washcloth While walking the trails toilets are limited use facilities at lunch or tea stops Facilities range from rare Western style sit down toilets to Asian style squat toilets and literal holes in the ground Keep your toilet paper and soap on hand and be mindful of limited water supplies Some days are harder than others on the trek to EBC but every day involves some ascents and descents Shutterstock Is the Everest Base Camp trek hard The two week trek to EBC requires stamina but not superhuman powers Many older kids manage it for example but you ll find it easier if you re reasonably fit and have some experience of multi day mountain trekking If youâ ve never hiked in your life you may struggle but if you have a regular workout routine of some kind youâ ll probably do fine Pre trek gym based or outdoor training is a good idea Lukla â the most common starting point for the trek â sits at and youâ ll climb to at base camp The trek gets harder the higher you go because the air gets thinner and the temperatures colder especially at night The trail is steep in places and some of the earlier days are relentlessly uphill such as the climb from Phakding to Namche Bazaar at on day two of the hike Day Fly from Kathmandu to Lukla then hike to Phakding Day Hike to Namche Bazaar feet Day Acclimatization day at Namche Bazaar Day Hike to Dingboche Day Hike to Tengboche Day Acclimatization day at Tengboche Day Hike to Lobuche Day Hike to EBC Acute Mountain Sickness AMS is a risk on any trek above To give your body time to adjust acclimatization days are essential and guides will build these stops into the schedule Some people start to feel the effects of altitude above and by almost everyone will have an elevated heart rate faster breathing and maybe a headache and difficulty sleeping Some people adjust quickly to altitude but others donâ t While everybody responds to altitude differently and thereâ s no guarantee a fit traveler will withstand altitude better than their out of shape friend the overall experience tends to be easier if youâ re fit and healthy Medications such as Diamox Acetazolamide are available in Kathmandu or at home to help reduce mild symptoms as you adjust to the altitude but it s important to be alert for more serious warning signs of AMS If you feel unwell descend immediately to a lower elevation â mountain sickness can be deadly Conditions for trekking to Everest Base Camp are best from October to November and March to May Daniel Prudek Shutterstock Best Time to Trek to Everest Base Camp The peak seasons for trekking in Nepal are from October to November and March to May These are the busiest times to trek to Everest Base Camp but also the best times to go for fine weather The season for mountaineering ascents of Everest is the spring â while climbing and trekking are not the same thing the trails will be more crowded at this time as mountaineering groups also trek to EBC During the monsoon season from June to September trails can be slippery visibility poor and flights into and out of Lukla are often delayed or canceled Winter Decemberâ February is not necessarily a bad time to trek but you ll need to be well prepared for the cold Not all tour operators offer treks in winter and many businesses on the trail close but those who hit the trails can enjoy an uncrowded experience Practicalities for the trek to Everest Base Camp As of April foreign trekkers in Nepal must be accompanied by a guide on routes through the Everest region This increases the cost as prices vary depending on group size quality of accommodation and the season but it simplifies planning You can join a group trek arranged through a trekking agency or trek independently with a Nepali guide Some top Nepali run tour companies include Kathmandu based Royal Mountain Travel social enterprise Beyond the Clouds Travel and private tour specialist LaMa Walks Solo women may like to trek with a female guide â Adventure Trekking trains and employs Nepali women as guides Prices for guided treks typically include return flights between Kathmandu and Lukla trekking permits and national park fees hotel or teahouse accommodation and porters and sometimes pack animals Cheaper tours may require you to pay for some things as you go â for example food at teahouses â so these trips donâ t always work out cheaper than all inclusive tours Food costs are high in the Everest region compared to Nepal s cities as almost everything needs to be carried in by porters Permits and paperwork As well as arranging a guide trekkers need to register for a Trekkers Information Management System TIMS card administered by the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal TAAN You ll also need to pay the entry fees for Sagarmatha National Park Both can be arranged at the Tourist Service Center at Bhrikutimandap in Kathmandu Nowadays most guided tour companies take care of all your paperwork for trekking in Nepal Packing light is the key to an easy trek in the Himalayas though porters can help lighten the load Dori Moreno Getty Images An Everest Base Camp packing list When packing for your trek consider whether youâ ll be trekking with a porter as there are often restrictions on how much weight they will carry This is different from a guide who will show you the way but wonâ t carry your stuff Also consider the quality of accommodation as this will affect what you need to carry to stay warm overnight If you leave home without something you should be able to pick it up in Thamel Kathmandu s main tourist district before you start your trek Trekking poles should be considered an essential piece of kit and they can be bought inexpensively in Kathmandu Itâ s easy to spot first time trekkers in Nepal as theyâ re usually the ones without poles second timers donâ t make that mistake Hereâ s a basic list of other things to pack Sleeping bag bag liner but check what is included on any organized trek Lightweight down jacket or equivalent Waterproof jacket or a poncho Merino wool or polypropylene base layers Hiking boots â already broken in not purchased in Kathmandu â and hiking socks Clothing to wear overnight such as a tracksuit Quick drying underwear that you can handwash on acclimatization days A warm hat and a sunhat Sunglasses Personal medications and first aid items guides normally carry the basics Sunscreen Hand sanitizer and biodegradable wet wipes Bar or liquid soap Toothpaste and a toothbrush Toilet rolls or tissue packets Nail clippers and blister treatment such as sticking plasters and antiseptic ointment Advertisement Advertisement
