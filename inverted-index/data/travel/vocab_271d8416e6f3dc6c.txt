Jean Bernard Carillet Jan min read Share Bike and e bike rentals mean you can explore on two wheels saving money and avoiding tour groups at the same time Maridav Shutterstock No there s no need to remortgage the house to visit Tahiti and French Polynesia Despite a reputation for opulence and exclusivity it s perfectly possible to visit these dreamy South Pacific islands on a limited budget â if you make the right decisions Check out these tips to plan your trip to the islands without breaking the bank Daily costs Hostel room CFP US Basic room for two CFP US Basic self catering apartment including Airbnb CFP US Overwater bungalow CFP US Public transport ticket CFP US Local style baguette sandwich CFP US Dinner for two at a food truck CFP US Plan your flights in advance Book your flights to Papeâ ete early with budget airlines and keep an eye out for special offers and discounts FrenchBee and United often have great deals from the USA Travellers from Australia or New Zealand should check Air NewZealand or Air Calin for the best fares Advertisement When in the country there are two local airlines that fly between Tahiti and other islands The new kid on the block Air Moana offers cheaper airfares than rival Air Tahiti though it services fewer destinations If youâ re looking to visit multiple islands it s worth checking out Air Tahitiâ s special multi islands passes with discounts on domestic flights to two or more islands Note also that flight prices increase every school holiday and during the high season between May and October Camp on land attached to small family run guesthouses for a small fee Piotr Gatlik Shutterstock Is there affordable accommodation Glossy brochures focus on ultra swish resorts but French Polynesia actually has a pretty wide range of accommodation options You can keep lodging costs down by staying in pensions small local guesthouses that are sprinkled around the islands To book visit tahititourisme com for a list of accommodation options and contact details They re nothing glam or ostentatious just modest operations that blend perfectly into the tropical surroundings At the cheaper end of the scale around US a double they consist of simple local style bungalows with cold showers and thin walls Upmarket versions plan on US to US have lots of amenities and are more comfortable These options are generally excellent value and they offer good opportunities for cultural immersion they re mostly family run operations which ensures your money goes straight into local pockets and provide much more personal idiosyncratic experiences than hotels â the perfect island experience Many pensions are in scenic locations tucked away in greenery cloaked hills or near the ocean In the Tuamotu archipelago they feature a fab lagoon frontage â at US a double how does a bungalow facing the turquoise waters of the lagoon sound Advertisement Good news too for those who want to spend their holiday under canvas French Polynesia has a smattering of camping options around Don t expect full blown camp sites though generally it s a matter of guesthouses having areas where you can pitch your tent and allowing use of the facilities The price Around US per person Visit tahititourism com and search â campingâ to see whatâ s available Take advantage of deals for a more affordable luxe experience Shutterstock How to get deals on overwater bungalows Overwater bungalows will never be cheap but that doesnâ t mean there arenâ t deals to be had if you book in advance the earlier the better Itâ s not unusual for people to book their bungalows a year or more in advance to secure their spot and the price Travelling during the wet season November to April especially between January and March is another way to ensure a lower price point but it comes with more rain and higher temperatures Many resorts offer longer stay discounts for bookings of more than three nights as well as member discounts for those who sign up to programs offered by hotel chains this is usually free Another option to consider is booking through a travel agency as agencies often have access to better deals on this kind of accommodation for their customers And one final tip prices on overwater bungalows can change depending on their location or view For example a hotel might list a bungalow as having a view of Bora Bora island or of the lagoon Better views equal higher prices with lagoon views being the most coveted and expensive Choose the best value islands As much as Paris doesn t represent France Bora Bora Tahiti and Moâ orea the beloved islands of tour operators don t sum up French Polynesia There are about islands scattered in five archipelagoes that have tourist facilities which means that you ve got plenty of choice Consider lesser known off the radar islands which offer greater value for money A few suggestions Raiatea Tahaa in the Society islands Mataiva Tikehau in the Tuamotus Nuku Hiva Ua Huka Ua Pou in the Marquesas Raivavae and Rurutu in the Australs Join locals at Central Market Papeâ ete to buy fresh fruit vegetables and quick bites EQRoy Shutterstock How to eat cheaply It s possible to eat reasonably cheaply by patronising snack stands and food trucks roulottes and getting takeaway meals like sandwiches salads grilled fish and meat or fish burgers Most pensions offer half board bed breakfast and one other meal at around US to US per person set menu You can usually pay half board at the outset or a day or two in advance This is a fantastic way to meet locals and sample the local cuisine at economical prices Self catering can also save you a lot of money many pensions have well equipped kitchens Eating like a local is your best bet for eating cheaply Thereâ s a boulangerie on just about every island and a freshly baked baguette will set you back just US A baguette with butter and a hot drink like coffee or hot chocolate is a classic cheap Tahitian breakfast Fresh fish fruits and vegetables are easily found at roadside stalls found on most major islands Hop on an inter island ferry between Tahiti and other Society Islands to see more on a budget EQRoy Shutterstock Budget friendly ways to get around Hiring a car is expensive but it s possible to get around by bike on many islands distances are rarely great the traffic is rarely heavy and the roads are rarely hilly Bikes can be rented for less than US per day E bikes are becoming more and more popular in all the islands and can also be rented on a daily basis at around US in more heavily touristed islands Public transport is a great budget friendly option in Tahiti There are frequent buses to and from Papeâ ete during peak hours around and to on weekdays Outside of these hours buses can be unreliable The cheapest way to travel by bus is to buy a prepaid bus card available at the main bus terminal in Papeâ ete which gives you cheaper fares on all routes Otherwise itâ s best to have cash at hand for the bus Other islands such as Moâ orea also have bus routes but these can be unreliable If in doubt ask locals when the next bus comes and be prepared to wait If you re looking for adventure and have plenty of time on your hands boat travel is best for inter island travel There are frequent local ferry services between Tahiti and other Society Islands â the archipelago that includes Bora Bora and Moâ orea Local ferry companies include Vaearaâ i Aremiti and Apetahi express and the ferry terminal is located in Papeâ ete Cargo vessels serve most islands on a regular basis especially within the Society group and the Tuamotus Itâ s definitely a cheap and unique way to travel between the islands but itâ s not for the faint hearted Take it from someone whoâ s done it before travel is slow and rough and not designed for passenger comfort Spots on the vessels are often hard to get as theyâ ll go to locals first so you need to be flexible and persistent to get on Visit French Polynesia in the off season for lower prices and a more relaxed experience Martina Pellecchia Shutterstock Picking the right season It helps to travel off season prices are generally discounted and there s more chance of being able to bargain Flights are full to bursting in July and August and prices skyrocket accordingly The Christmas to New Year period is also particularly busy The best deals can often be found
