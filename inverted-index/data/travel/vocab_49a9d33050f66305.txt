Bangkok s best street food spots according to top chefs Bangkok is home to countless street food spots serving dishes ranging from noodles to spicy salads Photograph by Ulf Svane TRAVEL of Bangkok s top chefs share their favourite street food spots Bangkok is known for its street food but it s also home to innovative and delicious high end restaurants Some of the city s most exciting chefs tell us how they re shaking up Thai cuisine and their favourite hole in the wall dining spots By Chawadee Nualkhair April This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Bangkok is packed with high end restaurants dozens of which hold Michelin stars and many more of which have simply garnered loyal fan bases for their refined takes on Thai cuisine Yet the city is also inextricably linked with street food thanks to the countless carts stalls and hole in the wall that turn out flavoursome dishes from morning until night whether it s noodles curries or something else entirely It can be hard to know which street food spot to choose so we asked some of Bangkok s top fine dining chefs to tell us where they like to grab a bite when they clock off work Potong Pichaya Pam Soontornyanakij Potong has wasted no time in scooping up accolades since opening in having earned not only a Michelin star but the guide s inaugural Opening of the Year Award as well as a spot on the Asia s Best Restaurants list Driving this success is Pichaya Pam Soontornyanakij whose progressive Thai Chinese cuisine as she calls it combines traditional and modern techniques I was born into a Thai Chinese family but my culinary training was in New York and very Western style she says When it came to Potong I wanted to make something more personal The result is a reimagining of Thai Chinese dishes such as five spiced duck aged for days and roasted for minutes to create a crispy bird with intense duck flavour and frog meat encased in a bamboo lattice and paired with a clear broth It s all served up as part of a changing course tasting menu All of this takes place within a converted shophouse formerly the headquarters of Soontornyanakij s family s traditional Chinese medicine business located on an alley in Chinatown Above the restaurant on the building s top floor is Potong s cocktail bar where willing guests can try a cocktail omakase a selection of the mixologist s favourite creations Street food tip I like Sai Nam Phueng Noodle Shop s dry rice noodles with slow cooked chicken wings The noodles are cooked just right with a gooey texture and slippery mouthfeel and the chicken wings themselves are very tasty Alley between Sukhumvit Sois and Haawm Dylan Eitharong Chefs take Thai food too seriously says Dylan Eitharong Thai food isn t a mythical old man in the mountains who can only be accessed through meditation Born in Florida to a Thai father and an American mother Eitharong came to Bangkok just before the pandemic to open Haawm the supper club he runs from his home With cooking for the public temporarily not an option he used the time to deepen his Thai food knowledge One conclusion he reached Thai fine dining is a fad Despite that Eitharong s dishes made traditionally but with a hint of cheeky your grandma would never energy are decidedly elegant They include a dry tom kha gai coconut and galangal soup with chicken braised in young galangal juice and gaeng tai pla Southern Thai style fermented fish innards curry enriched with roasted coconut and a dash of coconut cream Having grown up with Thai American food in the US at some point I realised there was more to Thai food than that Eitharong says Initially inspired by recipes from and Thai women s magazines he s now finding his own style He s not chasing awards or stars but his cooking has won Haawm a loyal following And with just covers spread across part of his home he still lives upstairs this spot has become one of the city s hottest tickets Street food tip Khao Tom Jay Suay is my number one especially late night Always order stir fried pork and Chinese olives smoked duck breast add fried garlic Chinese sausage salad and khao tom rice porridge on the side Thanon Phlap Phla Chai At Jay Fat fried chicken is made to order accompanied by dishes using Thai produce such as papayas Photograph by Witchupol Charoensupaya Nawa Thai Cuisine Napol Joe Jantraget Understated yet elegant with an open kitchen at its heart Nawa Thai Cuisine is all about offering an inclusive less formal vision of fine dining where no matter how elevated we can welcome mom and dad auntie and uncle according to chef Napol Joe Jantraget Having opened the popular and more casual restaurant Samlor in Jantraget decided to return to fine dining having previously worked at Bangkok s Michelin starred I felt my job in terms of Thai food is not done yet he says Last year Jantraget opened Nawa which he runs alongside his pastry chef wife Saki Hoshino and which has already earned a star from Michelin and picked up its Opening of the Year award The innovative menu features Central Thai dishes such as Hua Hin caviar Surat Thani crab and organic pork from Nakhon Pathom It isn t afraid to tweak the classics as evidenced in dishes like ma hor traditionally sweet and salty pork paste on an acidic slab of pineapple or orange here served with different fruit depending on the season What makes ma hor is the paste That s something we d never touch says Jantraget Street food tip Jay Fat is an aharn tham sung made to order stall where they make great deep fried chicken with lots of MSG It s so wrong but so right Charoen Krung Soi Khaan Sujira Aom Pongmorn Sujira Aom Pongmorn debuted on the Bangkok dining scene like a culinary supernova becoming the first winner of Michelin s Young Chef Award in while working at high end restaurant Saawaan The chef has now brought her talents to Khaan a spot she co owns in downtown Bangkok devoted to reimagining traditional Thai cuisine The move came about after the pandemic when Pongmorn s ideas and experiences were quite different she says I wanted to move out of my comfort zone get inspiration from locals This inspiration has come from trips out of Bangkok Every weekend I go out to places like Rayong Ranong Phuket or Krabi Pongmorn says It was on one of these sojourns that the chef found inspiration for Khaan in Southern Thai cuisine It s not just spicy food there are Muslim and Chinese elements mixed cultures she says As a result many of Khaan s creations are peppered with ingredients from the south These include puu naa rice field crabs with sticky rice which Pongmorn says tells a story about how farmers use whatever they can find to create good food Street food tip Yoo Fishball is a stall open at night in Chinatown I always order sen yai nam rice noodles in a pink fermented tofu broth Yaowarat Road Charmgang is a retro style curry shop serving its fine dining spin on classic Thai curries Photograph by Zuphachai Laokunrak Charmgang Aruss Jai Lerlerstkull At Charmgang diners can hear the chefs grill chop and grind ingredients in a pestle and mortar in the open kitchen The restaurant feels informal even homely but the skill that goes into the cookery is a cut above The food is more casual but we achieve the same quality as fine dining says Aruss Jai Lerlerstkull who helms the kitchen with his wife Atcharaporn Aew Kiatthanawat But the restaurant s popularity comes down to more than just cooking it s the ambience the people Lerlerstkull says The chef who met his wife while they were working under David Thompson at Nahm launched Charmgang as a retro style curry shop A rotating menu of Thai classics shows off his knack for curries and his love of coconut I know coconut cream very well every season every taste where it comes from he says No surprise then that coconut heavy fish curry and panang curry are both permanently on the menu While these dishes seem traditional made with a passion verging on obsession according to one reviewer Lerlerstkull is happy to add his own touches such as a sprinkling of peanuts to a Penang curry After all the traditional dishes of today were the fusions of years ago he says Food always develops Street food tip I love som tam green papaya salad shops At Mae Nid Som Tum in Si Phraya I like the laab kua minced meat salad with sticky rice and tom saap spicy Isaan style clear soup with bitter bile Surawong Road close to Wat Hua Lamphong How to do it Thai Airways and Eva Air both fly nonstop from Heathrow to Bangkok
