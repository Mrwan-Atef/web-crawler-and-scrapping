Mar min read Share The timing of dinner in Spain has recently been criticized by a government minister Â Kevin Hellon Shutterstock If thereâ s one distinctive aspect of Spanish culture that stands out to tourists itâ s the tendency for activities particularly dining to occur later than in many countries Advertisement Restaurants in Spain typically donâ t open until around and even then they donâ t fill up properly until around In fact itâ s not unusual for dinners to extend to midnight and beyond Thereâ s no word for evening in Spanish and the tarde afternoon can last until or when itâ s unheard of to be out for dinner It has been that way for a long time but recently Spainâ s Second Vice President and Labor Minister Yolanda DÃ az criticized the nationâ s dining habits arguing that itâ s unreasonable for restaurants to remain open until and for work meetings to continue until She highlighted the significant difference in schedules between Spain and other European countries during a meeting with Spanish tourism leaders The minister said â It is not reasonable for Spain to be a country where we convene meetings at in the evening It is not reasonable for a country that has its restaurants open at a m â and suggested that this late night lifestyle could negatively impact the mental well being of hospitality industry workers DÃ az received a lot of backlash for her comments especially from the president of the local Madrid government Isabel DÃ az Ayuso who during the pandemic infamously kept many of the cityâ s bars and restaurants open â Spain is different â she responded on social media network X â We have the best nightlife in the world with streets full of life and freedom And that also promotes employment â In Spain em tarde em afternoon can last until or when people sometimes enjoy an aperitivo or a light bite before dinner later in the evening Â Matyas Rehak Shutterstock Why does Spain eat later than its European neighbors Spain s late dining is attributed to various factors including a workday that extends longer and later than in most European countries with businesses often closing for a few hours in the afternoon Even though according to the European Commission Spaniards work an average of hours per week which is near the EU average of hours the hours arenâ t as rigid as in other European countries Advertisement Many businesses including shops often close between and or giving Spaniards a two or three hour lunch break in which to eat their main meal of the day before returning to work to finish around By the time theyâ ve gone home after work cooked dinner or gotten ready to go out itâ s at least and the whole day has shifted Weather also plays a crucial role in Spainâ s late night dining habits Often in summer itâ s just far too hot to cook and eat when the sun is up so itâ s typical to wait until after sundown which is around People tend to work later in Spain and aren t ready to go out to restaurants until at least Â Gary Yeowell Getty Images This is also evident from the fact that dining times change across the country depending on the climate For example in AndalusÃ a in the south of Spain which has some of the hottest summer temperatures often reaching above C F bars and restaurants typically stay open until While in the Basque Country in the north of Spain which has an average summer temperature of C F bars and restaurants tend to close much earlier around It doesnâ t help that Spain is technically in the wrong time zone According to its longitude Spain should be in the same time zone as Portugal Ireland and the UK but during WWII fascist dictator Francisco Franco changed the countryâ s time to align with Hitler and Germany Comparatively dinner times in other European countries occur much earlier in the evening In the UK for example dinner is eaten around in France itâ s around and in Sweden it can be around In some parts of Spain it s simply too hot in the summer months to cook until later in the evening Â Emad Aljumah Getty Images Work life balance The Spanish schedule has drawn mixed reactions from both locals and expatriates with some appreciating the vibrant late night culture and others calling for a schedule more aligned with the rest of Europe to improve work life balance and sleep quality Mireia Goula a Catalan from Barcelona says â I think itâ s fine for restaurants to stay open until on the weekends why not â But she has a very different opinion when it comes to Spainâ s late timetable during the week â If we wake up and start work at the same as other Europeans then we should finish at the same time too â she explains â Timetables here are too late and I think we donâ t get enough sleep Sometimes itâ s very difficult to even get out to eat before â Dan Convey a Briton who lives in Spain believes that Spainâ s late night bar and restaurant culture is more civilized than back in the UK â Itâ s a lot better going out to a tapas bar or restaurant until rather than having to go to a nightclub because there are no other options open â he explains â It also means that alcohol is drunk in moderation and is always accompanied by food â A good work life balance is very important in Spanish culture and most socializing takes place around the dinner table or in restaurants Therefore when the workday is over bars and restaurants play an essential role in bringing friends and families together for as long as possible Itâ s not just about the eating people linger afterward to relax chat and enjoy drinks and coffee in whatâ s known as sobremesa Extra long lunch breaks and afternoon siestas have mostly been phased out in big companies in major cities but even so it doesnâ t seem like dining times are going to change any time soon Despite what the politicians say most Spaniards are proud of the late night dining scene and could never even imagine eating dinner at And as summers just keep getting hotter and hotter could dinners get even later Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Spain Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers
