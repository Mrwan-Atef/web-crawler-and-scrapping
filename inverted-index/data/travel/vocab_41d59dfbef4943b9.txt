get all your Nashville sightseeing done in one day is on the Old Town Trolley which travels on a continuous mile loop and stops at all of the town s most popular attractions Hop on and off whenever you want while the conductor who is also a local historian fills you in about historically important sights such as the Johnny Cash Museum the Country Music Hall of Fame Lower Broadway and the Ryman Auditorium Branch out from Broadway for a cocktail While a night out in Nashville is most closely associated with rowdy Lower Broadway escape the hordes of bachelorette parties downtown and venture out just a mile or two away to discover a range of unique bars restaurants and speakeasies in surrounding neighborhoods like The Nations Germantown and Five Points Plus drinks are significantly cheaper outside of Lower Broadway One of the best parts of Southern hospitality is cocktail culture and it s alive and thriving in Nashville so don t be scared to hit other neighborhoods and enjoy the same quality bespoke cocktail as you would get in Manhattan for half the price of a drink on Broadway Eat hot chicken and everything else Nashville hot chicken is an iconic dish to check off your list but there s so much more to the city s booming culinary scene than just Hattie B s Although the city s not officially listed in the Michelin guide there are a number of contenders serving everything
