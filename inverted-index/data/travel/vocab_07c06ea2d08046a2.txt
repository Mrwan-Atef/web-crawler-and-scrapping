How to plan a birdwatching trip to the Scottish Highlands TRAVEL Why the Scottish Highlands is the best birdwatching destination in the UK A visit to the Scottish Highlands offers one of the best bird and wildlife watching experiences in the UK with the promise of rare encounters with unique species Osprey The osprey is commonly seen hunting for fish on the larger lochs between April and August in the Scottish Highlands Photograph by Laurie Campbell Alamy By Stephen Moss June This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK The Scottish Highlands especially the Cairngorms National Park and Spey Valley has a reputation as one of the best places to go birdwatching in the UK This stunning national park is home to species that are either rare or completely absent elsewhere in the UK including the majestic golden eagle elusive capercaillie tiny crested tit and three high mountain specialists ptarmigan dotterel and snow bunting These birds aren t always easy to see you ll have to trudge up mountains walk along wooded river valleys and search through pine forests to find them all while enjoying some of the most spectacular landscape in the country Together with wonderful views excellent accommodation great places to eat and drink and the famous malt whisky the Highlands are a very enticing package to newcomers as well as experienced birdwatchers So pack your walking boots and waterproofs grab your binoculars and get twitching The mountains The Cairngorm Plateau is the only arctic alpine habitat in the British Isles which means several species that specialise in living at high altitude breed there Only one is so well adapted that it can survive on the high tops of the mountains all year round the ptarmigan whose name derives from the Scots Gaelic word for its distinctive croaking call which echoes around the spectacular scenery Actually seeing this bird can be tricky though since ptarmigan are masters of camouflage moulting into three distinct plumages in a single year including almost pure white in winter But if you sit quietly and carefully scan the rocky slopes you ll eventually see them Another much smaller bird the snow bunting spends the spring and summer on the high tops alongside the ptarmigan Each year a few pairs breed in snow filled corries sheltered dips formed by glacial erosion where they sing their tuneful song After breeding they head down the mountain some go all the way down to the coast while others stay much closer to home in the car park at the bottom of the funicular railway that takes visitors up to the top of Cairn Gorm itself Snow bunting flocks can be very tame foraging for scraps of food left deliberately or accidentally by the many visitors The third mountain speciality the dotterel is only here during the late spring and early summer months having migrated all the way from its winter home in North Africa The dotterel is a wader but with a difference unlike its marsh loving relative it breeds on the tops of mountains It also has a bizarre sex life with the more colourful and assertive females laying their clutch of eggs and then heading off to Norway to breed again This leaves the drabber male to incubate the eggs and raise the chicks A day s birdwatching on the Cairngorm Plateau may only produce half a dozen species you might also see red grouse meadow pipit wheatear ring ouzel and if you re lucky golden eagle but combined with the mountain scenery it ll certainly be a fruitful day The crested tit is confined to the woods and forests around Speyside Photograph by FLPA Alamy Forests and woods Much of the land below the plateau is covered in trees both the Scots pine and the more open birch woods These forests are full of special birds and other wildlife but can also feel as if they re totally deserted as the wild creatures that live here are very good at hiding away An early morning start on a fine calm day will help as it enables you to notice the tiny movements that give away a bird s presence in the dense foliage and also in late winter and spring hear the birdsong In the pine forests there are coal tits treecreepers and goldcrests while the crested tit more or less unique to this area of the Highlands can be hard to see Listen out for its distinctive call Siskins and chaffinches are very common and along with the various tit species will often come to bird feeders in car parks where you can get close up views and take photographs The most elusive bird of these forests is also the largest the mighty capercaillie whose name also derives from Scots Gaelic meaning horse of the woods because of its bizarre call The world s largest species of grouse the size of a turkey used to be common here but numbers have plummeted in the past few decades and birdwatchers are now asked not to go off the forest paths to search for them as they re very vulnerable to disturbance If you re very lucky you might come across one at dawn or dusk as you walk along the forest trails if so be sure to keep your distance The birch woods are easier places to watch birds listen out for the delicate song descending the scale of the willow warbler which returns here in late April all the way from Southern Africa to breed Scotland s lochs are famously known for bird and wildlife watching experiences and promises encounters with rare species Photograph by Robert Harding Alamy Rivers and lochs Speyside or Strathspey as it s known in Scotland is named after the River Spey which flows through this valley in sight of the Cairngorms As well as being a beautiful river in its own right and supplying water for some of the best malt whiskies in the world it s home to a host of birds Look out for the dipper which birdwatching hero Bill Oddie once described as like a cross between a wren and a torpedo the only British songbird that regularly submerges under water Plump and about the size of a thrush it ll bob up and down on rocks in the fast flowing river and then plunge beneath the surface to grab aquatic insects with which to feed itself and its young Two other birds also perch on rocks and bob up and down the resident grey wagtail which despite its name has bright lemon yellow underparts and the common sandpiper a smart little wader that spends the winter in Africa One species of duck the goldeneye was once only a winter visitor here but in the past few decades they ve colonised as a breeding bird Today the black and white males and grey chestnut headed females can be seen all year round Make sure you also visit some of the many lochs that are dotted around the lowlands here Special birds include the black throated diver on larger areas of water and the Slavonian grebe on smaller ones Do keep an eye out for large raptors overhead golden and white tailed eagles are regularly seen Perhaps the most famous bird of prey however is the osprey which returned to the area to breed in the and is now commonly seen hunting for fish on the larger lochs from April through to August The coast If you can tear yourself away from the rivers and lochs it s worth spending at least a day on the nearby coast Head to Spey Bay Black Isle and the Moray Firth where ducks geese and waders are the main attractions especially in winter or during the peak migration periods of spring and autumn while ospreys often hunt for fish here Target birds include the largest British duck the eider whose calls resemble a very human sounding oooh In winter there are large flocks of greylag and pink footed geese while waders such as dunlin sanderling curlew and redshank are found in huge numbers sometimes accompanied by rarer species Offshore you might also see gulls terns divers and distinctive auks such as the guillemot and razorbill Other wildlife While birds are the main attraction there are plenty of other wild creatures found here The pine woods are home to red squirrels which can be easy to spot as they clamber around the branches above your head and pine martens which are more elusive If you walk up the path to Cairn Gorm you have a very good chance of coming across our only truly montane mammal the mountain hare This animal like the ptarmigan turns almost completely white in winter Other easier to see mammals include red deer Also don t forget to check the forest floor for colonies of wood ants which emerge on a sunny day and whose colonial behaviour can be quite mesmerising to watch Published in the Lakes Mountains Collection distributed with the Jul Aug issue of National Geographic Traveller UK To subscribe to National
