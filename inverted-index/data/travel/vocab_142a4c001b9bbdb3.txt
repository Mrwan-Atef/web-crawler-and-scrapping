is the most thrilling of Rome s ancient monuments It was here that gladiators met in fierce combat and condemned prisoners fought off wild beasts in front of baying bloodthirsty crowds Two thousand years on and the seat stadium is one of Italy s top attractions drawing more than seven million visitors a year History of the Colosseum The emperor Vespasian originally commissioned the amphitheater in CE He never lived to see it finished though and it was completed by his son and successor Titus in CE To mark its inauguration Titus held games that lasted days and nights during which some animals were slaughtered The stadium was originally named the Anfiteatro Flavio Flavian Amphitheater after Vespasian s family name Flavio and although it was Rome s most fearsome venue it wasn t the biggest that was the Circo Massimo The name Colosseum which was first coined in medieval times wasn t a reference to its size but to the Colosso di Nerone a giant statue of Nero that stood nearby For some five centuries the amphitheater was used to stage gladiator games and crowd pleasing spectacles often to celebrate important anniversaries and military victories Gladiatorial combat was finally outlawed in the century but animal shows continued until the mid century Following the fall of the Roman Empire the Colosseum was largely abandoned It was used as a fortress in the century and later plundered of its precious building materials More recently pollution and traffic vibrations have taken a toll To help counter this it was given a major clean up between and the first in its year history And still today work continues on plans for a new service center and the recreation of the arena s retractable floor Crowd of visitors outside the Colosseum in Rome Italy Belenos Shutterstock What you can see from the outside Even without entering the amphitheater you can get a good look at it The outer walls which top off at ft have three levels of arches framed by columns topped by capitals of the Ionic Doric and Corinthian orders They were originally covered in travertine and marble statues filled the niches on the and stories The upper level punctuated by square window

remains of the underground areas The second floor also has a small exhibition charting the monument s history and a viewing balcony overlooking the Arco di Costantino The Colosseum s interior was originally divided into three parts the arena cavea and podium Arena The arena had a wooden floor covered in sand harena in Latin hence the word arena to prevent the combatants from slipping and to soak up spilled blood Trapdoors led down to underground chambers and passageways beneath the arena floor the hypogeum The hypogeum was the stadium s backstage area where stage sets were prepared and combatants both human and animal would gather before showtime Gladiators entered from the nearby Ludus Magnus gladiator school via an underground corridor while a second tunnel the Passaggio di Commodo Passage of Commodus allowed the emperor to arrive without having to pass through the crowds To hoist people animals and scenery up to the arena there was a sophisticated network of winch operated lifts all controlled by a single pulley system Cavea and podium The cavea for spectator seating was divided along social lines with senior officials sitting in the lowest tiers wealthy citizens in the middle and plebs in the highest sectors Women except for the Vestal Virgins were relegated to the cheapest sections at the top Tickets were numbered and spectators were assigned a precise seat in a specific sector in restorers uncovered traces of red numerals on the arches indicating how the sectors were numbered The podium a broad terrace in front of the tiers of seats was
