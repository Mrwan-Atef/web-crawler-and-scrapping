the right neighborhood for you in the huge city of Cairo with this guide to the best areas for hotels and sights Â Getty Images Home to million people magical and maddening Cairo is the largest urban area in Africa and the Middle East This huge city knows no bounds and continues to gobble up the surrounding desert â even the soon to be new capital the as yet unnamed New Administrative Capital on Cairoâ s eastern edge Advertisement Greater Cairo sprawls over more than sq miles meaning that itâ s important for travelers to choose wisely when it comes to deciding where to stay and how to spend their days on a trip to the Egyptian capital Here are the best neighborhoods in Cairo for accommodations activities and more Stay in Downtown Cairo for easy access to the Egyptian Museum Â Ahmed Alattar Shutterstock Downtown Cairo and Garden City Best neighborhood for hotels Equidistant from Cairo International Airport and the Pyramids of Giza the Nile side neighborhood of Downtown Cairo sits at the heart of the action The focal point of the area is the Egyptian Museum the historic salmon pink palace stuffed full of treasures on Tahrir Sq This district is a veritable buffet of great cheap eats and authentic Egyptian street food â if youâ re not sure where to start chowing down sign up for the Downtown Cairo Food Tour with Bellies En Route Along the river south of downtown is Garden City developed in the early century and modelled after an English suburb In both areas upscale international chain hotels line the river banks â the Nile Ritz Carlton is a particularly good choice for easy access to the Egyptian Museum as it nearly backs onto the museum entrance Giza Best neighborhood for visiting the Pyramids Though this area is often what travelers first think of when they imagine Cairo Giza is technically a separate governorate encompassing the land on the western side of the Nile The iconic Pyramids of Giza understandably absorb most travelersâ time and the pyramids at Saqqara and Dahshur â which are even older than those at Giza â are also within easy reach With more European flights landing at Sphinx International Airport and the soon to open Grand Egyptian Museum Giza is set to see an even bigger boost in visitor numbers Advertisement However the hotels in Giza are mostly lackluster with the exception of the historic digs at Mena House Constructed in as a hunting lodge for Khedive Ismail this spot has close up views of the pyramids from the pool restaurant and â if youâ re willing to shell out for it â your room Stop for a coffee at Fishawi s in Islamic Cairo home to Khan Al Khalili market Â Getty Images Islamic Cairo Best neighborhood for stepping back in time Despite its name Islamic Cairo is not necessarily more religious than other neighborhoods â its name comes from its position as one of the power centers of Egyptâ s many Islamic empires This district has a wonderful concentration of mosques madrassas religious schools and historic Arab architecture and is certainly a big contributor to Cairoâ s nickname of the â city of a thousand minarets â Get lost in the labyrinthine lanes of Khan Al Khalili Cairoâ s medieval market that promises to bend and maybe break your sense of direction Make a coffee or mint tea stop at Fishawiâ s open since the time of Napoleon with copper top tables and patina dotted wall mirrors See the scene from above by climbing up Bab Zuweila an century gate that once guarded the old walled city Continue your admiration of architecture at the magnificent Mosque Madrassa of Sultan Hassan and from the hilltop perch of the Citadel Gezira and Zamalek Best neighborhood for a quieter â but still central â Cairo Chaos runs in Cairoâ s DNA but for a slightly calmer experience stay on Gezira an oblong island in the Nile Originally developed by Khedive Ismail in the late as his private residence and gardens â his palace is now the Cairo Marriott Hotel Omar Khayyam Casino which retains many stunning architectural features such as the arched entryway and grand staircase â this district is now a hub for expats and embassies Zamalek the leafy district on the northern side of the island is an artsy enclave with a cluster of galleries and the Aisha Fahmy Palace a cultural center housed inside an elegant mansion of frescoes and fireplaces built for a century Egyptian aristocrat Coptic Cairo and Fustat are home to some of Cairo s oldest religious buildings Â akimov konstantin Shutterstock Coptic Cairo and Fustat Best neighborhood for Cairo old and new Some of Cairoâ s southern neighborhoods are engaged in a tug of war the eternal battle of history and heritage versus hip new happenings Fustat is the oldest urban area of Cairo and it was the countryâ s capital after the Arab conquest of Egypt in CE Many of the gems of the next door neighborhood of Coptic Cairo are enclosed within the walls of an ancient Roman fortress called Babylon including the Coptic Museum the Church of St George and the Hanging Church In these neighborhoods travelers can visit Cairoâ s oldest church oldest mosque and oldest synagogue but parts of Fustat and Coptic Cairo are in the crosshairs of bulldozers and new development A cache of royal mummies was transported from the Egyptian Museum to the newly opened National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in with huge pomp and circumstance in nitrogen filled capsules aboard specially designed vehicles made to look like ancient Egyptian funerary boats Meanwhile other important modern cultural spots such as the wonderful arts center Darb are at risk of being controversially cleared away in the name of â new â Donâ t miss the pottery workshops photography courses and the rest of the creative program on your visit Heliopolis Best neighborhood for staying close to Cairo International Airport If youâ re making only a flying visit to Cairo â or if youâ re in town longer term and prefer a quieter suburb â Heliopolis makes a good alternative to staying central Established in by Belgian industrialist and railroad baron Ã douard Empain Heliopolis was conceived as a â garden cityâ for the colonial officials ruling Egypt and today it knocks at the entrance to Cairo International Airport Impressive hotels continue to pop up here including the opened Waldorf Astoria the first from the brand on the African continent Heliopolis is a long way from Cairoâ s main tourist attractions but it has a few sights up its sleeve The unique style of the neighborhood blends European neoclassical architectural elements such as grand avenues and arcades with Egyptian North African and Persian features including wooden balconies and arched windows The Egyptian president has had an office here in the building that was formerly Empainâ s Heliopolis Palace Hotel since the Thatâ s off limits to the public but you can peek inside Empainâ s eccentric mansion inspired by the temples of Angkor Wat Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a
