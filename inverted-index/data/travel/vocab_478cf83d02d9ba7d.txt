how Costa Rica s capital became cool Robert Isenberg Dec min read Share There you are playing table tennis with a stranger in the middle of a park All around you loom primeval trees festooned with vines Around noon you amble over to the century old National Theater for a free performance of the National Symphony Orchestra Feeling famished you visit a posh new gastropub to sample their gourmet sliders followed by pints of craft beer By youâ re watching a local indie band perform in three languages Advertisement Can this really be San JosÃ When did the dark rainy confusing capital of Costa Rica become so cool For years â Chepeâ has been a backpackersâ purgatory a necessary layover before hopping a bus to greener destinations Oh San JosÃ is still gritty and a world apart from Costa Ricaâ s beaches and cloud forests But in recent years the city has experienced a slow renaissance Forgotten barrios are blossoming At long last urban Ticos are starting to feel a tinge of pride So donâ t write off San JosÃ just yet Thanks to a surge of artists foodies and entrepreneurs the city can be downright fun Here are some new and exciting reasons to pencil in a couple of extra days during your trip Orientation The throbbing heart of San JosÃ is its downtown area a hodgepodge of tiny neighborhoods that are walkable and well connected by buses and taxis Note that neighborhoods are poorly marked and seem to overlap and street addresses are useless But any chepeÃ o San JosÃ resident can direct you to the most exciting zones Barrio is a sloped historic neighborhood with galleries cafÃ s and novelty shops Barrio Escalante has wide streets and rows of stately houses and inventive restaurants San Pedro is home to the University of Costa Rica and a thriving party scene Paseo is named after a long avenue that leads to La Sabana Park which offers a mix of hostels chain restaurants and exciting new pubs At first glance Los Yoses seems to be just a highway connecting downtown San JosÃ to San Pedro but a stroll down its back streets reveals some of the most popular venues in the city Food and drink renaissance In the sprawl of San JosÃ most tourists have to choose between gallo pinto rice and beans and Pizza Hut But venture down the right thoroughfare and youâ ll find a cornucopia of options For a luxurious lunch try KalÃº Barrio Escalante a brightly lit bistro serving up gourmet coffee elaborate pasta bowls and salads combined with a boutique shop hawking ceramic plates CafÃ Rojo Barrio is built into an old house with hardwood floors and bossa nova on the stereo the rotating menu has permanent delights like hibiscus tea and deli sandwiches on artisanal bread ChepeÃ os are now spoilt for dinner options but a downtown favorite is AquÃ Es Paseo â a romantically lit Argentinean steakhouse Advertisement Costa Ricaâ s craft beer revolution is creating quite a buzz about town with an explosion of breweries like Perro Vida Treintaycinco and the Costa Rica Craft Brewing Co providing new ammunition for a San JosÃ night out If you love something hoppy and strong start with a Libertas or the powerful Maldita Vida Both beers are rich tasty and easy to find For the first time in Costa Rican history scruffy youths are now conversant in cervezas artesanales A clutch of hotspots are making it their business to help you sample this rapidly evolving beer scene Try Stiefel Pub Barrio a two story dive with tile floors and tables decorated in pop art or El Gaff Los Yoses an expansive eatery with multiple patios and complex pizzas Because San JosÃ is such a condensed city all these places are an inexpensive taxi ride away from any downtown hostel Bars generally close between midnight and when cabs are strongly recommended Free art and entertainment Upbeat municipal events are becoming popular in San JosÃ thanks to a new generation of ambitious bohemians and their stubborn love for the city The quarterly Art City Tour has become one of the most popular civic events in Costa Rica During the tour which is completely free local museums and galleries open their doors to the public and free shuttles transport patrons from one cultural hub to the next Organized by GAM Cultural Art City floods San JosÃ with energetic youths culminating in free concerts and block parties This event is the best way to enjoy San JosÃ â s full range of art venues curious visitors queue downtown outside Museo de Jade a newly expanded four story colossus that houses one of the largest collections of pre Columbian art and jade in the world Meanwhile guests can also sip wine outside TEOR Ã Tica Gallery a plucky little art space in Barrio If you canâ t time a visit around one of these tours itâ s worth checking out the rest of GAM Culturalâ s exhaustive cultural calendar Another curious cultural phenomenon is Enamorate de tu Ciudad Fall in Love with Your City an ongoing series of workshops and performances in urban parks hosted by the Culture Ministry Enamorate events are also public and free During weekends La Sabana Park comes alive with pickup soccer games jogging groups and massive zumba classes involving hundreds of people Just wander around San JosÃ â s version of Central Park and ask to join any activity that strikes your fancy Keep an eye out for colorful public murals which pop up in neighborhoods like San Pedro and Barrio Imaginative and sometimes psychedelic these paintings depict everything from jungle scenes to famous buskers Central Avenue even has paintings on the garage doors of its shops which appear when shopkeepers close for the night Music revolution Sure you can still find salsa clubs and dive bars with disco floors in San JosÃ but if youâ re after something more eclectic or discerning San JosÃ may surprise you Music fans will gravitate toward the Hoxton Pub Los Yoses which has the air of a private mansion overrun by hipsters You can usually catch a singer songwriter at the gypsy style CafÃ de los Deseos Barrio Carmen Big and famous bands like Tico superstars SonÃ mbulo Psicotropical usually play at places like Mundo Loco El Chante San Pedro or Jazz CafÃ San Pedro All these venues double as bars and serve upscale pub food Concert schedules are scattered and unpredictable but most venues announce upcoming acts on their Facebook pages A rule of thumb is that a Costa Rican concert will almost never start on time and while most are slated for to they generally start an hour or two late Covers can be pricey for Latin America ranging from to but the atmosphere is usually worth it One of the most experimental venues in San JosÃ is AmonSolar Barrio a large Romanesque structure that houses a restaurant a large main stage and â El the basement a subterranean speakeasy for jazz players AmonSolar hosts all kinds of visual and performing artists and the endless cycle of blues and jazz performances gives new meaning to Costa Ricaâ s famed pura vida the pure life This article was
