This animal sanctuary lets you track rare rhinos on foot in Kenya TRAVEL This animal sanctuary lets you track rare rhinos on foot in Kenya The secluded Samburu conservancy is the first of its kind in the region and every step supports conservation efforts and local communities The acre Sera Rhino Sanctury is the first an only community managed black rhino sactuary in East Africa and the only site in Northern Africa where visitors can track both black and white rhinos on foot Photograph By David Chancellor Nat Geo Image Collection By Bianca Bujan April Sand sifts through the fingers of Jimmy Lekiondo a Samburu safari guide at Saruni Rhino who specializes in rhino tracking It blows to the ground as he scans the trees with squinted eyes Noticing my curiosity he whispers Rhinos can t see well but are very sensitive to smell We do this to ensure they don t catch our scent Motioning for me to follow he cautions Walk lightly Rhinos are also highly sensitive to sound There Lekiondo stops and suddenly points Between the bushes I see what looks like a giant grey boulder Then it moves A massive southern white rhino stands Startled by its size I leap behind Lekiondo spooking the rhino which bolts in the opposite direction Never move until I say he warns clearly frustrated In this environment following instructions is critical Until that moment I hadn t realized white rhinos are actually grey the name comes from the width of their mouth or just how massive they are the second largest land mammals on Earth after the African elephant Our tracking experience is as real as it gets For hours we trek through the bush as Lekiondo follows footprints dissects dung piles and flings sand to gauge the wind s direction We re searching for the elusive black and white rhinos that roam the hectares acres of the Sera Rhino Sanctuary within Samburu s Sera Conservancy I am one of two guests on this riveting rhino trek led by Lekiondo and two armed rangers This is the first and only community managed black rhino sanctuary in East Africa and the only site in Northern Kenya where visitors can track both black and white rhinos on foot I take comfort in knowing that every step taken here not only brings me closer to these endangered animals but also supports their survival and the communities dedicated to their protection Adventurous travelers visit the Sera Rhino Sanctuary located within Samburu s Sera Conservancy not only for the thrill of tracking rhinos on foot but also because they know their stay directly supports conservervation and community projects Photorgaph By Biran Siambi Saruni Basecamp From poaching to preservation Until February white rhinos had never roamed Samburu they are native to South Africa Namibia and Zimbabwe Last year four adult southern white rhinos two males and two females were translocated from Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to Sera marking the first ever presence of white rhinos in the region This initiative builds on Sera s success in reintroducing black rhinos to Samburu Before their translocation in black rhinos hadn t been seen in Samburu since the late according to Albert Leturuka Sera Rhino Sanctuary Manager Historically black rhinos roamed the region for thousands of years but were wiped out by poaching Nearly years later thanks to Sera s pioneering efforts not only reintroducing the species to Samburu but incorporating a community centric conservation model establishing wildlife corridors to counter human wildlife conflict and facilitate the free movement of other wildlife and employing advanced monitoring and notching techniques to rigorously track the species the black rhinos are back and thriving Rhino poaching may sound like an archaic problem but it s a concern even today In alone rhinos have been poached from South Africa s Kruger National Park with incidents occurring at the same location in Rhino translocations reduce overpopulation resource competition and threats in high density areas Since their arrival Sera has seen zero poaching incidents and a percent population increase from black and white rhinos to black adults young and white including a newborn And it s not just about the rhinos these efforts are directly supporting the local community too Related This is the only place on Earth where lions live alone Connecting conservation and community All Sera Conservancy rangers and staff are local like Albert I m from the Seriolipi Group Ranch says Albert I understand the landscape I ve been looking after animals here since childhood This lifelong connection makes the team invaluable to the sanctuary They re personally invested in conservation and see direct benefits in their communities Albert attributes Sera s success to community involvement Through the Basecamp Explorer Foundation the non profit arm of Saruni Basecamp and conservancy fees social services like medical benefits school scholarships water access employment and transportation to clinics are provided The relationship has created a sense of this is ours within the local community he explains Decisions are made through a citizen board so the community has a voice in decision making Svein Wilhelmsen founder and chair of Saruni Basecamp emphasizes their commitment to Sera s mission We really want to support the initiative of the rhino sanctuary because we think it s so important for stability and the local community he says It s about balancing commercial viability with job creation Guests staying at the small community owned Saruni Rhino lodge can stay in four bandas or

rangers and accustomed to human interaction Born at Sera to mother Nairenyu and father Loeku he was the second rhino born here post translocation At two days old a ranger found him alone likely abandoned Without milk he was in danger Albert explains Loijipu was flown to Reteti Elephant Orphanage in northern Kenya where he was nursed alongside elephant calves for nine months before returning to Sera Unable to reintegrate with wild rhinos he now lives in a designated space within the sanctuary cared for by dedicated rangers The best time to visit is during Kenya s dry season June to October and December to March and rhino tracking usually takes place early in the morning to avoid the midday heat To access this experience visitors will first need to fly into Nairobi and then fly by small bush plane to Samburu followed by a two hour scenic drive to the remote conservancy A two night stay at Saruni Rhino grants exclusive access to the Sera Rhino Sanctuary and its on foot rhino tracking experience While there guests can even stay in a banda named after Loijipu a cozy cottage overlooking a dry riverbed Afternoons offer game drives village visits or riverbed walks followed by refreshing dips in the pool or naps under the shade of swaying palms and thorny acacias From here you may spot some of Samburu s most spectacular wildlife such as the Samburu Special Five which include the reticulated giraffe Grevy s zebra Beisa oryx Somali ostrich and gerenuk These special sightings add to the draw of the more commonly sought after Big Five sightings which can also be found
