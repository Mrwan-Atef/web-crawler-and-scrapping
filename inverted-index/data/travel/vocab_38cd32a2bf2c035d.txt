destination and the right ship and line for your travel style The cruise line makes it simple offering packages to help you save on extras like alcohol shore tours or even airfare Travelers say they choose to cruise because cruising often costs less per night when compared with land vacations at a hotel where they ll have to book and pay for every extra What are Tips for Finding Cheap Cruises If you re a flexible traveler you ll have a better chance of finding cheap cruises Take a cruise that doesn t sail over the summer or holidays when prices are highest Book an inside cabin or take your chances with a guarantee cabin ideal for passengers who aren t picky about their stateroom location but really want the lowest price available Book cabins on lower decks which often come with lower prices than those rooms on higher floors that is staterooms over suites Cruise brands such as Carnival Cruise Line MSC Cruises Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International offer rates that might drop as low as per person per night and sometimes even lower If you want a real bargain consider a transatlantic or repositioning cruise These cruises are one way or open jaw trips that start in one port and finish at another You can score a deal sailing from Florida to Europe for example or even from New York to Florida Just be aware you ll probably have to pay a bit more for airfare to return What are Tips to Finding Last Minute Cruise Deals While being flexible date wise will always get you the best last minute cruise deals it s particularly helpful if you live near a cruise port and can quickly drive there That way you ll probably be able to jump on those deals that might pop up just a week or two before the ship is scheduled to sail Or if you don t have flexibility with either departure dates or embarkation locations be willing to compromise on exact destinations This will allow you to find a wider range of last minute deals traveling to locations in their off season or so called shoulder season Do plenty of research and know what your ideal cruise is and costs on average so both are already on your radar When you see it drop pounce Many cruise lines update pricing several times per day so preparation is crucial Best cruises in There s truly a cruise style and ship for everyone and that has never been more the case than in as vessels continue to come in an array of sizes from riverboats and expedition vessels to the largest ever mega ships And it s not an exaggeration to say some are loaded with so many activities that you couldn t possibly enjoy them all in a single sailing Families will find plenty of options and activities onboard big ships which have transformed cruising making the vessels as exciting as the destinations themselves The Caribbean is always a great option for families offering lots of sunshine great beaches and culture Alaska famous for its incredible vistas and abundant wildlife is also a solid family cruise option Consider cruise brands such as Carnival Cruise Line Princess Cruises Royal Caribbean International Norwegian Cruise Line Disney Cruise Line MSC Cruises and even Celebrity Cruises and Holland America Line for a great multi generational voyage Or on the smaller side by comparison river cruising remains a hot ticket item this year with exciting routes that send eager guests down the Danube or Rhine rivers in Europe or to lesser frequented locations like the Mekong River in Cambodia or Vietnam or soon the Magdalena River in Colombia Popular river cruises embark in timeless cities like Amsterdam Budapest and Lisbon River cruise lines to consider encompass Viking AmaWaterways Avalon Waterways Scenic Luxury Cruises Tours Emerald Cruises Tauck Uniworld Boutique River Cruises and Riverside Luxury Cruises as well as American Cruise Lines for a domestic alternative If you re an adventurer at heart an expedition cruise might be best for you These voyages often onboard small ships only a few hundred passengers tops offer an intimate experience that brings passengers right up next to glaciers whales penguins and iguanas Ships visit tiny spots all over the world from pole to pole including the Arctic Alaska Australia Greenland the Galapagos and of course Antarctica Passengers will spend their time zodiacing kayaking hiking biking and exploring with expert guides and knowledgeable naturalists Expedition travelers love cruise lines such as Lindblad Expeditions National Geographic UnCruise Adventures Silversea HX formerly Hurtigruten Expeditions Ponant and Quark Expeditions as well as an ever expanding list that now even extends to Seabourn and Viking But for the most decadent form of travel luxury cruises offer all inclusive experiences onboard small to median sized ships usually under a thousand passengers with perks like butlers high end amenities and personalized intuitive service not to mention the finest dining at sea Ships often feature luxury touches like marble and crystal decor intimate spaces and beautiful spas Because luxury ships tend to be on the smaller size they can often reach off the beaten path destinations bigger ships simply cannot access ports like St Tropez or Guadeloupe If you re looking for a luxury cruise consider Crystal Seabourn Regent Seven Seas Cruises Silversea Explora Journeys Scenic Luxury Cruises Tours The Ritz Carlton Yacht
