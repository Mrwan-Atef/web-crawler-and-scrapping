Philippines which incredible Asian country is right for you Kara Santos Marisa Megan Paska Feb min read Share The glorious beaches the Philippines or the elephants of Sri Lanka Â Stocksy Getty Images As the northern hemisphere winter drags on dreams of your next beach vacation grow more acute Why not dare to dream big with an extended trip to somewhere truly new Savvy travelers have long identified Sri Lanka and the Philippines as two of Asiaâ s most fabulous destinations Both have alluring white sands exciting natural attractions and delicious cuisine a combination that will enchant even the most jaded visitor Yet how does one pick between these two places Stepping up to the challenge are a dueling duo of writers keen to sing the praises of their preferred place and help you make this most difficult yet wonderful of decisions Prepare to be enchanted by wild and wonderful Sri Lanka Marisa Megan Paska is a travel journalist who has motorbiked surfed and stared lovingly at elephants all over Sri Lanka Her son even once joined a local preschool inside a Buddhist monastery Advertisement What I remember most from my first visit are the elephants Wild elephants How was it possible that on an island roughly the size of Ireland wild elephants were blocking the road As I watched the gentle giants amble across the tarmac in front of our car I was captivated Sri Lanka an island of elephants Later on a safari drive through Yala National Park I discovered that not only elephants roamed here There are also leopards sloth bears saltwater crocodiles and three types of monkey And that was only on land A surfer mastering a wave on Mirissa Beach Matthew Williams Ellis Getty Images We surfed along Sri Lankaâ s crystal clear reefs in Ahangama and Hiriketiya with dolphins and sea turtles later learning that five species of sea turtles roost on Sri Lankaâ s western shores then took a boat ride off the coast of Mirissa to see majestic migrating blue whales Sri Lanka is packed with an ecological diversity Iâ d rarely experienced on such a small mass of land Only half the size of England and with a population just twice that of Portugal Sri Lanka is but a teardrop island floating in the Indian Ocean Yet in a blink of an eye this gemstone laden well gem had swept me off my feet Back before it was one of the most sought after train journeys in the world I sat in a rust red colored car as it chugged along toward the mountain town of Ella via incredible feats of engineering like the Nine Arch Bridge and the Demodara Loop The click clacking lulled me into a meditative state as we traversed endless fields and tea plantations where breathtaking views of green hills and valleys unfolded across the hill country Climbing up the steps to the Bahiravokanda Viharaya Temple Getty Images At the other end of the train line we found the sacred city of Kandy a UNESCO site whose Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic attracts Buddhist pilgrims from around the world The sacred city is perhaps only outdone by an ancient one to the north Sigiriya a rock fortress that once served as Sri Lankaâ s original capital and is today seen as a marvel of human engineering My preferred type of pilgrimage site however sit at the tops of mountains For instance a five hour climb up Adamâ s Peak rewards hikers with a truly inspiring sunrise view stretching across nearly the entire southern half of the island The two day trek to the top of the Knuckles Mountain Range also amazes Advertisement Thereâ s also something quasi spiritual in that first sip of Ceylon tea carefully picked from the upcountryâ s sprawling plantations where many colonial estates have become boutique hotels Or in the sunrise seen from Elephant Rock in Arugam Bay a small town on the islandâ s quieter less visited East coast so full of untouched nature great waves and incredible people The rolling green hills of the tea plantations near Haputale Shutterstock Indeed itâ s the people who really keep me coming back to this stunning nation Like the family who cooked me and my son hoppers bowl shaped pancakes and dal curry for breakfast every day for a month the schoolteacher who invited my blond toddler to join the local preschool at the townâ s monastery the tuk tuk driver who explained all of his familyâ s religious traditions to me while giving me an impromptu tour of his favorite Buddhist monastery Each one shared their life story and culture out of the pure joy that comes from sharing something you truly love This often includes sharing culinary stylings While the country is majority Buddhist the Muslim Hindu and Christian communities each have their own traditions and unique culinary specialties A Sri Lankan lamprais â rice meat and vegetables baked in a banana leaf Getty Images Your mouth will start watering as you dig your fingers in Sri Lanka itâ s polite to eat with your right hand into a banana leaf wrapped lamprais rice meat and vegetables baked in a banana leaf a Tamil vegetarian curry from the north or a biryani a speciality of the islandâ s Muslim population My favorite Sri Lankan moment Slipping away to a quiet corner of one of the lesser visited white sand beaches along the southern coastline There I can float the day away in palm tree lined paradise stopping only for a fresh thambili king coconut and a perfectly spicy rice and fish curry lunch always with plenty of coconut sambol â a typically tasty Sri Lankan moment The fabulous Philippines will win your heart every time A freelance writer and Lonely Planet guidebook contributor from the Philippines Kara Santos has traveled to all of the countryâ s provinces preferring to explore each destination on two wheels Sri Lankaâ s beaches are nice sure But with more than islands and the fifth longest total coastline in the world the Philippines has the clear edge In fact if youâ re into sand surf and the underwater kaleidoscope of coral reefs itâ s really a no brainer But donâ t take my word for it Listen to the beach and island experts who keep voting some of our isles as some of the worldâ s best beach and dive destinations You can walk barefoot on Boracay â s sugary sands and choose between your pick of open air seafood barbecues or fine dining restaurants Limestone cliffs tower over Hidden Beach on Matinloc Island in Palawan Simon Dannhauer Shutterstock You can also stray off the beaten path and discover thousands of other islands and beaches that are just as charming with no other tourists in sight Chill on the shores of Pagudpud up north or party with surfers down in Siargao in southern Mindanao You can also live out your mermaid dreams swimming right next to sea turtles manta rays and whale sharks in the Visayas And Palawan â s towering limestone cliffs jut from crystal blue waters never failing to leave even the most jaded global backpackers in awe Did I mention coral reefs Diving in other places will feel like watching an old black and white film compared to the immersive vividness of the countryâ s lush coral gardens In some dive spots the explosion of colors spectacular marine life and shipwrecks below remain visible through crystalline waters even if youâ re just snorkeling near the surface If you d like a bit more adventure opt for liveaboard diving trips to remote tropical islands near the ridiculously clear waters of Linapacan take the plunge in the UNESCO designated Tubbataha Reefs a global center of marine biodiversity or explore Apo Reef the worldâ s second largest contiguous coral reef system A sea snake swims past a diver at the coral reef near Apo Island Getty Images I once spent a week sailing around Culion Island staying in huts and tents on random beaches Our guide would buy fresh seafood from local fishermen to grill for dinner and weâ d lounge on hammocks sipping on fresh coconuts while watching the fiery sunset Pure bliss Another time we rented motorcycles to drive to San Vicente Palawan and had the entire long miles stretch of the countryâ s longest white sand beach all to ourselves The perfectly formed volcanic cone of Mt Mayon John Kevin Getty Images Itâ s not all beaches here though If you prefer mountain scenery Bicol â s Mt Mayon the worldâ s most perfect volcanic cone is yours to admire Mt Pulag is surrounded by a famed sea of clouds and offers otherworldly views of the Milky Way at dawn The century old rice terraces of Banaue and Batad carved into the Cordillera Mountains draw trekkers from all over the world Even Thanos was spotted trying to live in peace there after the snap at the end of Avengers Infinity War With its chilly mountain weather and a culture that has preserved its Indigenous ways amid pine forests Sagada is a personal favorite Halfway to Taiwan Batanes also deserves a spot on your Philippines bucket list with rolling green hills sheer cliffs and boulder beaches this province has some of the most achingly scenic islands you may ever see Dancers dressed in colorful costumes for the Dinagyang Festival Kobby Dagan VWPics Universal Images Group Getty Images Sure Sri Lanka might have the upper hand when it comes to ancient culture and history â but the Philippines rules when it comes to festivities and fun loving crowds Thereâ s a festival taking place no matter what time of year you visit and visitors universally enjoy a warm welcome â and plenty of food Who needs tea plantations when you have all you can eat tropical fruits and fresh seafood infused with diverse flavors that mix Indigenous Spanish Chinese and Western cuisines Take a bite of crispy roast suckling pig called the â best pig everâ by Anthony Bourdain pair your sisig sizzling grilled pieces of pork with ice cold beer and heap on the extra rice with local favorites adobo stewed chicken or pork marinated in vinegar and garlic sinigang sour tamarind flavoured soup and kare kare meat cooked in peanut sauce Since variety is the true spice of life you can easily get pizza and burgers too if you need comfort food Smiles greet you wherever you go as you savor sun kissed island living with your feet in the sand sipping a frosty fruit shake in the company of new friends Filipinos are extremely friendly and fluent in English too So when you strike up a conversation expect an invitation to share drinks with locals The Filipino people as much as their enchanting
