of empty corridors The eerie Winchester House was one of the first to draw tourists seeking spine chilling thrills At the elaborate Grand Ballroom at the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose California cost more than three times the price of an entire home in the late The Queen Anne style mansion was one of the inspirations for author Shirley Jackson s influential horror novel The Haunting of Hill House and is one of many historic homes that offer tours Photograph by Winchester Mystery House LLC By Roger Luckhurst October min read Soon after the death of Sarah Winchester in San Jose California in the new owners opened her mansion as an attraction for tourists drawn to tales of the bizarre Winchester was the heir to the gun manufacturer s fortune and rumors swirled around her constant home building and renovation She constructed elaborate extra rooms more than a hundred stairs that led nowhere and empty corridors that turned the house into a bewildering maze Was her fortune cursed Did Winchester build a labyrinth to confound vengeful spirits Were there séances held in the mansion every night The answer was no to most of these questions but once the famous magician Harry Houdini visited and told the owners to market it as the Winchester Mystery House its commercial career was secure It has just celebrated its centenary and is still a popular attraction in the San Francisco Bay Area You can take the Walk with Spirits tour attend a séance or new this fall immerse yourself in creepy Unhinged Housewarming evenings The mansion was one of the inspirations for Shirley Jackson s classic novel The Haunting of Hill House a key gothic novel that portrays a house as a reserve of malignant energy The famous opening paragraph tells us that the house stood by itself against its hills holding darkness within In the novel a group of paranormal investigators stay in the house which they only belatedly realize is feeding off disturbed psychic powers that are conjuring murderous long buried resentments Ever since the book s success and thanks to Stephen King novels true paranormal TV shows and found footage films such as Paranormal Activity we ve become attuned to the idea of the Bad Place the house where past traumas or atrocities have leaked into the atmosphere and then gotten stuck on repeat Here s how Jackson s book continues to inspire haunted house tourism and where you can visit other evocative Bad Places Set on a lake in Oxfordshire England Blenheim Palace made a suitably chilling location for the film The Legend of Hell House inspired by Shirley Jackson s gothic novel Photograph by Andreas von Einsiedel Getty Images The legacy of Hill House In the preface to her bestseller Jackson confessed the idea for her ghost story had been taken from a bizarre true life inquiry by the London based Society for Psychical Research in The Society which still exists formed a Haunted House Committee and sent the dubious psychic sensitive Ada Goodrich Freer to investigate claims of haunting at Ballechin House in Scotland The book of the investigation given aristocratic endorsement by the Marquis of Bute caused all sorts of ructions in the Letters pages of the London Times with many condemning the naivety of the investigators Ghost stories scare up new life at these historic hotels Jackson s novel was filmed in to great effect as The Haunting Director Robert Wise used Ettington Park Hall in Warwickshire in the United Kingdom for the unnerving exteriors The Hall was the ancient estate of the Shirley family stretching back to the Domesday Book but it was rebuilt in the century in the neo Gothic style all pointed arches and polychromatic brickwork Some claim the Hall actually is haunted being such an old family pile in Shakespeare country An elderly Victorian ghost totters around at twilight while Lady Emma is said to glide through the corridors at night However as a current star hotel popular with wedding parties it now doesn t play up that angle Also inspired by Jackson s book the film The Legend of Hell House featured the sharp angled baroque details of Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire The palace was built by the architect and playwright Sir John Vanbrugh for the British hero the Duke of Marlborough who had won a famous victory at the Battle of Blenheim in The grand house was the birthplace of the first Duke s most famous descendant and another war hero Winston Churchill For the recent Netflix series freely adapted from The Haunting of Hill House director Mike Flanagan used the Gothic exterior of Bisham Manor in Lagrange Georgia This mansion in private hands does look suitably Gothic but is actually less than years old In the mountains of Transylvania Romania Bran Castle markets itself as Dracula s Castle capitalizing on the brooding setting of Bram Stoker s novel Dracula Photograph by Sean Gallup Getty Images Vampire castles and other Gothic spaces For the more adventurous admirer of Gothic novels and haunted houses Bran Castle in Transylvania Romania claims to be the inspiration for the brooding opening section of Bram Stoker s novel Dracula Stoker never visited the region but constructed the vampire s den from travel books conversations with his brother who had journeyed in the Balkans and his fevered imagination Inside the fortress known as Dracula s castle Bran Castle welcomes tourists unlike the Villa Diodati on the waterfront of Lake Geneva in Cologny Switzerland This was the site where in the Romantic poets Lord Byron and Percy Shelley and their entourage tried to scare themselves silly by telling ghost stories during a particularly violent thunderstorm The meeting was to prompt the teenage Mary Shelley to write Frankenstein and Byron s much put upon doctor John William Polidori to pen The Vampyre Villa Diodati is privately owned and security fences keep the curious out It is not only family manors or rambling country mansions that inspire Gothic vibes For a time Detroit s abandoned factories stood in as symbols of a whole industrial economic and social order coming to an end No wonder this landscape features in recent horror films such as It Follows Don t Breathe or Barbarian We also seem to be spooked by the husks of prisons or asylums those sprawling institutions whose ruins haunt us with the death of a certain optimistic belief that a spell of institutional treatment might improve people The last of these so called monster asylums such as the Willard Asylum for the Chronic Insane in Ovid New York shut down in the These are the most haunted places in the U S Sigmund Freud the founder of psychoanalysis sometimes turned to the house as a metaphor for the human psyche a place with lots of secrets locked away in basements or forgotten bedrooms An avid reader of Gothic stories Freud argued that the Gothic inspired feelings of the unheimlich Often translated as uncanny the original German means unhomely and this gets at precisely what unnerves us about haunted house tales the irruption of something horrifying or unholy in precisely the location we always thought was the safest space The Gothic runs and re runs this anxiety on an endless loop trying to shore up our sense of home knowing all the while that the unhomely always lurks in the shadows of dusty rooms the creak of staircases or along the vistas of empty corridors Roger Luckhurst published Gothic An Illustrated History in and has written cultural histories of psychical research zombies vampires and mummies Related Topics HOUSES MODERN HISTORY LIVING
