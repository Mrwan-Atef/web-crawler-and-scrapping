Jul min read Share Old Town Prague is a good example of external influences mixing with local traditions Â Jason Najum Lonely Planet I went to Prague in June before heading on a short road trip around the Czech Republic It was the most expensive part of our stay but we could afford to splurge as it was a whirlwind visit Forty eight hours was just enough time to see the main sights and get a taste of the nightlife before recovering for a few days in the quiet town of Cesky Krumlov three hours south of Prague and Kutna Hora hour mins east of Prague I booked flights and accommodation well in advance leaving me with extra Koruna for Czech beer Old Town Prague is a good example of external influences mixing with local traditions Â Jason Najum Lonely Planet Pre trip spending Flights Â return from London Luton to Prague VÃ clav Havel with Wizz Air I booked these flights a few months in advance to get the best possible price Advertisement Accommodation Â which was split between my friend and I for two nights We got lucky and found a huge room in a shared Airbnb about minutes walk from Charles Bridge in Praha district When on short trips I prefer to book a private room in an Airbnb rather than an entire property Itâ s a fraction of the price and if youâ re like me youâ ll spend most of your time out and about anyway We also saved on transport costs there were cheaper Airbnbâ s further out of town but then weâ d have to use public transport Car hire Â per day We hired a car at the end of our time in Prague to drive down south to Cesky Krumlov Public transport options are available but we opted for the freedom a rental car gives you Total Â On the ground Friday Total Â We landed delayed and stressed at Prague Airport to a barrage of messages from our Airbnb host saying weâ d missed the check in time Not ideal We booked an Uber Â each while going through passport control and were on our way in no time Public transport would be my usual normally cheaper option but we didn t have time to spare The late night last minute snacks including the Â nuts Â Joe Davis Lonely Planet Midnight Luckily we were not homeless for the night and arranged for the room key to be left in a newsagents below the Airbnb We picked up some snacks along with the key to tide us over until the morning The last thing I ate was an overpriced sandwich at Luton Airport so I hurriedly grabbed a selection of crisps nuts chocolate and two beers without checking the prices these were actually the cheapest items at Â each to have in our room I mindlessly tapped my Monzo card to pay and it wasnâ t until I opened up my app later than I realised Iâ d been charged Â I thought it must be a mistake and ran back downstairs to a bemused shopkeeper who explained that nuts and Pringles really do cost the equivalent Â each The worst part We didnâ t even like them Iâ m glad I learned this lesson early on Every cloud Saturday Total Â After a well deserved lie in we scouted out a nearby breakfast place for coffee Ignoring the tourist traps on the bank of the Vltava river we chose a small cafe on a side street called SmetanaQ It had a substantial breakfast menu and a quiet terrace to enjoy the morning sun I got a flat white Â with avocado and poached eggs on sourdough bread Â The first breakfast in Prague Â Joe Davis Lonely Planet Advertisement The next few hours were spent walking off our breakfast and dodging the crowds on Charles Bridge I was a bit disappointed with how busy the bridge was I just wanted to cross it and escape the crowds We got the funicular up to Petrin Hill Â for a single Disclaimer this price could be totally wrong I panicked at the machine and pressed the first button I saw I was reluctant to queue as you could walk to the top but my friend persuaded me that it would be fun â and it was The cityâ s incredible architecture slowly came into view as the funicular climbed higher At the top we were treated to a spectacular rose garden and shady wooded walks towards Prague Castle The secret rose garden on the way towards Prague Castle Â Joe Davis Lonely Planet Weâ d been in Prague far too long to not have tried the local beer yet so we made a pit stop at a small bar dubbed an â alchemical lab pubâ called KellyxÃ r It was tucked away in a quiet courtyard and served smoking cocktails It felt a little early for a chemistry experiment and we settled for the local beer Â for a large When beer is this cheap it would be rude not to right When in Prague Â Joe Davis Lonely Planet Amidst the excitement of funiculars and beer we forgot to have lunch and opted to have an early dinner instead We found a gorgeous spot overlooking ostrov one of the small islands on the Vltava River and ate on the roof terrace of Art CafÃ Manes The excellent food was cooked on large grills near the tables I had a vegetarian burger Â a White Russian Â and a small beer Â for dessert Burgers and White Russians for lunch Â Joe Davis Lonely Planet Time to burn off the burger with a self powered river cruise on a pedalo Â each for an hour The scale of the river makes it feel more like a lake â itâ s a popular spot to relax by or on the water Floating bars add to the relaxed fun atmosphere This was one of the highlights of my time in Prague â itâ s such a good way to see the city from a new perspective and get up close to The Charles bridge without the crowds Pedalos offer a different perspective on Prague Â Joe Davis Lonely Planet Afterwards we made the short hop across the bridge to Prague Beer Museum We hit luck with an outside table and stayed for hours watching the crowds go by until well after the sun had set Although quite touristy it has beers on tap and is an excellent place to sample Czech beer from different regions I ordered the â Hop Loversâ tasting flight Â a â Mix Number Oneâ Â and a â Flying Cloud IPAâ Â Full disclosure â the rest of the night is a bit hazy In the next bar whose name escapes me see above we made friends with two generous tourists from Ireland who handed us a Jager Bomb each Â This was probably the last thing I needed but by this point I was in full on party mode on our one night out A Saturday well spent in Prague Â Joe Davis Lonely Planet We made more friends â this time locals â who took us under their wing and introduced us to their favourite basement bar Rock CafÃ We used a free app called â Bar Boxâ to be DJs for the night on the jukebox The details are unclear at best but we went in with Â worth of Czech Koruna and left with nothing Iâ m reliably informed that we bought shots for each member of staff behind the bar who were very friendly as well as many beers for ourselves I guess in that case itâ s safe to assume I spent Â which doesnâ t seem too bad considering Sunday Total Â KFC isnâ t my usual go to cuisine when Iâ m on holiday especially as a pescatarian but on a late night hunt for food I settled for some chips and onion rings Â Some soakage was definitely a sensible idea and something I was grateful for the next morning The last memory of Saturday night Â Joe Davis Lonely Planet Midday Feeling fragile we checked out of our Airbnb and walked a few meters to the nearest cafe for coffee and a croissant Â Road trip time We had a few hours to kill until we picked up our hire car and headed to Cesky Krumlov We got an Uber Â each to Prague Train Station as the temperature was a little high for a hungover walk Lunch today was an unglamorous panini Â which was consumed on the marble steps of Prague Train Station while nursing a hangover The final tally Overall spend Â flights Â accommodation Â car hire Â Â Notes This was a quick visit to Prague before we embarked on a longer road trip around the country For a less expensive quieter alternative to Prague Iâ d recommend Kutna Hora Itâ s about an hour by train from Prague and has some exceptional architecture including the Sedlec Ossuary Bone Church and Cathedral of St Barbara More spending diaries What I
