read Share Food is served on the floor in the middle of the majlis at the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding in Al Fahidi district Dubai UAE While Dubai has plenty of intriguing cuisines on offer from Pakistani and Peruvian to Ethiopian and Iranian it s always been a little trickier to find authentic Emirati fare in the city Traditionally these dishes have just been served in homes or at major celebrations but that s finally starting to change as a decent selection of Emirati restaurants crop up across town Advertisement Emirati food is served in the majlis at the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding Â Glen Pearson Lonely Planet So what exactly is Emirati cuisine Expect hearty meat dishes born in the desert and seafood from the Arabian Peninsula usually served with flatbread and rice Bezar a blend of roasted and ground spices including coriander cumin turmeric and cinnamon is added to practically everything while centuries old trading partners such as Iran and India have also left their mark on the cuisine Many of the newer restaurants aren t just sticking to a traditional menu though camel sliders and chicken tikka stuffed breads are just a couple of the unexpected Emirati fusion treats on offer Hereâ s where to get your fill in Dubai Contemporary cooking at Aseelah With dishes like date stuffed chicken roulade and juicy camel sliders Aseelah at Radisson Blu Hotel Dubai Deira Creek serves up the cityâ s most adventurous and accomplished take on local cuisine Old school favourites are not forgotten German born chef Uwe Micheel has spent years visiting Emirati families to master recipes like prawns marinated in bezar and aseeda bobar pumpkin pudding This stylish spot is the only Emirati restaurant that serves booze with creative cocktails and a well priced wine list A trio of camel sliders with different toppings including date and lime jam Â NikAndTam Authentic flavours at Al Fanar Al Fanar is a kitsch fun spot with food and decor harking back to the pre oil days Donâ t let the Festival City Mall location put you off designed like an old courtyard house the restaurant is hugely atmospheric just ignore the dodgy waxworks First timers are encouraged to try chicken machboos a bezar spiced rice dish and tender naghar mashwi grilled squid Thereâ s a second branch at Town Centre Jumeriah Advertisement A platter of lamb saloona and chicken mandi at Al Tawasol Â Glen Pearson Lonely Planet Home style cooking at Al Tawasol Locals have been flocking to the family run Al Tawasol in Deira for food like grandma used to make since Take a seat on a corner of carpet in the main dining area or in one of the private tented majlis reception rooms and then scoop up succulent lamb machboos and spicy saloona curry with your hands Al Tawasol also does a mean mandi a Yemeni dish thatâ s been adopted across the Arabian Peninsula meat slow cooked in a tandoor and served over aromatic rice Camel milk treats at Majlis With intricate mashrabiya wooden lattice screens and a blue tiled fountain Majlis at Dubai Mall specialises in coffee cakes shakes and ice cream made from camel milk A staple of the Bedouin diet until the mid century itâ s lower in fat and higher in vitamins and minerals than the cow equivalent Try a camelccino made with the cafeâ s own blend of Ethiopian beans paired with a pistachio glazed Ã clair made with â you guessed it â camel milk Prawn fouga bezar spices cooked together with perfumed stock at Seven Sands Â Glen Pearson Lonely Planet Trendy meets traditional at Seven Sands Spread over two floors at The Beach at JBR Seven Sands features sleek Middle Eastern interiors and a breezy terrace overlooking the sea Blending traditional with trendy the menu is full of Emirati classics but youâ ll also see dishes from the wider region such as velvety hummus and crumbly kibbeh meat filled cracked wheat croquettes Dishes to try Sambousas â similar to Indian samosas but given a bezar spice twist â and prawn fouga flavoured with bezar saffron and dry limes Creative khameer at Logma Located in trendy BoxPark Logma is a hip eatery with modern interiors â think funky camel motifs and hanging kerosene lamps â and casual contemporary Emirati fare Itâ s a top spot for lunch with soft khameer flatbread stuffed with fillings such as chicken tikka or smothered in more traditional cream cheese and dibs date syrup Order with a side of Logmaâ s famous fries seasoned with Middle Eastern spices Visitors sit down for a meal at the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding Â Glen Pearson Lonely Planet Cultural meals at Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding For a crash course in both Emirati cuisine and culture visit the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding in a renovated wind tower house in the historic Al Fahidi district Dishes such as chicken machboos and lip smackingly sweet luqaimat doughnuts drizzled in dibs are served while sitting cross legged on carpets and cushions on the floor Hosted by young Emirati volunteers visitors are encouraged to ask questions about local culture with no topic off limits Casual bites at Milas Popular with Emiratis Milas is a buzzing spot at Dubai Mall that combines glossy black and warm wood interiors with accessible Emirati cuisine Munch on cumin sprinkled dangaw boiled chickpeas and still steaming khameer flatbread while you peruse the large menu presented on an iPad Start with endless cups of Arabic coffee brewed with cardamom and served with sticky dates followed by the signature mbahar deyay chicken in a spicy cream sauce with saffron infused rice First published in October https shop lonelyplanet com products dubai abu dhabi city guide Advertisement Advertisement
