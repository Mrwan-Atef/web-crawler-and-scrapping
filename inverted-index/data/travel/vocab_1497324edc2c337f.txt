How to spend a weekend in Forest of Dean England TRAVEL Why the ancient Forest of Dean should be your next UK destination Woodland pursuits riverside walks and local produce await in this overlooked nook on the southern Welsh border An ode to the Great British outdoors the tree fringed towns honey cottages and biking trails of the Forest of Dean make for a charming break Photograph by Getty Images By Georgia Stephens August This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Time travel impossible Hardly In the Forest of Dean the mighty moss cloaked oaks and deep fern lined gullies are much as the Tudor kings left them when they last galloped through Beneath the thick canopy of this ancient woodland which straddles the languid River Wye and the Welsh border in southwest Gloucestershire wild boars still churn the earth with their tusks while woodpeckers and nuthatches flit in the branches above the air scented with the resinous tang of pine needles Lovers of the outdoors will be in their element here with mountain biking canoeing hiking and everything in between up for grabs And for those keen for more leisurely pursuits there are charming tree fringed towns to explore all honeyed cottages country pubs and roaming sheep where chefs are making the most of the forest s rich pantry Vibrant contemporary artwork pieces can be found along the Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail stretching for almost five miles Photograph by Forestry England How should I explore the forest The best way to explore it is to dive right in Hit the trails on an e bike from Wye Bikes in Coleford south west of Gloucester and in a single morning you can pedal just under miles to the shoreline of Mallards Pike where the mirror smooth waters reflect the fluffy tips of the conifers Alternatively Puzzlewood six miles west is a real life swathe of enchanted forest or so it s easy to believe The Forest of Dean is said to have inspired Tolkien s Middle Earth and this woodland labyrinth of scowles mossy hollows left over from the forest s once thriving mining industry traversed via woven bridges feels suitably otherworldly If that heritage intrigues you explore it further on a guided tour of the nine large caverns at nearby Clearwell Caves Anyone born locally is allowed to mine for the ochre used for artists pigment which is found here Artists have long been inspired by the leafy landscape here and you can take in some of their works on the Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail miles of contemporary pieces strung between the trees north of Mallards Pike Don t miss Kevin Atherton s Cathedral a high stained glass window that depicts the forest in shades of green umber and blue Where s the best place to stay In Clearwell it s easy to miss the Tudor Farmhouse Hotel at first its sprawl of attractive cottages blends seamlessly into the quiet village that surrounds it Then you spot the wooden sign depicting a white chicken Chickens it turns out are everywhere They re in the hotel s artworks they re roaming the hilly grounds The guest rooms replete with exposed stone wood beams and the odd roll top bath range in pecking order from hatchling to cockerel Tucked away in the village of Clearwell the Tudor Farmhouse Hotel is comprised of a number of attractive honey hued cottages Photograph by Tudor Farmhouse Hotel It can be difficult to tear yourself away but an outing with resident naturalist Ed Drewitt is worth it whether it s foraging for the likes of hairy bittercress or waking up at the crack of dawn to catch a glimpse of those wild boars As
