for the first time Rebecca Milner Charles Usher Jun min read Share South Korea s bathhouses draw in people of all ages with hot and cold baths saunas and more Â Shutterstock Traditional bathhouses are an essential part of contemporary South Korean culture and one of the country s top experiences Literally heated rooms j jimjilbang ì ì ë are where locals come to unwind hang out and engage in a whole host of health and beauty rituals that go far beyond a quick soak South Korea s bathhouses attract grandmas and young couples alike It wouldn t be odd for a group of friends to meet up at a jjimjilbang on a Friday night â call it a spa date but a surprisingly affordable one Entry to a bathhouse usually costs between â and â with smaller neighborhood jjimjilbang being the cheapest option Most places have different day and evening entry fees with the latter being a little higher More elaborate joints have restaurants outdoor swimming pools hair and nail salons and karaoke rooms in addition to the usual baths and saunas These spas have an unspoken code of manners and customs which can make a first time visit intimidating for foreign travelers Here s our guide to towel techniques and Korean bathhouse etiquette to help you experience the jjimjilbang like a local Arriving at a jjimjilbang in South Korea The first thing you re likely to see when you walk in the door is a wall of small lockers These are for your shoes so slip them inside and take your locker key back to the front desk Pay the entry fee the price should be posted at the reception desk and hand over your shoe locker key In exchange you ll be given a new locker key for the changing room sometimes the first key is used for both plus a towel and a pair of cotton pajamas Many jjimjilbang use electronic keys or wristbands which are also used to record the fees for any additional services Otherwise the staff will note your locker key number if you add any services inside such as a scrub or massage and bill you at the end It s increasingly common for jjimjilbang to have automated check in kiosks where you can pay the entry fee and get a key or wristband without going to the front desk The key in your hand should have a number on it â that s your locker where you ll store your clothes and anything else you re carrying The front desk staff should point you in the direction of the appropriate gender segregated changing room If not you want nam ë for men or yeo ì for women What are the baths at jjimjilbang like Most jjimjilbang have two distinct areas the baths which are same sex only and the sauna areas which are communal Whichever you visit first is up to you but most people prefer to wash up before sweating it out and then wash again at the end of the visit The best way to stay connected Saily provides a hassle free solution to travel data â just choose your data plan and prepare for your trip When you get to your destination you can go online right away Get your eSIM If you re going to the baths you need to remove all your clothing bringing only a small towel and toiletries with you wear your locker key on your wrist If you re going to the sauna change into the pajamas provided The cardinal rule here is that you need to wash before getting into the baths There will be rows of washing stations and piles of plastic stools grab one and pick a faucet There will be soap but rarely shampoo or conditioner so you ll need to bring your own most convenience stores in South Korea sell single use packets of various toiletries and jjimjilbang usually sell them as well You don t have to wash your hair but if you don t and it s long be sure to tie it up so it doesn t trail in the bath Once you re nice and clean you can head to the tubs Bathhouse tubs come in a variety of temperatures from about Â C F not too hot to about C F pretty hot and there are also cold tubs at around C F Koreans often alternate between the various temperatures In most jjimjilbang the soaking pools are indoors but some places also have open air baths Bathhouse regulars have their individual routines down to a science but in general the optimal soaking time is considered to be minutes If you plan to stay in the water this long it s best to keep your heart above the waterline Some upmarket em jjimjilbang em in South Korea have outdoor pools that resemble natural springs Â mnimage Shutterstock South Koreans and South Korean women in particular are mad about exfoliation and you ll see locals giving themselves long and hearty scrubs You can buy scrubbing towels and mitts at convenience stores and markets If you really want to up your jjimjilbang game you can opt for a professional scrub called seshin In a corner of the bathroom there will be a few plastic tables manned by ajumma aunties â or men on the men s side â wielding scrubbing mitts They re generally merciless but you will never have smoother skin in your life Do this after soaking for a bit so the steam from the baths can loosen up your skin A basic scrub usually costs â and you can also get an oil massage for about â Getting used to being in the buff at a South Korean bathhouse The most difficult part of the experience for a lot of first timers is being naked in front of strangers Fear not locals consider nudity a normal part of visiting a jjimjilbang and you are unlikely to be given a second glance by anyone else You can always use your towel to strategically cover yourself as you walk around but the towels are small so this isn t easy You shouldn t bring your towel into the water If your towel does get wet a stack of fresh towels is usually waiting near the door to the changing room The best way to keep your towel dry is to wear it on your head Another etiquette tip splashing and loud talking may earn you some dirty looks What are South Korean saunas like The sauna you might picture â a steaming room heated to hellish temperatures â is probably different from a Korean sauna Traditional saunas in South Korea called hanjeungmak í ì ë are stone or clay kilns that are typically heated to between C F and C F and are really quite pleasant If you ve never liked saunas elsewhere you might like them here As you lie on hemp mats or sometimes salt or jade crystals the heated stone gently warms your body and after about to minutes you ll start to sweat It s easy to fall asleep but don t â or you ll risk dehydration Keep your sauna time limited to around minutes if this is your first time and remember to stay hydrated Cap off a good steam with a cold sweet cup of sikhye â a traditional fermented rice drink usually sold at jjimjilbang You can also buy eggs that have been steamed in the saunas known as maekbanseok year Why do jjimjilbang have sleeping rooms Many jjimjilbang are open hours and double as South Korea s best budget accommodations For a few thousand won more than the standard entrance fee you can opt to spend the night in the sleeping room In simpler spots this might just be a wide room with some thin plastic mattresses and yes they are thin and squishy plastic blocks serving as pillows on the floor In more sophisticated places the sleeping rooms resemble capsule hotels with two levels of cubbyholes that offer a little privacy Some have separate rooms for women and snorers regardless earplugs are a good idea Some also have blankets to loan or rent though the rooms are usually heated â using the traditional under floor ondol technique â so they re usually not necessary There are usually big common rooms where people congregate to watch TV sit in massage chairs eat snacks and generally hang out These areas are mixed and non naked so be sure to wear the pajamas provided Some of the fancier jjimjilbang also have outdoor swimming areas hot tubs and entertainment zones such as arcades to keep sauna goers busy sometimes throughout the night Checking out at the end of a session This part s easy Hand your locker key to the front desk staff and they ll present you with a bill if you ve racked up any charges inside Once you re paid up you get your shoe locker key back so grab your shoes and you re good to go Most jjimjilbang expect you to stay no more than one night though some may allow you to negotiate a stay of multiple nights There s every chance you ll find yourself wanting to come back Combine a
