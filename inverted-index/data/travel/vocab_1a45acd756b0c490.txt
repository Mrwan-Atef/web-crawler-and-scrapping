France last week and there are no words to describe the experience we had Everyone absolutely all the hotel staff go to great lengths to make you feel like the most special person in the world Cordiality kindness and efficiency that we had never seen anywhere When you arrive the staff promptly open the car doors and unload your luggage taking it to your room without you noticing At the check in counter a glass of sparkling wine is offered as a welcome while the room is tidied up Then one of the staff gives us a tour of the hotel and takes us to our room When you open the door everything is impeccable classical music playing on the TV a bucket with mini sparkling wines the same ones sampled at reception and welcome snacks and sweets Room finally decorated everything extremely clean and fragrant Free water coffee and tea are always available and available to guests Spectacular breakfast served entirely at the table with a multitude of a la carte dish options all framed by live music At dinner incredible and very well prepared options the price of which is lower than most restaurants in the city Intimate atmosphere super attentive staff and live music
