great Be prepared for a long day worth it and bring sunscreen Shout out to Enrique Rey and Luis for being awesome Read more Written April contributions of bubbles A must do when visiting Cancun We had a great trip to Chichen Itza today the bus arrived on time and collected us from the hotel lobby Our tour guide Ceasar and driver were brilliant throughout the day The drive from Cancun took approximately mins drive The first stop not mentioned in the itinerary was at a local cooperative shop nearby to Chichen Itza where it appeared lots of tours also stopped Here there was information provided about the homemade nature of the items sold A bit of history was provided about the different materials used and it was encouraged to spend money here rather than at the stalls within Chichen Itza Our second stop was Chichen Itza where we paid for entry approx USD pp mentioned prior to the trip also wow what can I say it was spectacular Ceasar and his colleague explained about the Mayan culture and history of Chichen Itza showcasing the different parts of the site with such enthusiasm it was amazing It gets very hot here so it is recommended to take an umbrella from your hotel in the morning or you can hire them at Chichen Itza itself but at the very least a sun hat The tour was about hr and then we had free time for about then returned to the bus Our third trip was the Cenote This was about mins drive from Chichen Itza and very beautiful Our entry was included in the trip but you had to hire lift jackets and lockers for approximately pesos per couple two life jackets and one locker to share We had two hours here also it was recommended to swim first and then eat the Cenote was so beautiful we loved it The food provided in a buffet style was also really good Drinks were extra but we had been made aware of that prior to the trip and we would recommend the piña coladas the staff were very friendly Finally our last trip was to Valladolid this was a short stop of approximately to see the Colonial town particular interest here was the architecture the icecream shop and the churros sold in the park would recommend After a long day out and early start there wasn t much energy left to expend The return trip was approximately The bus was comfortable and airconditioned and very clean with the driver taking care and providing a smooth trip with punctual time keeping throughout We thoroughly enjoyed our day out and would definitely recommend this trip For the price I think it was very good value Read more Written April contributions of bubbles Very
