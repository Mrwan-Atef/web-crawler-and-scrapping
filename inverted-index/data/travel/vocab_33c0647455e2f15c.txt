coast of Alaska s Katmai National Park It mirrors mom s adult behavior but is still playful affectionate Now the cub snuggles against her and they sit down facing away from us and curl up for a nap They re completely almost radically at peace with our presence And the feeling is mutual Within half an hour my fianc√© who like many first time visitors to Katmai had been concerned about coming close to such large predators is so at ease around the bears that he too falls asleep in the grass Around brown bears live in Katmai National Park and Preserve s four million acres and its Pacific coast separated from the rest of the park by the Aleutian Range is home to some of the highest densities of brown bears ever recorded Abundant coastal food sources like sedges salmon and razor clams

Everything to know about Katmai National Park D ave Bachrach has led brown bear trips in Katmai for over years Now he is steady and relaxed and speaks with calm authority dressed in the same muddy gray as the glacial silt that forms this coast Following his example allows tourists to fit for a few hours into the bears world I want people to see bears in their natural environment he says not reacting to us A tour group watches a mother bear nurse her cub in Hallo Bay where meadows of protein rich sedge grass provide ample food before the summer s salmon runs begin Brown bears have been part of my life for as long as I can remember In their my parents spent their summers running one of Alaska s first brown bear viewing camps on the rugged coast just north of the Katmai border Brown bears were revered in our household and we regarded them as individuals with as research now shows their own personalities Living with bears demands respect my mother told me We were honored to be visitors in their world Bear photos are still tacked up among family pictures in my parents kitchen Biggest Bear Ever Found It Blew My Mind Expert Says Their five years as bear guides in the mid took place during a pivotal shift in thought in Alaska where brown bear tourism had previously been synonymous with trophy hunting Biologists and field staff at the nearby McNeil River State Game Sanctuary were learning to read brown bear behavior challenging longtime assumptions that bears were unpredictable Bears really do chase skiers but is this video fake They discovered that if humans behaved equally predictably by limiting visitors to small guided groups respecting the bears behavior and space and never exposing the animals to human food the bears could grow tolerant of a human presence over time I grew up regularly visiting McNeil River and assumed that gazing out at a landscape of bears at a time was normal Brown bears were revered in our household and we regarded them as individuals with as research now shows their own personalities Nearly years ago McNeil River s most influential manager Larry Aumiller started a successful program bringing visitors to watch brown bears from the same spot every day of every summer The program continues today Field staff give each bear a name as an identifier like Braveheart or Solstice or Ears and add each day s observations to decades of compiled research Alaska is the best place to see wild bears A new mine could change that At McNeil I learned to notice how bears honed unique fishing tactics snatching airborne fish from waterfalls snorkeling after fish in eddies or waiting downstream for larger bears scraps Mother bears can be hovering and attentive parents that discipline their cubs or they can be comparatively lax letting them run wild The memories that stand out most involved the bears incredible displays of vulnerability and trust a female called T Bear that chose to nurse her cubs in front of my camera lens a blond bear with a radial halo of a face that approached my father and me so she could take a nap beside us in the shade What I didn t realize as a child was that these moments could take place only because of how the land was protected and managed From the air the green sedge of the Katmai coast appears etched with brown bear trails illuminating a web of passages that have been followed for generations To Aumiller spending time with bears in the wild is in its broadest sense about learning to share space with wild animals In Katmai this act of sharing land with bears is not new Traces of human habitation dating back years have been found along salmon laden rivers where bears still fish today It s always seemed to me that people who don t learn to share don t thrive Aumiller once told me And those who share do If you can learn to do that with an apex predator I think you can do that with almost anything One of the biggest threats to brown bears is irreversible habitat loss Globally brown bears occupy only percent of their former range Nearly all the brown bears left in the United States live here in Alaska Katmai s expansive unbroken terrain is precious A single bear in Katmai may roam more than miles each summer to find enough food to survive the winter The urgent need for conservation of this land can feel abstract until you see a mother bear and her cub in person Retracing the explosive history of a remote national park in Alaska B rown bears are Ursus arctos the same species as grizzlies Standing seven to nine feet tall and weighing up to pounds they grow

Floatplanes line the beach arriving guests are briefed with a safety video in a small theater and two gift shops and a restaurant do a brisk trade The last time I visited the falls crowded viewing platform I was given a minute wait time and a restaurant pager with a picture of a bear on it It s a great place to reliably see bears but it s an entirely different experience from being out in the coastal wilds in a small group surrounded by bears in every direction Shaped by volcanic and glacial activity Cape Douglas is part of Katmai s miles of rugged coastline along the Shelikof Strait all of it home to brown bears The Katmai coast is accessible only by air or sea and its remoteness coupled with its plentiful natural food sources helps make bear viewing here as safe as it is Far from roads or settlements Katmai s brown bears have never learned to associate humans with food or harm In areas like Hallo Bay tourists have been coming to watch bears for decades following the same protocols developed by Aumiller and other bear biologists Each time we spot a bear Bachrach reads its behavior If the bear appears relaxed we can watch for a while to see what it does If it shows any signs of anxiety moving away from us yawning or in extreme cases huffing we give it space and leave it alone We must never provoke behavior let bears get too close and most important never let even a crumb of our food fall to the ground The bear guides who took over from my parents learned this the hard way when a door once blew open to a cabin where a bowl of fruit had been left out on a counter

in the grass while seven or eight more bears graze in the far distance On the other side below a gravel beach an amber bear wanders the glacial mudflats It s searching for razor clams which it will either crush or pry open with its jaws and dexterous claws The image of a bear as a ferocious carnivore shows only one facet of an intelligent and highly complex animal In the wild brown bears rarely fight They spend their days searching for food resting playing traveling and caring for their young And they re omnivores much like humans A study found that bears are less carnivorous than previously thought When bears emerge from their dens in the spring in Katmai they feast on sedges and dig for razor clams at low tide As the salmon run from late June through September the bears move to the mouths of salmon filled rivers but they ll also continue eating grass and berries By the time they return to hibernation they can have increased their body weight by percent Why wild salmon remains king in the Pacific Northwest Cubs tussle playfully in a meadow in Hallo Bay Adult brown bears rarely fight if they can help it preferring to manage most conflicts by displays of body language To be in tune with what bears are doing is to be in tune with what foods are in season and by extension what s happening in their environment A healthy bear is a sign of a healthy ecosystem A t the end of August I join Bachrach and six guests on a liveaboard boat for a weeklong trip down the Katmai coast It s salmon season the beginning of summer s turn toward fall When we return to Hallo Bay the grass has yellowed and the bears have largely dispersed but we spot a female with a rare group of four tiny first year cubs Farther south we watch bears fish in small remote coves where thousands of salmon hang suspended in ribbons of green water Each time a new brown bear arrives at the edge of a river the bears shift positions to allow space according to a hierarchy of size We too move carefully around the bears and around other tour groups visiting by boat and floatplane This time is vital to the bears winter survival Ensuring that we don t disturb their feeding is one of the most important parts of being a responsible visitor Finally we sail toward Geographic Harbor named in honor of National Geographic in by an explorer whose expedition was funded by the Society It s a maze of islands where waterfalls rush from basaltic cliffs and alders blanket the land down to the waterline When the weather clears we re driven ashore in Zodiacs to a tidal plain where a river fans out to the sea Life here moves to the rhythm of Katmai s foot tides and as the water rises the rivers begin to jostle with salmon Brown bears gather each fall along the tidal flats and creeks near Geographic Harbor to fish for salmon creating a perfect spectacle for visitors A dark chocolate colored bear with two cubs appears out of the alders then a lanky adolescent then a big male with a shaggy copper coat Gulls cry out overhead Soon the bears are everywhere fat and glossy lunging into the rivers to catch the most calorie rich food of the year Five species of salmon migrate through Katmai s rivers each one at a different time and the bears know exactly when the time is right In a few hours the whole landscape will be underwater Soon the bears will retreat to their dens to sleep through the winter New mothers will bear their young in the dark What do you think people get out of seeing bears I ask Bachrach During our days together aboard the boat I ve watched his guests go from hesitant to awestruck then comfortable and then observant and thoughtful Hopefully they re experiencing something that is both inspirational and humbling that creates a reconnection to something wild that lives within them Bachrach says But they re also getting a wilderness experience that will help them better understand the value of having wildlife and wilderness in our lives of the coolest travel
