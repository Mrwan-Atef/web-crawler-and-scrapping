several names across Italy from Romeâ s suppli to Sicilyâ s arancini SupplÃ are made with arborio rice and filled with melted mozzarella hence its full name â supplÃ al telefono â because the cheese

northern provinces of Parma Reggio Emilia Modena Bologna and Mantua â it s made using milk from free range cows on a prized grass or hay diet Gorgonzola Gloriously pungent this washed rind blue veined

Adriatico Mar in Venice Mastro Ciccio in Puglia Borgiattino in Turin Decide who makes the best gelato in Italy The best Italian gelato uses seasonal ingredients and no synthetic colors letting the materials set the stage for the look and flavor of the scoop Itâ s a perennial battle where to get the best gelato in Italyâ one worth investigating on your own Where to try it Giolitti and Fiordiluna in Rome Vivoli and Gelateria Pasticceria Badiani in Florence Espresso machine in Rome Kathrin Ziegler Getty Images World class coffee comes in various forms Most Italian mornings start with a creamy frothy cappuccino named for the Capuchin monks with their brown hoods which is rarely taken after about and usually served not too hot Otherwise it s espresso all the way though you could ask for a tiny stain of milk in a caffÃ macchiato or a cheeky caffÃ corretto espresso that s corrected with a splash of grappa or brandy On the hottest summer days a granita di caffÃ coffee with shaved ice and whipped cream is ideal An ever growing number of Italian bars in both northern and southern Italy now also offer alternatives to cow s milk making that cappuccino con latte di soia soy milk cappuccino or latte di mandorla almond milk less unusual than it once was Where to try it Al Parlamento in Venice CafÃ del Binari in Milan CaffÃ Sant Eustachio in Rome â and every other hamlet and city in Italy It s not an Italian meal without wine Choosing wine is as important a consideration as your choice of dinner date Indeed while the country s perfectly quaffable pilsner beers and occasional red ale pair well with roast meats pizza and other quick eats vino is considered appropriate for a proper meal â and since many wines cost less than a pint in Italy this is not a question of price but a matter of flavor Some Italian wines will be as familiar to you as old flames including pizza and a movie Chianti or reliable summertime fling pinot grigio But you ll also find some captivating Italian varietals and blends for which there is no translation Brunello Vermentino SciacchetrÃ and intriguing Italian wines that have little in common with European and New World cousins of the same name from merlot and pinot nero aka pinot noir to chardonnay Many visitors default to carafes of house reds or whites which in Italy usually means young fruit forward reds to complement tomato sauces and chilled dry whites as seafood palate cleansers But with a little daring you can pursue a broader range of options by the glass or half bottle Where to try it Everywhere Sicilian alla norma is a popular vegetarian dish made with basil eggplant ricotta and tomato Paolo Paradiso Getty Images Keeping vegetarians and vegans happy and fed in Italy Starter primi menus usually include ostensibly vegetarian options such as pasta con pesto â the classic Ligurian basil paste with Parmigiano Reggiano Parmesan and pine nuts â or Sicilian alla norma with basil eggplant ricotta and tomato risotto ai porcini risotto with pungent earthy porcini mushrooms or the extravagant risotto al Barolo risotto with high end Barolo wine though any good dry red will do But even if a dish sounds vegetarian in theory check before you order about the stock used in that risotto or polenta or the ingredients in that suspiciously rich tomato sauce there may be beef ham or ground anchovies involved And vegans will do battle with the prevalence of cheese in dishes â always check to ensure it doesn t come with a sprinkling of something even if the menu doesn t mention it Delicious dishes you can t miss Missoltini Como s sun dried fish cured in salt and bay leaves Lampredotto Cowâ s stomach boiled sliced seasoned and bunged between bread in Florence Pani ca meusa A Palermo sandwich of beef spleen and lungs dipped in boiling lard Zurrette Sardinian black pudding made of sheep s blood cooked in a sheep s stomach with herbs and fennel Trippa alla romana Head to Romeâ s Testaccio neighborhood for nose
