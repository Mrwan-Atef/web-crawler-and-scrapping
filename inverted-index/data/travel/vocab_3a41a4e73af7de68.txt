min read Share Head to Aling Aling Waterfall in Northern Bali or explore Phang Nga bay by boat iStock Anyone planning an island escape in Southeast Asia faces a tricky decision â in a region studded with sand circled tropical islands that sizzle with fabulous food and overflow with culture how do you pick just one This magical part of the world has enough island escapes to fill several lifetimes of travel but regrettably we only have one so the shortlist has to be narrowed down For a first taste of Southeast Asia s islands we d make a strong pitch for Phuket in Thailand and Bali in Indonesia â both are rich in culture wrapped in sparkling sands and accessible to everyone from students in flipflops to empty nesters catching up on far flung travel But which to choose Luckily we have a pair of seasoned travel writers on hand to make the case for each of these beloved island hubs Read on to see if Phuket or Bali is the right escape for you Advertisement From downtown markets to the karst landscapes of Ao Phang Nga National Park Phuket is a sampling platter of Thai experiences Sergii Figurnyi Shutterstock Favor fabulous Phuket Isabella Noble is a Barcelona based travel journalist and the author of Lonely Planetâ s Pocket Phuket guide She has been spending time on this beautiful sometimes underappreciated Thai island for almost a decade For anyone who loves Phuket â as I do â itâ s a magical island that instantly defies the stereotypes without making any fuss Thailand bursts with dreamy laid back palm filled islands washed by gentle turquoise waves but Phuket pronounced poo ket combines this tropical paradise allure with the lively buzz creative vibe and thrilling food scene of a dynamic urban hub Letâ s start with those fabulous flour soft salt white beaches My favorites are in the north of the island including sparkling Hat Surin endless Hat Bang Thao and wilder Hat Layan Phuketâ s three northwesternmost strands are a treat too Hat Nai Yang Hat Mai Khao and Hat Nai Thon all sit within the protected Sirinat National Park and have a blissfully relaxed nature first feel On the islandâ s southern tip mellow Hat Rawai is another beachy beauty that I seek out on every visit Itâ s known for its rustic seafood restaurants buzzing kitesurfing scene and the powdery strands close by at Hat Nai Han Blazing sunsets draw crowds to dramatic Laem Phromthep Promthep Cape and thereâ s an almost mystical feel as everyone simultaneously gazes out as the sun drops into the jade colored Andaman Sea The dining scene in Phuket is a rich buffet of Thai flavors Vladimir Razguliaev Getty Images Phuketâ s vibrant food scene Phuket also has one of Thailandâ s most irresistible food scenes born from the mingling of Southeast Asian and Chinese cultures over the centuries known here as Baba culture The arty island capital Phuket Town is the culinary epicenter A tin mining hub in the and centuries it s filled with candy colored Sino Portuguese buildings restored vintage shophouses and hidden shrines that burst into life during the September October Vegetarian Festival I like popping into the Lock Tien food court where Phuketian classics like mee hokkien Hokkien noodles and just made spring rolls are served at plastic tables or grabbing flaky roti bread topped with a fried egg at the always popular Thai Muslim breakfast spots on Thalang Rd Long running Mee Ton Poe is locally loved for its noodle dishes Kopitiam does Phuket style Thai classics and Raya prepares its popular coconutty crab curry in a tile covered Sino Portuguese house On the fine dining side try the contemporary Sardinian delights dreamt up by superstar chef Alessandro Frau at Acqua the elevated Phuketian flavors of Patongâ s gorgeous garden facing Ta Khai Cherngtalayâ s elegant Suay for chef Noi Tammasakâ s arty twist on Thai cuisine or Michelin starred PRU in northern Phuket Thereâ s plenty to enjoy on the local coffee scene too with hipster style hangouts such as Phuket Townâ s The Shelter Coffee and Bookhemian easily rivaling Chiang Mai â s famously cool cafe culture Phukety s weekend market is crammed with street food stands amongst the crafts stalls Getty Images Iâ ve happily spent time in Phuket with my brother my partner and many friends over the years but also as a solo female traveler Whether you fancy a beachfront yoga class heading out on a diving trip visiting Buddhist temples such as year old Wat Chalong or perhaps tackling the sport of muay Thai Thai boxing Phuketâ s activity calendar has it and all kinds of travelers can expect a warm welcome here Advertisement A signature Phuket highlight is escaping into gorgeous Ao Pha Nga Marine National Park Kayaking or paddle boarding is the most rewarding low impact way to explore this bewitching bay dotted with limestone karst formations Day trips to Ko Phi Phi â where travelers are permitted to visit gorgeous Maya Bay under strict conservation rules â are perfectly doable too And did you know thereâ s also great hiking in Phuket Rewarding routes include the sweaty jungle traversing climb up to the Big Buddha in the Nakkerd Hills near Kata as well as paths through the wild rainforests of northern Phuketâ s Khao Phra Thaew Royal Wildlife Forest Reserve â home to the pioneering Gibbon Rehabilitation Project Beaches in Phuket range from the busy to the blissfully calm Igor Bukhlin Shutterstock Beachfront bliss Nowhere does seductive beach hotels or heavenly spas like Phuket You could go all out with a deluxe stay at one of Thailandâ s top hideaways such as Amanpuri Trisara The Surin Phuket or Rosewood Phuket There are also fun sociable hostels and design forward boutique hotels particularly in Phuket Town Casa Blanca is a joy alongside mellow beachside guesthouses in places such as west coast Kamala Yet when Iâ m longing for this delicious island I think of an early morning stroll through Phuket Town a plastic plate of steaming noodles at a toes in the sand beach shack or a soul stirring swim in turquoise waves backed by rippling casuarinas This is what Phuket is all about No wonder the island has drawn people from all over the world for centuries The surf is always up on the beautiful island of Bali Getty Images Itâ d better be Bali If Mark Eveleigh were told he could only travel in one country for the rest of his life heâ d choose Indonesia This widely traveled journalist and author has written for numerous publications check out his travel book Kopi Dulu through Indonesia Overcrowded and overdeveloped Or the worldâ s most beautiful island I lean toward the latter The fabled Island of the Gods Bali certainly sees its fair share of tourists The town of Ubud a famous yoga haven and art capital has its dedicated devotees â as does Uluwatu with its sublime temple and adrenaline pumping surf Kuta was once party central even if the night owls are now heading to the beach clubs and cool cafes of Seminyak and booming Canggu Alongside five star resorts such as Raffles and the Four Seasons that sprawl through tropical gardens and spill onto talcum powder beaches visitors can stay in a host of exciting new designer places such as Lost Lindenberg and Nirjhara And even as demand soars you can still rent a simple comfortable room with a private balcony overlooking a tropical garden for under per night breakfast included So yes tourism might be booming here But on an island thatâ s over times the size of Phuket itâ s still astoundingly easy to find an unspoiled corner Beaches in Bali can be thronged or beguilingly empty Simon Long Getty Images Captivating culture and beguiling beaches Iâ m a big fan of Thailand and have worked on many assignments in that wonderful country But the colorful cast of gods and demons ghosts and witches that play such a large part in traditional Balinese life fascinate me â so much in fact that they became central characters in my latest novel Indeed itâ s the Balinese people that make the island uniquely appealing â not to mention one of the most culturally intriguing spots in the world When it comes to beaches Bali and Phuket both boast palm shaded white sand beaches that make visitors drool But only Bali has a law stipulating that no buildings can be tall enough to rise over those palm trees Even the most congested tourist centers here have been spared from high rise Thai style cityscapes In addition to the dreamy white beaches around Nusa Dua and the Bukit Peninsula there are also romantic volcanic beaches where you can stroll for miles across a surface that shimmers like a black mirror without seeing another holidaymaker If you enjoy dramatic wave smashed coastlines and some of the worldâ s best surfing then you should stick to the south coast if you prefer tranquil reefs that lure dolphins turtles and other marine life head to the sheltered north coast Ubud serves up vivid views of tumbling rice terraces at every turn Asyraf Rasid Shutterstock An island of natural delights When youâ ve had enough of beaches Baliâ s volcanic highlands offer a smorgasbord of activities that little Phuket could barely dream of The sunrise climb up Gunung Batur might be â justifiably â the most popular tour on the island along with the trip to Ubudâ s Monkey Forest Inland you can also cycle downhill for miles go whitewater rafting or explore jungles and peaks on foot by horse or even by helicopter In the island s unspoiled â wild west â you can walk with pink buffalo or visit what might be the planetâ s most photogenic traditional fishing fleet The arid hillsides of Northern Bali are planted with cashew dragon fruit and surprisingly even vineyards To the south the slopes are dominated by the giant stairways of terraced paddies in places running right down the ocean Traditional selerek fishing boats bob off the coast of Jembrana on Bali Denis Moskvinov Shutterstock I fell in love with Bali some two decades ago and my ideal writing retreat is tucked away on the remote western side of the island Every time I go back I realize anew that West Bali might be the most achingly beautiful place on the planet This third of the island remains almost entirely overlooked by visitors even the islanders themselves are often astounded to hear that West Bali National Park has deserted beaches where wild deer trot through the shallows and jungle clad hills that shelter hornbills flying foxes and slender langur monkeys There are lots of places in the world with plenty to occupy you for a two week vacation Twenty years after my first visit to Bali Iâ m still convinced that thereâ s enough here to keep me busy for a lifetime Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Thailand Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get
