mayhem Ryan Barrell May min read Share Oktoberfest s Hacker Pschorr tent is a joy filled meeting place for singing dancing and seemingly endless cold beer Â FooTToo Getty Oktoberfest once again returns September October for days of joyous beer swilling Every year more than seven million thirsty visitors descend on the German city of Munich for a two and a half week celebration featuring parades fair rides traditional food and music and of course lots of beer Oktoberfest can be an exciting event for outsiders to experience Bavarian culture but it can be hectic and difficult to navigate for the uninitiated particularly after a few liters of LÃ wenbrÃ u Especially this year as more crowds than ever will pack the festival grounds Donâ t fret â weâ ve got you covered with this guide to the festival of all festivals Advertisement How I traveled using Germanyâ s â travel pass my hour itinerary People in the colorful Spaten beer tent Â FooTToo Shutterstock Milling the grain since a brief history of Oktoberfest Oktoberfest began back in as a series of horse races honoring the marriage of Crown Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese of Saxe Hildburghausen It was such a big hit that it became an annual event with more activities popping up every year It wasnâ t until the late century that sausages and beer were served Nowadays the keg tapping and countless meaty morsels on offer are the most recognizable aspect of the event along with the traditional Bavarian garb Traveling to Germany questions you need to ask before you go Prost is how you say cheers in German Â kamisoka Getty Images The main attraction the millions of liters of beer The first thing to mention is the sheer volume of the alcohol â almost million liters of beer are served every year along with liters of wine Waitresses adorned with the traditional Dirndl and waiters donning Lederhosen ferry giant frothing mugs called Masskruege of beer to thirsty attendees Even this simple act is a spectacle as they are often carrying an unbelievable number at once â the current world record is for full Masskrug The top road trips in Germany for romance fairy tales castles and and possibly enchanted forests Carrying on the traditional dancing at Oktoberfest Â FooTToo Shutterstock All the great food that ll accompany the beer The second most exciting attraction is the food â Bavarians will typically begin a day at the Oktoberfest with some Weisswurst a white sausage consisting of veal and bacon meat Lunch might be half a rotisserie chicken Hendl a roasted pork knuckle drowned in gravy Schweinhaxen or even more sausages Throughout the day visitors who feel the pang of drunken hunger can snack on pretzels roasted almonds or a traditional shredded pancake dish called Kaiserschmarrn Advertisement Top national parks in Germany A marching band walks through the street during the Brewers Parade at the start of the festival Â Jesus Fernandez Shutterstock If you can still move after all that beer and food the festival also has various amusement rides traditional Bavarian folk music shows puppet shows and several parades to watch Regulars have also started a tradition of rolling down a large hill while inebriated Partake at your own risk This Oktoberfest raise a glass to Germany s Wine Queens The famed Marstall beer tent at Oktoberfest Â FooTToo Getty Oktoberfest etiquette essentials To make sure you donâ t make an Arsch of yourself at your first Oktoberfest follow locals and regular attendeeâ s simple doâ s and donâ ts DO Wear the right clothes Lederhosen and Dirndl are not compulsory but if youâ re going to commit you should go the whole hog Wearing your regular clothes wonâ t get you any unwanted attention and neither will the traditional garb but if you show up in a low quality bachelor party style fancy dress costume you risk offending quite a large number of the festivalâ s attendees Eat before you start drinking Thereâ s a reason the food served in the tents is so hefty and filling â it can be hard to track how many of those one litre Masskruege youâ re getting through Book a table Youâ ll have a much nicer experience and you wonâ t need to wait in the infamously long lines Aim for the tentsâ side entrances to avoid the lines Youâ ll still need to wait but maybe not as long Pay attention to how you tie your Dirndl Thereâ s a historical code based on the placement of the bow front right means youâ re married or in a relationship front left means youâ re single and ready to mingle and front middle means youâ re a virgin Yes this is still a thing despite it being the century Take cash There are very few ATMs available and you can expect to wait a sobering amount of time to withdraw some cash so youâ ll want to have some notes and coins with you Bear in mind that each beer is likely to cost between â and â Be prepared to hear Angels by Robbie Williams a lot Germany s best beaches A stroll through Oktoberfest s fairground Â FooTToo Getty DONâ T No matter how much of a good idea it might seem during the eight airing of Angels donâ t stand on the tables You donâ t want to be on the wrong side of an Oktoberfest security guard The Lebkuchenherzen gingerbread hearts may look cute but youâ re much better off grabbing some Kaiserschmarrn if youâ ve got hankering for something sweet Donâ t expect change from the wait staff They have seriously hectic jobs so any remainder from the cost of your drinks is assumed to be a tip Donâ t leave it too late to book accommodation With seven million people in attendance the rooms are booked up quickly Camping is another option or you could consider staying a bit further from the city and commuting to the festival After several drinks and sausages do not visit the bumper cars or amusement rides This should go without saying but you wonâ t want to be strapped into a seat feet in the air when your beer decides to come back up Donâ t drive Parking is a nightmare and if youâ re planning to sample the regionâ s beautiful beers you wonâ t be able to drive home anyway Donâ t be surprised by people snorting things all around you â sniffing tobacco is quite common in Bavaria and since smoking isnâ t allowed in the tents youâ ll often see people having a little sniff stunning places to visit in Germany Make time to experience other parts of Bavaria s culture on
