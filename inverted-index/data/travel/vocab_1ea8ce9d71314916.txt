wi fi and mobile networks Nick Ray Jan min read Share Cambodia has three leading mobile networks Use this guide to help you stay connected while traveling Nelson Antoine Shutterstock Cambodia is now an essential stop on the travel map of Southeast Asia thanks in large part to the one and only Angkor Wat Beyond Angkor lie unspoilt beaches soporific riverside towns remote national parks and some of the most untamed roads in the region Locate yourself front and center on the digital map with a reliable connection to the rest of the world while you travel through the kingdom Cambodia has some of the highest roaming charges in the region so save your hard earned money for some life changing experiences better than life changing bills with this lowdown on cell phones mobiles wi fi eSIMs and staying connected Will my phone work in Cambodia The short answer is yes but the long answer is a bit more complicated and usually involves some very stiff roaming charges If you opt to use roaming every time you make a call send a text message use data for online browsing emailing or messaging you will be charged by your provider back home Cambodia s major cities like Phnom Penh have good connectivity Getty Images Advertisement Data usage can quickly tick up if you are streaming films or television series watching video recommendations or navigating a city with online maps One gigabyte GB of data only lasts for about an hour if you are watching streaming platforms like Netflix Apple or Amazon or even Youtube and Tiktok videos However it will last a lot longer if you are only using it to check emails and send WhatsApp messages If you are a borderline smartphone addict that likes to capture every aspect of your trip for socials then be aware that roaming can burn a big hole in your travel budget Passes are available with rates varying from provider to provider Verizon offers a country pass to Cambodia for US per day with unlimited data talk and text while T Mobile offers data for US per day What mobile networks are available in Cambodia Cambodia is home to three leading mobile networks in the shape of Cellcard Smart and Metfone There is not a huge amount to choose between them but it can be worth doing your homework on special offers and data bundles before you arrive in country Cambodia has a high level of mobile coverage with of the country covered by networks and of the country covered by networks is yet to launch in Cambodia but testing is well underway so it should be introduced to major cities during Most of the major players have affordable tourist SIM cards available which range from about US for for days to US for for days As a general rule Metfone has the widest coverage in rural areas Smart has the fastest cover and Cellcard has the fastest overall coverage Cambodia has surprisingly good service even in some more remote locations Aleksandar Todorovic Shutterstock How can I get a local SIM card Local sim cards are widely available in Cambodia including at airport kiosks where they can be installed by helpful staff If buying a sim later on the trip use one of the official cell phone provider stores to ensure itâ s legit and comes with the right data bundle It is no longer necessary to show your passport when purchasing a SIM card in Cambodia Most will come with some sort of attached data bundle valid for anything from one week to one month It is a good idea to double check that the SIM card is working before you leave the kiosk or shop and take note of the phone number in case you need to share it with family or friends Is eSIM available in Cambodia and how does it work An even more straightforward option than the local SIM card is a virtual eSIM card Just choose a provider and plan make the online purchase scan the QR code provided and follow the instructions on your phone to activate the card Set it up before arriving in Cambodia and you will be ready to use mobile data as soon as you arrive in the kingdom Cambodia eSIM plans are tailored to provide the amount of data and duration that suits your travel requirements Helpfully unlike physical SIM cards eSIMs don t require the removal of your current SIM which means you can still receive calls and messages on your regular number while using your eSIM for data Most iPhone and Android devices are compatible with eSIMs but be sure to double check with your device specifications All the local providers offer Cambodia eSIM cards but we recommend Saily as our eSIM partner Use the code to receive off your Saily mobile data plan Costs to use Saily in Cambodia start at US for for days Advertisement Expect to find free wi fi in many bars restaurants and cafes throughout your travels in Cambodia Shutterstock Where can I find reliable wi fi in Cambodia The three international airports Phnom Penh International Airport PNH Siem Reap Angkor International Airport SAI and Sihanoukville International Airport KOS all have reliable wi fi There is no free government wi fi as found in some countries but most cafes restaurants and bars will offer free wi fi for customers as Cambodians need their regular fix All hotels hostels and guesthouses offer free wi fi these days although not necessarily those that are located in very remote areas of the country If you know that you will be traveling in remote areas or wi fi wastelands then plan ahead and download your offline maps playlists podcasts videos and current reads When it comes to cyber security be very careful about checking any sensitive information such as online banking or password protected accounts over public networks as there could be hackers hoping to obtain access to your online details Be particularly wary in Sihanoukville a renowned hotspot for criminal cyber scammers How fast and reliable is the internet According to the Speedtest website as of Cambodia currently ranks in the world for mobile speeds and in the world for fixed broadband speeds There are plans to rollout a network in the next year or so which should see internet speeds improve dramatically Coverage is pretty good in remote areas but the availability of wi fi may dry up as you travel further from the major centers In this case an international eSIM like Saily or a good local SIM is recommended If you are on a multi day trek into the national parks of Cambodia you may well struggle to get online One other curve ball to keep in mind is the coming of the rainy season or monsoon which usually falls between June and October as the intense downpours and jagged lightning can affect connectivity across all the networks Mobile internet coverage is likely to be more stable during the cool season from November to February or the hot season from March to May Are there any internet restrictions or censorship laws The internet is fairly open in Cambodia compared with China and some of the neighboring countries in Southeast Asia However some media websites have been blocked if they are openly critical of the governing Cambodian Peopleâ s Party CPP such as Voice of America VOA and The Cambodia Daily VPNs are legal in Cambodia and can be easily accessed provided you have a strong signal Many remote areas like Koh Rong Island in the Sihanoukville Province might have limited connectivity Getty Can I stay connected at major tourist sites Connectivity at leading attractions in the larger cities like Phnom Penh Siem Reap Kampot and Battambang is a piece of cake The temples of Angkor can be a bit more half baked depending on how far you venture afield and even central complexes like Angkor Thom sometimes have sticky spots due to the dense jungle Similarly some of the Southern Islands have areas with very spotty coverage Will I encounter language barriers when getting connected Leading providers like Cellcard Smart and Metfone all have English language websites and apps Helpline and customer service staff speak some English although for walk in stores the language level is likely to drop as you move further away from major centers How much does it cost to stay connected in Cambodia The most expensive option to stay connected in Cambodia is roaming with your home provider which starts at US per day for with T Mobile When it comes to eSIMs like Saily it costs US for of data lasting seven days The cheapest option is the tourist SIM card which start at about US for for days with new deals emerging every few months due to cutthroat competition There are no wi fi passes available in Cambodia as most hospitality businesses offer free wi fi for their customers or guests What local tech customs or etiquette should I be aware of Cambodia uses a mix of sockets Two pin flat sockets like the US Type A are very common as are the European rounded two pin sockets Type C Many newer hotels hostels cafes restaurants and bars will have multi plug sockets that can take any type of plug When it comes to phone etiquette most Cambodians will answer their phone at any time in any place whether or not they are with family or friends Cinemas and theaters thankfully remind customers to turn their phones to silent mode during the show Voice messaging is extremely popular with Cambodians so expect to see people having one way conversations with their phones using Telegram or WhatsApp Headphones are less common than in some parts of the world so be prepared for people to be watching videos on public transport with the soundtrack turned up to There is no such thing as a silent carriage in Cambodia How do I contact emergency services if needed In the event of an emergency use the following numbers Police Fire Ambulance There are also English speaking Tourism Police on hand to assist foreigners in Cambodia and they can be reached on in Phnom Penh or on in Siem Reap Any useful apps to download for my Cambodia trip Cambodia e Arrival This is the official immigration app for visitors to Cambodia and all visitors should complete the e arrival information before landing in Cambodia Grab Like the Uber of Southeast Asia Grab is an easy to use transport app for booking taxis and tuk tuks A popular food delivery app that will ensure you never go hungry in Cambodia This article was produced by Lonely Planet as part of our partnership with Saily Lonely Planet s advice and opinions are solely our own Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
