structures for measuring the heavens at the Jantar Mantar Isaji Getty Images Other sights near the City Palace Several other important sights are clustered close to the City Palace Just east of the Virendra Pol gate is the glorious Jantar Mantar constructed in on the orders of the scientifically curious Jai Singh II This collection of fantastical objects was used to measure the movements of celestial objects â stairs to nowhere climb over calibrated crescents dangling rings function as astrolabes and marble lined basins allow precise calculations of the movements of the spheres To the west of the palace is the towering Isarlat minaret erected in the by Sawai Iswari Singh the viewing gallery at the top offers excellent views over the City Palace There are similarly impressive palace views from the century Hawa Mahal â aka Palace of the Winds â an extraordinary residence fronted by a delicate honeycomb of fretwork and stained glass windows that allowed the ladies of the royal household to secretly peek out at the jostle of city life My favorite thing to do at the City Palace Iâ m a huge fan of the City Palace armory for the glimpse it offers behind the curtain of the elaborate pageantry and layered etiquette of Rajput royal life As well as being lavishly ornamented royal weapons were brutally functional intended to be secreted under robes and pulled out if a peace treaty meeting turned sour or an official audience turned out to be an ambush Is the City Palace accessible Being mostly on one flat level the City Palace is one of the more accessible sights in Rajasthan Travelers with limited mobility including wheelchair users will be able to visit the main courtyards and museum buildings with few difficulties The royal armory is upstairs however and visiting the Chandra Mahal involves navigating steps and narrow corridors This article was adapted from Lonely Planetâ s India guidebook published in November Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
