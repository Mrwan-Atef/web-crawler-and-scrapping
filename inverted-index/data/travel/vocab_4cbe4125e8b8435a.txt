GarcÃ a Dec min read Share A little local knowledge can help you on your way to a perfect trip to Puerto Rico J Erick Brazzan Shutterstock With breathtaking oceanfront vistas lush breezy mountains tropical rainforest some pumping nightlife and one of the coolest food scenes in the Caribbean a Puerto Rico vacation is all about enjoying the ride Learning a few of the island s unspoken social rules will go a long way to helping you enjoy the vibe and understanding what makes Puerto Rico such a memorable spot for your vacation So whether you re hiking surfing zip lining boogie boarding or heading to one of the island s many festivals here are our top tips on planning etiquette and health and safety in Puerto Rico Check the visa rules and passport requirements While Puerto Rico is its own country and local laws and customs differ from those of the United States the island is still a Commonwealth of the USA This means US citizens donâ t require a passport or a visa for entry Flights from the US are considered domestic so you wonâ t go through customs when you arrive on the island and you wonâ t need to present a visa or pay a departure tax when you leave Advertisement However visitors must still pay the local tax of on goods and services and youâ ll be required to pass through the US Department of Agriculture channel at the airport before you leave just to make sure you donâ t bring fruits or vegetables or open food packets back into the US Non US citizens taking a trip to Puerto Rico may need to apply for a day visa before arrival but countries that are part of the US Visa Waiver Program wonâ t need a visa thanks to international agreements Check out this list to see what countries are part of the program and which have visa requirements To explore beyond San Juan and the beaches rent a car OGphoto Getty Images Rent a car for long distance road trips when traveling in Puerto Rico When planning a trip to Puerto Rico it s necessary to know that public transportation often falls short Keep this in mind when planning how long you want to stay The bulk of the San Juan metropolitan area â comprising the municipalities of San Juan and some parts of Carolina â is served by buses run by Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses AMA but the routes and pick up times are unreliable A road trip to the beautiful central mountain range the beaches of the northwest or the southwestern desert requires a rental car Cars can go up or down in price depending on the season but youâ ll get more out of your trip if youâ re driving as you can make all the stops you need to take photographs at the amazing miradores lookout points sprinkled along Expressway in the north or Route in the northwest If traveling to Puerto Rico don t miss its bioluminescent bays Omark Reyes Getty Images Donâ t expect to see the whole island in one trip Puerto Rico is miles long and miles wide but don t let that fool you â the geography is anything but small in scale and there are many things you ll want to do while you re there The island has a surface area of sq miles and white sandy beaches are only one of the natural wonders youâ ll experience in Puerto Rico Visitors can marvel at bioluminescent bays caves that are thousands of years old and adorned with Taino hieroglyphics and a wealth of rivers canyons high mountain peaks and salt flats While a lot of tourist attractions and popular bars are in San Juan real Puerto Rican culture is often best encountered in places outside of the metropolitan area It can take up to three hours to get from one side of the island to the other and there are bound to be some roads that are either closed or temporarily closed for repairs Traveling from one end of the island to the other can be a breeze if you use the expressways or it can be a long rollercoaster ride via the islandâ s beautiful backroads Expect delays due to construction and improvement work along major highways and be prepared for epic traffic jams during the peak commuter hours from to and to In Puerto Rico locals can be conservative in what they wear so always check the dress code before you head out Alejandro Granadillo for Lonely Planet Pack bathing suits and your Sunday best As a former Spanish colony Puerto Rico was left with a legacy of Spanish colonial practices including widespread Catholicism also common in other nearby Latin American countries such as Cuba and the Dominican Republic Perhaps unsurprisingly Puerto Ricans tend to be quite conservative when it comes to dress codes and the places where these apply In Old San Juan â where the governorâ s mansion La Fortaleza is located â itâ s common to see workers in full suits or long shirts regardless of the tropical heat Flip flops are usually reserved for the beach or super casual situations such as trips to kiosks and beachside restaurants or riverside walks Youâ ll stick out like a sore thumb if you show up at the main mall Plaza las AmÃ ricas in your swimsuit Advertisement Some clubs have dress codes too requiring men and women to wear smart shoes Pack your bathing suit and flip flops but also bring some dressy outfits for going out at night and clothes that cover the knees and shoulders if you plan to visit any religious sites Buy tickets ahead for tours and attractions If youâ re planning to join a snorkeling trip go on a catamaran tour or eat at the Restaurant in the Vanderbilt Hotel book your spot ahead of time Trust us planning ahead will be a game changer Donâ t expect everyone to speak English Regardless of Puerto Ricoâ s modern political status Spanish remains the language most widely spoken on the island While youâ ll find plenty of Puerto Ricans who speak near perfect English you re most likely to meet these people in the metropolitan area and peripheral cities such as Caguas Guaynabo Carolina and Trujillo Alto Even in Old San Juan where restaurant and tourism industry workers will speak to you in English without a problem itâ s considerate to ask someone if they speak English before continuing If you re venturing outside of the main tourist zones brush up on your Spanish be patient and courteous and youâ ll make fast friends with island residents Discuss local politics with care in Puerto Rico not everyone is singing the same tune Colvin Getty Images Discuss politics with care Conversations about the island s political situation can get heated and emotional â the subject of the islands status is a controversial one and Puerto Ricans views vary widely The best approach is to come to these conversations with an open mind and remember that Puerto Rican politics and US politics are incredibly different There s much to be gained by just listening to Puerto Ricans stories and hopes for what they want to see the island become in the future Ensure you sample the excellent Puerto Rico cuisine Alejandro Granadillo for Lonely Planet Be ready to sample the full range of Puerto Rican cuisine Donâ t let the tasty street snacks â pernil roast pork alcapurrias stuffed fried fritters and bacalaitos codfish fritters â steal all your attention While these traditional and delicious foods are prevalent Puerto Rican cuisine is vast and complicated with influences that range from West Africa to Spain and Asia Youâ ll find vegetarian friendly restaurants such as vegan cafe El Grifo in Caguas and HP in San Juan Then there s the fine dining experience at the internationally renowned Restaurant inside the Vanderbilt Hotel in Condado or the French restaurant Trois Cent Onze Puerto Rico has a host of extraordinarily talented home grown chefs and wonderful influences from other countries such as the island s ubiquitous Puerto Rican Chinese restaurants which are typically family run and cozy Come for the mofongo mashed fried plantains and pernil but stay for the surprising breadth of culinary experiences that await in Puerto Rico Be ready for the real â island timeâ Itâ s tempting to think of Puerto Rico as a laid back escape where the majority of the time is spent going to the beach or hanging around in the sun The reality is that the island is centered on a busy metropolitan city with people rushing to work early in the morning and traffic jams at the end of long workdays If you need to do any errands plan ahead because government offices fast food restaurants bakeries and supermarkets will almost always have long lines Making a scene or looking exasperated because the cashier took a little bit more time than usual will most likely earn you some dirty looks Youâ re on vacation enjoy the slower pace and go with the flow Youâ ll soon learn the art of Puerto Rican small talk and taking a breather while you wait You don t have to avoid a trip to Puerto Rico during hurricane season but stay informed Discover Puerto Rico Be aware of the hurricane season Hurricane season in the Caribbean runs from June to November and while Puerto Rico isnâ t typically hit by hurricanes when they do hit they can be devastating When booking hotels and plane tickets during hurricane season always check with your airline about their natural disaster policies If you get stuck in Puerto Rico during a hurricane your hotel will likely have an emergency plan Tourists are well taken care of on the island so ask your lodging about contingency measures before you go This is not to say you canâ t travel during the hurricane season â indeed June to November is one of the most wonderful seasons on the island Just keep an eye on the news and monitor your favorite weather app for warnings of approaching storms Petty crime can be a risk on some urban beaches at night Martin Wheeler Getty Images Exercise caution on Puerto Rico s beaches Beaches in Puerto Rico are beautiful with crisp white sand and crystal clear waters for all to enjoy However there are usually no lifeguards on duty and if youâ re staying on the Atlantic coast in the north the ocean tends to be choppier compared to the mild waves of the Caribbean in the south You can usually spot rip currents and whirlpools by the appearance of the surface of the water which will look different from the water where waves are moving towards the beach Donâ t panic if you do get caught in one â the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA recommends conserving your energy and swimming parallel to the shore until you get out of the current While rip currents can be deadly they rarely pull people under the water just away from the shore Exercise caution when swimming with children and if you see a patch of water or a beach thatâ s completely empty thatâ s usually for a reason This could be jellyfish spiky sea urchins or strong undercurrents When visiting the beach donâ t bring flashy jewelry expensive cameras or leave purses out in the open as pickpockets can be an issue on high traffic tourist beaches such as Ocean Park and Isla Verde When out at night take similar precautions as you would in any major city Alejandro Granadillo for Lonely Planet Exercise the same caution you would use in a big city back home Puerto Rico is generally safe for travelers but keep an eye out for risks such as dark empty streets in Old San Juan and other San Juan neighborhoods In particular exercise caution when venturing out to clubs in Santurce â this is a high crime area at night Some beaches in urban areas arenâ t safe to hang out at night either Thereâ s no police presence and these beaches tend to be hidden behind hotels and residences with little to no lighting providing an excellent opportunity for petty crime Research the area where youâ re staying and try to speak to someone who already lives there or has visited to gauge safety levels Don t skimp on sunblock the Caribbean sun can hit hard Alejandro Granadillo for Lonely Planet Donâ t skimp on sunblock and bug spray Caribbean sunlight can hit hard if youâ re not used to it The islands are close to the equator and get hit directly by the sun with noon to being the most punishing hours of the day Donâ t skimp on sunblock â aim for or higher â and you ll avoid nasty burns Any local will tell you that bugs â especially mosquitoes â are a nuisance on summer nights In the worst cases they can also carry tropical diseases such as dengue fever Zika and chikungunya Your best protection against bugs is to wear a lot of DEET based bug spray especially in areas close to bodies of sitting water such as mangroves lagoons and lakes Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get
