incredible experiences zevana Shutterstock Africa offers experiences found nowhere else on Earth Each year the Great Migration sees millions of mammals traverse Tanzania and Kenya in one of nature s greatest spectacles and you can witness it up close on a safari tour But the continent extends far beyond its wildlife Sail the Nile on elegant cruise ships explore South Africa s scenic Garden Route or trek Morocco s mountains and ancient medinas Here are seven journeys from our new book Dream Trips of the World that showcase the range of adventures you can enjoy across this vast continent Sail down the Nile in Egypt All the historical romance and melancholy of ancient Egypt can be found on a journey down the Nile Adventure here can take several forms â be it on the deck of a white sailed felucca the traditional Egyptian sailing pontoon or on board a more elaborate cruise ship equipped with swimming pool and on call Egyptologists ready to unpick every riddle and notoriously difficult hieroglyphs The cabin cruiser MS Mayflower offers well priced itineraries but if you re looking for style glamour try the Sanctuary Sunboat IV Luxury Cruise Advertisement Once on your boat spend a couple of days sailing slowly north with desert towns At Kom Ombo learn about the ancient Egyptian calendar and the early days of medicine even the pharaohs went in for cosmetic surgery before rural life takes over by the time you reach Edfu home to the great Temple of Horus When stopping at Luxor see Karnak the most storied temple of the lot and the Valley of the Kings Pro tip The gateway for northbound Nile trips is Aswan well connected to main hubs Cairo and Luxor by air rail and road Then itâ s onto your desert ship â thereâ s no need to sail all the way to Cairo as most operators only cover the stretch between Aswan and Luxor The Great Migration is often billed as the greatest wildlife spectacle on Earth Photo Africa SA Shutterstock Follow the herds on the Great Migration in Kenya and Tanzania The Great Migration on the savannah plains of Tanzaniaâ s Serengeti and Kenyaâ s Masai Mara is one of natureâ s last truly wild spectacles Following instincts honed over millennia the herds of nearly two million wildebeest and zebra seemingly moving as one follow the rains and grasslands on their endless quest for survival stalked all the while by predators Following this quest and this contest is a journey into the storied nostalgia of the East African safari Sleep under canvas and listen to lions roaring in the night Sip G Ts as elephant families move like cloud shadows across the landscape Then watch in wonder as the sun sets in a great ball of fire behind a silhouetted acacia Pro tip The best time to witness the Great Migration is between April and October though different stages can be experienced throughout the year Book your safari months in advance regardless of when you plan to go Stop near Knysna along the Garden Route for beautiful ocean scenery Chiara Salvadori Getty Images Visit Cape Town and drive the Garden Route South Africa A stay in Cape Town pairs naturally with a visit to the nearby winelands On a longer visit take a scenic road trip along the famous Garden Route a drive that starts in Mossel Bay miles east of Cape Town and continues east Explore a strip of beaches lagoons and forests around the town of Knysna The region s mild climate means year round adventures like the Tsitsikamma Canopy Tour Storms River Suspension Bridge walks and gorge exploration by kayak and lilo Advertisement After taking in the Garden Routeâ s many delights most visitors zip back to the city along the but crossing the Outeniqua Pass to the ostrich farming Oudtshoorn area offers a slower return through the semi arid Little Karoo where fruit orchards and vineyards unfurl between the Swartberg and Langeberg Mountains Follow Rte west to Montagu stopping for farm stall dried peaches along the way before ending your journey at a peaceful farmstay under starlit skies Pro tip In Cape Town visit the Old Biscuit Mill in arty Woodstock for local craftwork and homewares as well as the Neighbourgoods food and design market on weekends The village of Tacheddirt is one of the stops on the Toubkal circuit Jan Jerman Shutterstock Trek mountains and explore medinas in Morocco The AÃ t Bougmez Valley in Morocco s High Atlas is a world away from the chaos and bustle of Marrakesh s souqs reached by a half day drive or two day journey via Azilal on public or shared transport Here traditional rural life melds with trekking trails including the three day traverse of the M Goun massif to AÃ t Ali N Ito Explore Tabant s Sunday souq experience village life or hike to seasonal Lac Izoughar on the valley s eastern edge The mile M Goun Traverse can be split over three days with a final night at AÃ t Ali N Ito or continue directly to the village of Imlil â either a half day drive or two day journey via Demnate and Marrakesh on public transport After a rest day in Imlil set out on the seven day Toubkal Circuit â a mile loop that winds past the thundering Cascades d Irhoulidene and the stone houses of Azib Tamsoult hamlet Finally make the short drive back to Marrakesh to trade in your backpack for a shopping bag and dive into the chaos of the medina and souqs After a few days bargaining on the Djemaa El Fna by day and soaking in historic hammams by night itâ ll already be time for the next adventure Pro tip While officially mandatory only for treks in the Toubkal region seeing the High Atlas with a local guide will facilitate a deeper cultural experience particularly in the villages where Amazigh languages are spoken Have a magical encounter with an elephant as you float through the waters of Botswana s Okavango Delta Martin Mecnarowski Shutterstock Take a boat safari through the Okavango in Botswana Drift gondola style through the watery channels of Botswana â s UNESCO World Heritage listed Okavango Delta one of Africaâ s largest concentrations of wildlife in a wooden dugout canoe While you move at the whim of quiet currents steering clear of hippos you might encounter an elephant swimming or drinking quietly by the reeds Birds known as skimmers make the barest ripple as they pluck insects from the surface If youâ re lucky youâ ll hear a lion roaring off in the distance So magical are such moments that here in the worldâ s largest inland delta you could be forgiven for wondering if youâ ve found Eden And at the end of your watery adventure youâ ll return to where you began to a cluster of safari tents on an island accessible only by boat Pro tip Plan to visit from May to September when water levels are ideal for boat safaris Book your safari through Safari Bookings The nine inhabited islands of Cabo Verde offer a fantastic variety of landscapes Igor Tichonow Shutterstock Cruise between the islands of Cabo Verde Every island is a world unto its own in Cabo Verde On Fogo signs of the islandâ s active volcano are everywhere on black sand beaches in lava fields surrounding abandoned villages and in the farmlands where the rich soil nurtures the archipelagoâ s best vineyards Boa Vista by contrast resembles a strange collision of Sahara and Caribbean â a parched interior home to the wind whipped dunes of the Viana Desert and golden beaches lapped by turquoise seas Once youâ ve set foot on its soft sands youâ ll agree that Praia de Santa ranks among the worldâ s most beautiful beaches Though formed by the same volcanic forces the island of Santo AntÃ o feels far removed from Boa Vistaâ s sunbaked flatlands with craggy peaks rising above lush canyons and meandering river valleys Trekking here is epic with challenging hikes amid waterfalls hillside villages and dramatic viewpoints Cabo Verdeâ s other inhabited islands nine in all are sprinkled with equally diverse landscapes â along with enchanting music filled cities like Mindelo adding another reason to make this trip Pro tip Various ferry companies including CV Interilhas connect neighboring islands â and less frequently distant islands BestFly Cabo Verde flies between islands Victoria Falls is one of Africa
