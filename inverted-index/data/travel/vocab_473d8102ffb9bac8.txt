The beach at Lake Caldonazzo Italy Florian Augustin Shutterstock Europe s coastlines and astounding beaches may get all the attention as summer comes to the northern hemisphere but the continent s lakes should not be overlooked Italy boasts glamorous mountain ringed waters Croatia offers up saltwater sensations and England is home to moody pastoral scenes Whether you want to swim SUP cycle or chill out on the beach Europe has a lake for every kind of adventure We asked our expert writers to share their favorite lakes for a holiday in Europe â here is their pick of the best Lake Levico Italy Alberto Masnovo Shutterstock Lake Levico and Lake Caldonazzo Italy Recommended by Daniel James Clarke Advertisement Trentino s legendary Lake Garda and cloud defying Dolomites need little introduction But hidden between these headliners is unsung Valsugana harboring its pair of pristine rivals Lake Levico Lago di Levico the smaller of the two is a fjord like fantasy narrow squeaky clean waters flanked by sloping pines It s also one of Europe s warmest lakes Motorized water sports are prohibited meaning the Blue Flag beach and shore tracking paths are soundtracked solely by birdsong Embrace the stillness and go SUPing gliding over mirror like waters and sunken treasure â chests of sparkling Trentodoc wine mature below Meet the characterful brothers behind these aquatic vinos at Cantina Romanese for a scuba free vineyard tasting Adrenaline needed Cross to neighboring Lake Caldonazzo Lago di Caldonazzo where world champion Tomas Degasperi leads exhilarating waterski lessons Back on dry land iron rich thermal spas a stargazing observatory and the open air forested sculpture gallery Arte Sella await Then there s all the food Pizza pasta and gelato are a given â lakeside Gelateria Bellavista is sweet tooth heaven â but don t overlook the regional Italian Austrian flavors such as canederli cheese stuffed bread dumplings The best part Unlike Italy s upscale mansion lined lakes Valsugana s camping grounds agriturismos farm stays and wellness resorts accommodate all budgets The town of Malcesine on the shores of Italy s Lake Garda Lukasz Szwaj Shutterstock Lake Garda Italy Recommended by Julia Buckley Itâ s big enough to resemble the seaside and is fringed by picture perfect villages and dotted with archaeological sites Lake Garda Lago di Garda is Italy in beautiful miniature Its mild Mediterranean climate â the only one of Italyâ s lakes to have one â means that fragrant lemon groves blossom by the shoreline while hotels cling to the sunny cliffsides Thereâ s something for everyone here Archaeology lovers will want to head to Sirmione the snake shaped peninsula jutting into the south of the lake where thereâ s a Roman villa and spa on the waterfront to go even further back in time at the far north end youâ ll find the remains of year old huts at the tiny Lake Ledro suspended in the mountains just behind the northwestern corner of Garda Fans of more recent history will be fascinated by the Vittoriale degli Italiani the outrÃ home of the controversial early century writer Gabriele dâ Annunzio â the sprawling grounds contain a warship in the garden If you want to visit towns and villages thereâ s stately Desenzano del Garda and pretty Lazise and Limone sul Garda Leading northwards from Limone is a walkway and cycle path cantilevered over the still water Want to get closer Rent a boat to zip around the lake at will Boating on Lake Constance Daniel Harwardt Shutterstock Lake Constance Germany Austria and Switzerland Recommended by Luke Waterson Central Europeâ s second largest freshwater body of water after Lake Geneva Lake Constance laps at the borders of Austria Germany and Switzerland Its shores are encircled by a mile cycle path that combined with the use of cross lake ferries lets you experience all three countries in as little as a single day making it one of the worldâ s most culturally fascinating lakes Advertisement Vibrant arts hub Bregenz is the toast of the Austrian lakeside with a cable car climbing to the peak of PfÃ nder for the most dramatic lake overview Around German Lake Constance ogle Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen an open air museum featuring reconstructed ancient lake dwellings or the hulking fortress of Burg Meersburg with its drawbridge and dungeons You can also voyage to Mainau near Konstanz a garden island that dazzles with its Mediterranean flowers elaborate topiaries and a Baroque castle Sojourn to Switzerlandâ s swathe of the lake stopping in at picturesque settlements like medieval Stein am Rhein with its winsome half timbered buildings Just because it s rich in cultural experiences doesnâ t mean the lake lacks in the delightful countryside get away from it all by strolling vineyards near Meersburg or hiking hilly trails around PfÃ nder Veliko Jezero on the Croatian island of Mljet Lottie Davies Lonely Planet Malo Jezero and Veliko Jezero Croatia Recommended by John Garry Can t decide between lakeside or seafront Consider Mljet â an island so enchanting Odysseus of mythological fame stayed for seven years Homer s Odyssey credits the nymph Calypso for his extended stint but we d like to believe the island s two saltwater lakes did the trick â Malo Jezero Little Lake and Veliko Jezero Big Lake Take a boat trip on Veliko Jezero to Sveta Marija St Mary s Island where a century Benedictine monastery rises from the blue or rent a kayak to paddle the perimeter at your own pace The real treat however is jumping in the water Mljet s lakes are warmer than the sea â particularly Malo Jezero Dive deep enough and you can spot sea cucumbers giant clams and the endemic Aurelia jellyfish a harmless invertebrate Both lakes line Mljet National Park â a hectare preserve thick with Aleppo pine and holm oak Hiking the park makes a fine day trip from Dubrovnik two hours away by ferry but with a setting this seductive you might wind up pulling an Odysseus Plan on resting your head at the aptly named Hotel Odisej Mljet which overlooks the Adriatic The Church of the Assumption on Lake Bled Slovenia Andrea Comi Getty Images Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj Slovenia Recommended by Mark Baker Lakes tend to be drop dead gorgeous or loads of fun to splash around in â but rarely both Slovenia solves this problem nicely with two incredible lakes â Bled and Bohinj â just km miles apart With its dramatic alpine backdrop Lake Bled is the looker while larger Lake Bohinj lined by kayak and SUP rental outfits is the fun one but truth be told itâ s a beautiful body of water as well Start your exploration with a walk around Lake Bled and a visit to grand Bled Castle Hire a pletna a wooden boat that resembles a Venetian gondola and sail out to tiny magical Bled Island Before leaving treat yourself to a piece of kremÅ nita Bledâ s legendary cream cake The restaurant at Bled Castle makes a good one Over at Lake Bohinj in addition to swimming and kayaking you can hike around the lake rent bikes or even go horseback riding in the surrounding hills Hotel Bohinj a restored lodge at the lakeside hamlet of RibÄ ev Laz is equal parts sumptuous and wacky but spares no expense spoiling its guests The chefs at Restaurant Triglav work wonders with locally sourced Bohinj trout which diners often mistake for salmon because of the meatâ s pinkish color A cyclist taking a break near Lac D Annecy France oliverdelahaye Shutterstock Lac dâ Annecy France Recommended by Kerry Walker One minute youâ re gazing in wonder at the wild snow dusted French Alps and the next itâ s as though youâ ve been teleported to another time and place on the palm rimmed promenade ribboned shores of Lac dâ Annecy Lake Annecy A splash south of Geneva this dazzler of a glacier carved spring fed lake in Haute Savoie is Franceâ s fourth biggest and Europeâ s purest honestly your bath water is no cleaner The town of Annecy at the lakeâ s northern cusp is the springboard for exploring and my is it pretty The Vieille Ville is bedtime story stuff with trickling canals and pastel painted houses harboring enticing bistros cafes and patisseries And the cake topper of a medieval castle once home to the counts of Geneva has degree views over the rooftops to the Massif des Bauges that will make you audibly sigh Good food Mais ouiâ Annecy has a galaxy of gourmet restaurants including three Michelin starred Le Clos des Sens After a romantic stint in town head to the lake to walk mountain bike swim row stand up paddleboard paraglide or simply crash on one of the beaches The under the radar mountains of Parc Naturel RÃ gional du Massif des Bauges and year old ChÃ teau de Menthon St Bernard make easy memorable day trips Verdon Gorge and Lac Sainte Croix France Romrodphoto Shutterstock Lac de Sainte Croix France Recommended by Chrissie McClatchie Look at a map of Provence and youâ ll find Lac de Sainte Croix right at the center The gateway to the dramatic Gorges du Verdon aka the Grand Canyon of Europe this artificial lake is Franceâ s third largest Its beauty lies not only in the shock of opaque turquoise water or the activities that can be enjoyed from its sandy shores swimming boating windsurfing pedal boating canoeing kayaking and more but also in the magazine cover pretty villages that surround it that include Moustiers Saintes Maries which clings to a mountain miles away from the water s edge and Sainte Croix du Verdon If everything had gone according to plan when they flooded the Salles Valley to create the body of water in the late the latter would have become uninhabitable During the lavender season mid June to mid July combine a visit to Lac de Sainte Croix with a day in the fields of the Plateau de Valensole which starts a little bit further along the road north from Sainte Croix du Verdon Buttermere in the Lake District England Justin Foulkes Lonely Planet Buttermere and Crummock Water England Recommended by Tom Hall While neither are strictly speaking lakes â just look at their names â Buttermere and Crummock Water are the perfect places to experience the Lake District Their remote feeling location in the north of the national park relative lack of facilities and distance from the park s big name mountains Scafell Pike Helvellyn and Great Gable generally mean this is a quieter area than the busy south Lakes And so much the better for anyone who does get here the two bodies of water are fringed by towering mountains with only a few narrow lanes and dry stone walled fields to suggest any human influence Pack your walking boots to get the most out of being here If you re arriving in Buttermere Valley via the steep twists of Honister Pass access one of the best views in all of England by taking the short walk to the top of Fleetwith Pike from the Honister Slate Mine car park Or if youâ d prefer to remain at ground level thereâ s an easy mile circular stroll around Buttermere Both lakes are excellent for slightly chilly swims However you spend a day a pint at the Fish Inn is the perfect sundowner The and bus operate circular services for Buttermere Village from Keswick or stay overnight at Skye Farm Campsite or Buttermere YHA Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address Subscribe now Subscribe
