Oklahoma s Tallgrass Prairie Preserve is one of the last remnants of an American landscape TRAVEL TRAVELER This is one of the last remnants of American prairie In Oklahoma s Osage County the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve safeguards herds of bison flocks of birds and breathtaking grassland At least million acres of grass once stretched across the land that became the United States Today the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve protects acres of what remains of that prairie Photograph by MORGAN HEIM By Robert Earle Howells March min read An unbroken landscape of grasses and wildflowers stretches as far as the eye can see punctuated only by a collection of dots on a distant hill It s a herd of bison my binoculars reveal What I can t see as I scan for miles is anything human made Before there were amber waves of grain there were tallgrass prairies At least million acres of grass covered the territory from Ohio to Kansas southern Texas to Canada nearly a third of what became the United States Today almost all of it is gone which is why this sight on the Nature Conservancy s Joseph H Williams Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in northeastern Oklahoma is such a treasure Most of the grasslands that greeted westward hoing pioneers gave way to corn and wheat and development But here a nearly pristine remnant remains thanks to a convergence of circumstances that resulted in the initial ownership of acres of protected prairie This vista is imprinted in my memory as one of the most profoundly moving in the country and I m thrilled to see it again When I first visited three decades ago there was no preserve only the dream of one Local ranch owners were willing to sell acres of prime land and the National Park Service was interested A deal was never finalized but in the Nature Conservancy engineered an audacious million capital campaign to purchase the acre Barnard Ranch and establish the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve Conservation and restoration were well underway when I returned in the mid Today thanks to additional purchases over the years some acres are protected One thing that hasn t changed since my first visit Harvey Payne a rancher attorney environmentalist remains one of the most dedicated advocates for the prairie and I m grateful to have him again as my guide all these years after our first walks on the edge of the unpreserved preserve After Payne spent years calling for a prairie preserve he became its manager for years He s retired from that duty now but retains the title of community relations coordinator and is happy to show me around and bring me up to date As a functioning ecosystem the tallgrass prairie as it existed historically is effectively extinct But this is the best semblance of the original that we have Harvey Payne Rancher attorney and environmentalist Payne and I meet in downtown Pawhuska population about the preserve s gateway town and one aspect of the prairie experience that has changed dramatically since my first visit Cooking show celebrity Ree The Pioneer Woman Drummond has opened The Pioneer Woman Mercantile in one of Pawhuska s historic brick buildings and the once sleepy town now regularly sees lines of fans stretching around the block eager to chow down in her eatery or shop for kitchen implements and tchotchkes A ripple effect has brought new galleries boutiques restaurants and lodgings to downtown Pawhuska For many visitors the prairie preserve is serendipity rather than the reason to visit this corner of the state The Pioneer Woman Mercantile in a renovated historic brick building on Main Street houses a store selling kitchenware and cookbooks and a restaurant serving comfort fare such as a meatloaf sandwich topped with fried onions Photographs by SHANE BEVEL Top Left and Photographs by SHANE BEVEL Bottom Right Pawhuska is also the seat of the Osage Nation and the Osage s story is deeply imprinted on these hills The Osage pressured by white homesteaders to sell their property in southeastern Kansas in purchased the hilly Oklahoma land for cents an acre and relocated to the prairie Karma kicked in when Osage County s first oil wells began producing circa Osage headrights title to the land s gas and minerals made the Osage almost instantly among the wealthiest people in the world As we drive north from town toward the preserve I ask Payne to refresh my memory as to how a former cattle ranch can qualify as pristine prairie Well first Payne says we can t call it pristine As a functioning ecosystem the tallgrass prairie as it existed historically is effectively extinct But this is the best semblance of the original that we have The prairie s nearly natural state is due to a quirk of geology The region is relentlessly rocky The grassy hills are undergirded by so much limestone and sandstone that it s difficult to walk on the prairie let alone plow it John Deere s finest steel could never bust this sod The Nature Conservancy manages the acre Joseph H Williams Tallgrass Prairie Preserve where wildflowers flourish and bison roam Photograph by HARVEY PAYNE So the Osage Hills became cattle country Cattle s impact on the land is far less than that of agriculture especially when ranchers are careful land managers as the preserve s former owners were Still cattle are aliens here The prairie s native ruminants were elk and bison After the elk were killed off around and the bison by ranching and cattle took over It s a far cry from a cow pasture to a prairie preserve Payne says We only need look out the window to see that The ranchland along the road to the preserve is lovely rolling pasture But when we enter the preserve the hills become a multifaceted work of art A tallgrass prairie is much more than grass Payne explains We ve identified more than species of flora on the preserve Of those are grasses The rest are broadleafs and sedges The cattle will eat some species of grass so much that the broadleafs they don t like take over Then some ranchers will engage in aerial spraying to kill these broadleaf plants Then away go the greater prairie chickens and ground nesting birds Payne s voice trails off Greater prairie chickens are one of the avian superstars here Their mating dances are legendary and something that Payne an avid photographer has documented for years His main point is that a true prairie is varied and abundant My days on the prairie were to become a constant discovery and rediscovery of that fact As we continue into the preserve it is obvious just how abundant a tallgrass prairie is It s early September when warm season grasses are at their tallest but we re not just talking about horizon to horizon big bluestem which reaches up to feet this time of year We also see shorter Indian grass with its feathery seed heads and little bluestem and some truly astounding displays of wildflowers We pull to the edge of the road beside acres of Leavenworth s eryngo one to three foot stalks with splashy purple thistlelike flowers and a herd of bison indifferently munching around the fringe of the field A lone giant post oak puts a strong stamp on the scene and meadowlarks flit all around Prairie is the preferred habitat for the American golden plover Just seeing America in its most simple form possible with green grass and rolling hills is a sight to behold says Truman Pipestem an aspiring lawyer and a member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians who is also Osage Otoe Missouria and Citizen Potawatomi Photograph by HARVEY PAYNE Bison tend to be scene stealers wherever they choose to graze and that s only right They re irresistible to watch Signs warn to keep one s distance from the massive wild beasts but I ll admit to cheating a bit Not that I m posing for selfies with them but I just like to stand nearby watch and anthropomorphize this one s grumpy this one s looking for affection how cute is that calf that guy he s huge When I visited some years ago the preserve had around bison Today some of them are scattered in groups like this freely grazing acres in the preserve A nearly mile circular driving route in the western part of the preserve the Bison Loop passes through prime bison pasture There s never a guarantee that bison will appear near the road but I see them every time I drive through Spring brings the arrival of bison calves a new generation to call the prairie home Photograph by HARVEY PAYNE Bison and cattle stimulate growth on the prairie by grazing the land but Payne tells me that would be for naught without fire In a method known as patch burning preserve managers torch about a third of the acreage every spring late summer and fall mimicking ancient seasons of fire and nature s way of rejuvenating nutritious new growth The hirsute beast I described as huge lumbers closer At nine years old he s a bit of an outlier Payne tells me Most bull bison are rounded up and sold at age six keeping the total herd size constant and healthy But a few escape that fate We continue to watch mesmerized for a while Then Payne remarks When the tail comes up like that it means either charge or discharge We don t wait to find out which After our daylong reunion tour of the preserve Payne leaves me some sage advice for the next few days Appreciating the prairie requires a nuanced perspective Get out there for first light and last light And stop Stop a lot Most people just drive through in the middle of the day and miss the experience The prairie preserve isn t like a national park laced with hiking trails and scenic viewpoints overlooking major landmarks It has a pair of hiking trails that form a mile figure eight loop and scattered turnouts beside miles of graded gravel roads It s possible to drive through tour the visitor center and drive back to Pawhuska in a couple of hours But I spend most of the next three days heeding Payne s advice Up early Out late Stop constantly On the preserve it s still possible to experience the kind of unimpeded views that greeted the pioneers rolling grassland that stretches to a sunset horizon Photograph by MATT PAYNE First light is amazing not for any particular dazzle on the horizon but for the soothing calm and quiet When I cut my engine I hear at times absolutely nothing Then maybe a few early birds Amazingly given that this is flyover country I never once hear an airplane above Sometimes I hear bison grunting coyotes howling wild turkeys rummaging Last light is a living elegy The prairie feels like a long gone relative come to life and in the fading light a strong sense of nostalgia comes over me There was a time when this quality of peace this quiet abundance was the norm Now it s a glaring exception It s easy to feel sad for what we ve lost But then maybe a white tailed deer bounds through a field of Maximilian sunflowers or a Swainson s hawk soars by I feel settled And grateful to have this opportunity It is after all why I ve come back here Between prairie excursions I poke around Pawhuska The Osage Nation Museum has a fascinating exhibit of traditional wedding outfits Across town in the Osage County Historical Society Museum one exhibit informs me that from to more wealth from oil was produced from the Osage Hills than from all the American gold rushes combined In the decade between its first discovery well and its statehood in Oklahoma became the world s largest oil producing body Pawhuska was once the site of the first Rolls Royce dealership west of the Mississippi Little town on the prairie Pawhuska pop has seen a revival and tourist boom thanks to the popularity of cooking show celebrity Ree The Pioneer Woman Drummond Photograph by SHANE BEVEL I stop in at the Osage Nation headquarters to meet Chief Geoffrey Standing Bear He tells me about the Osage s recent purchase from Ted Turner of the acre Bluestem Ranch a cattle spread west of town that will be wholly owned and operated by the Osage Land is critical to our effort to rebuild our nation Standing Bear says We ve halted the loss of our land Now it s up to future generations to do what they can with it Though he envisions an eventual bison preserve this will be a working cattle ranch and not open to the public Harvey Payne rejoins me for my final day on the prairie We re headed for the hiking loop but first detour to pay homage to John Joseph Mathews the Osage writer who s been called the Thoreau of the Plains His Waldenesque book Talking to the Moon recounts a decade spent living in a tiny sandstone cabin on a patch of prairie surrounded by blackjack oaks The Nature Conservancy acquired the Mathews property a few years ago and offers guided tours of the cabin The place is suitably simple and supremely tranquil Inside its most striking feature is a huge stone fireplace which Payne promises me is the only one in Osage County with a Latin inscription painted onto the front of the mantel It reads Venari Lavari Ludere Ridere Occast Vivere to hunt to bathe to play to laugh that is to live A photo on the mantel shows Mathews pipe in hand sitting beside the fireplace looking well utterly at home The writer who died in at the age of is buried just outside his grave marked by a modest stone We ve saved the hiking loop for last The trail starts in a remarkable stand of big bluestem at least eight feet tall The way is marked by a mown strip we re walking entirely on cropped grass then circles through deep woods beside Sand Creek Controlled burning helps the prairie rejuvenate creating a mosaic of diversity patches of tender new shoots which bison love patches thick with accumulated thatch and patches with multiple plant species Photograph by HARVEY PAYNE I m not a particularly knowledgeable birder but I m an appreciative one and there s a lot going on Amid a chattering of red bellied woodpeckers is a lovely song by a Carolina wren coming from the oak canopy On the longer portion of the figure eight Prairie Earth Trail we cross Sand Creek to behold a sight straight out of a Gary Larson cartoon seven vultures perched on an old corral rail and six more on a dead tree trunk Then suddenly a great horned owl swoops right in front of us aiming for the creek and four of the vultures follow suit Must be something tasty down there As we leave the creek and woods and ascend a hillside we reach a different world Trees small grasses tall a sure sign of fire managed terrain We sit for a while on a bench and Payne recalls a Yogi Berra saying You can observe a lot just by watching Some of the big bluestem silhouetted against a gauzy sky are fully feet tall Payne notices my gawking and adds a slightly mind blowing tidbit The root systems of prairie grasses extend the same distance as or more than the height of the plant I think about that as we reach the apex of the trail and the views over the hills to the west seem to extend forever The sky appears infinite The tallest grasses in the world wave in the breeze yet half their growth is underground Life runs deep on the prairie This story originally appeared in the June July issue of National Geographic Traveler Robert Earle Howells is a California based writer whose passion is
