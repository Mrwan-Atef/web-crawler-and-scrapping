Beyond the barbecue Memphis s plant based take on classic southern cuisine Plant based eateries are shaking up Memphis s meat heavy food scene Photograph by Getty Images TRAVEL Beyond the barbecue Memphis s plant based take on classic southern cuisine Barbecue may be king in the Tennessee city but meat is only half of the story Inspired by regional produce and the city s love of soul food creative chefs are putting new plant based spins on classic Southern fare By Jacqui Agate September min read This article was adapted from National Geographic Traveller UK At Plant Based Heat owner Ralph RJ Groove Johnson is chuckling over a spitting fryer Twenty plus years ago I owned a branch of Crumpy s Hot Wings he tells me And now my first vegan restaurant is next door to one so we laughed about that One of more than wing joints here in the hot wing capital of the Deep South an epithet I ve heard three times in as many days Crumpy s is something of an institution The rib sticking finger licking wings it s been slinging since the early Nineties served up red hot or sweet with honey are as Memphis as Elvis Presley barbecue and the blues Here at Plant Based Heat however things are done rather differently The all vegan restaurant opened in June and is one of several plant based spots shaking up Bluff City s meat heavy food scene The vegan wings known as vings are a top seller made from a mix of soy and pea protein shaped into flats and drumsticks and then fried in rapeseed oil Then we sauce it up and you ll be back tomorrow says RJ with another belly laugh Diners eat zucchini noodles at Raw Girls Photograph by Justin Burks I get my wings with agave gold sauce a riff on Memphis s signature honey gold They re sticky and sweet with a low slow heat and turn my fingertips yellow Food is a passion in Memphis says RJ Folks like Mr Crump of Crumpy s just know how to cook It s in their blood And if your food s not good the people will tell you Memphis is a tough crowd Happily RJ s offerings have been crowd pleasers from the get go Having first trialled his recipes at pop ups around town it was soon clear that Memphians had an appetite for plant based food My favourite piece of equipment is my chargrill he says It just gives you that immediate smoke flavour That heady smoke and spice is distinctively Memphis and the mushrooms jackfruit and cauliflower on RJ s menu are vehicles for those Southern flavours For born and bred Memphian RJ though it s about more than just great tasting food I wanted to bring healthier food options to my community he says It s a sentiment shared by The Vegan Table a collective of four Black female vegan business owners Ayesha Collier of Sun of a Vegan Daishu McGriff of Shroomlicious Meals Donnesha McKinney of Thicc Ass Vegan and Francesca Kinsey of LiveYaLife Juices According to the women the pandemic inspired Memphians and particularly communities of colour here in this majority Black city to search for healthier plant based food options The Big Smack with sides at Imagine Photograph by Justin Burks We meet in Fourth Bluff Park in earshot of the buzz of Beale Street In the distance the M shaped Hernando de Soto Bridge rises over the Mississippi The last time I was here was for the festival says Donnesha And I couldn t tell you what this park actually looked like because people were just everywhere The event in question is Memphis s first ever plant based festival the Vegan Festival which debuted in June last year On a sizzling summer afternoon vendors packed out this little park hawking vegan versions of birria tacos mac and cheese and shrimp and grits Memphians came out in force and the proof was in the plant based pudding the city is partial to a meat free feast Such was the festival s success that it returned in alongside a Vegan Block Party in spring Memphis is so big on soul food says Ayesha Collier who s gearing up to open a bricks and mortar restaurant at Memphis s Hickory Ridge Mall I wanted to bring Memphians something they d love and that s comfort food Alongside their own ventures the four women collaborate with pop ups across town And today they ve cooked up a feast just for me There s a mighty meaty smashed mushroom patty wedged between hunks of Texas toast from Shroomlicious while The Sun of a Vegan lasagne is heavy with almond ricotta and herby marinara sauce I m offered a supremely sweet red velvet chezecake cookie from Thicc Ass Vegan and a zingy Green Glow juice from Live Ya Life Juices It s Memphis like I ve never tasted it before South Main a vibrant entertainment district Photograph by Justin Burks This is a barbecue city says Daishu but Memphis s food scene is pushing beyond what s expected It s exciting to see what we can do Indeed Across the city all vegan spots are springing up like mushrooms while well loved omnivore joints are adding meat free dishes to their menus But one place has been on the scene for over a decade Imagine Vegan Cafe is in Midtown in the trendy Cooper Young neighbourhood It shares a street with a veteran record store and a comic book shop and it was the only fully plant based restaurant in the city when Kristie and Adam Jeffrey opened it in The list of patrons is impressive big names including Stevie Wonder Chrissie Hynde and Bill Clinton have wandered through the doors to be greeted as I was by a painting of John Lennon gazing into the middle distance The late Beatle s ode to peace inspired the restaurant s name The extensive menu is centered on Southern comfort food A highlight is the huge barbecue sandwich the meat a wheat and soy based protein coated in sweet barbecue sauce and piled into a pillowy bun I order it with a side of nutty mac and cheese and baked beans punchy with smoke It s the South on a plate It s exciting to see creative restaurants breaking open the city s dining scene and placing vegetables at the fore Another trailblazer is Dory Memphis s first tasting menu only restaurant It s in Brookhaven Circle an area known for its stellar dining options and is owned and run by Tampa born chef Dave Krog and his wife Amanda a fourth generation Memphian They describe their venture as a farm driven ingredient driven intentionally sourced restaurant and they offer bespoke plant based tasting menus Historic Beale Street known as the Home of the Blues Photograph by Justin Burks We want to support local farms have beautiful menus and drive imagination in the kitchen Amanda says Indeed their near zero waste policy forces Dave and his sous chef Brandon Burke to be creative They pulp powderise dehydrate and ferment everything from beetroot to surplus satsumas It s opened up this incredible world of spice for us and it s all created from ingredients like carrot tops says Dave It s all vegan too Punchy fermented beetroot powder features in my amuse bouche a delicate concoction of pea shoots parsley oil and fig puree After that it s shaved and roasted golden beets with a salty peanut gremolata and more of that magic beetroot powder Everything is made from scratch with a pulled right from the earth freshness If Brandon had his way we d ship in seawater and make our own salt jokes Amanda Earthy mushroom grits are served next before a round of citrussy sorbet There are flashes of the South in the penultimate course baked squash finished with carrot barbecue a fermented tomato paste and dehydrated sprout leaves that vanish on the tongue I close with a tart apple jelly topped by three orbs of satsuma sorbet and ribbons of candied citrus peel The Memphis food scene is different from when I got here in says Dave Every year there are new concepts in this space One thing s for sure whatever bright minds enter Memphis s dining scene next plants will be firmly on the menu Chef de tournant John Johnson puts the finishing touches to the ratatouille at Dory Photograph by Justin Burks Where to eat in Memphis Raw Girls

Burgers Few things scream American comfort food more than a burger plant based patties are chargrilled for extra smoke and layered with vegan cheese Southern sides Vegan versions of cornbread mac and cheese hush puppies and baked beans are moreish additions to a meal Fried chicken and waffles Oyster mushrooms are a popular substitute for chicken in this traditional Southern dish Published in the
