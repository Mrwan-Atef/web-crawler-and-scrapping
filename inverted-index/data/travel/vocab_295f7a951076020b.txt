beaches around Dubrovnik s Old Town for a cooling dip Â xbrchx Getty Images Sun soaked Dubrovnik has culture in spades â stupendous medieval walls beautifully preserved monasteries and palaces and a whole slew of museums and galleries However it also has plenty of beaches most of them quite small both close to the Old Town itself and in the surrounding area Some of these are very well known and extremely popular others a little more remote and well hidden Whether youâ re after a refreshing dip or a place to lounge by the waterâ s edge with a cocktail read on and discover some of the best beaches in and around Dubrovnik If you really want to beat the crowds you could also join a kayak tour and paddle off to one of the swimming spots less easily accessible on foot or on wheels such as the rocky coast of the nearby Elafiti Islands You can swim or sunbathe with views of the Old Town of Dubrovnik Â Goran Jakus Shutterstock Banje Beach Best for families Advertisement Just a hop and a skip from the harbor this popular pebble beach has stunning views of the Old Town and plenty of facilities including restaurants and sun loungers This is Dubrovnikâ s main city beach so itâ s also enormously popular â meaning itâ s best to get here early before it fills up Itâ s good for families and in the evening transforms into a lively beach bar and party spot How to get there Just walk along from the PloÄ e Gate past Lazareti Sveti Jakov Beach Best local beach A little way past Banje but still less than a minute walk from the Old Town this local favorite is set below cliffs and is accessed by a flight of steps leading down from the Sveti Jakov Church The alluring stretch of shingle and pebble beach has sun loungers for rent and thereâ s a restaurant bar and toilets Like Banje it also has stunning views of the Old Town How to get there If you donâ t feel like walking you can take the or bus from the Old Town Kopakabana Copacabana Beach is long stretch of pebble beach with clear blue sea Â Shutterstock Kiev Victor Copacabana Beach Best for activities Advertisement Located on the northern shore of the Babin kuk peninsula at Seka Bay the chic Copacabana is rather smaller than its Brazilian namesake â but is still a good spot for a swim sunbathing and enjoying that requisite cocktail Youâ ll find a small armada of white sun loungers and cabanas and a gentle arc of pebble beach â and thereâ s a restaurant and bar You can keep busy here by renting jet skis here getting a massage and renting sports equipment How to get there Take bus or from Pile Best for swimming These rocks below the city walls accessed by a doorway off ulica od Margarite are something of an iconic spot for swimming and sunbathing or sipping a drink or two though theyâ re not quite the relatively hidden gem they once were There are a few small tables with sun umbrellas served by a small bar and a few concreted areas where you can try to fit a towel or just jump off into the sea The rocks at are not sheltered so itâ s not the best choice for kids How to get there You can only access by passing through the hole in the town s walls Å uliÄ i Bay This little pebble beach is right next to the Pile Gate sandwiched between the Lovrijenac and Bokar fortresses Nevertheless itâ s less busy than Banje and is quite sheltered and the water is just as clean There are no facilities on the beach but youâ ll find cafes and restaurants not much further than a swung towel away How to get there Just make your way to Pile Gate and slip on in Lopud is a great option for families with the shallow sandy Å unj Beach Â TPopova Getty Images Å unj Beach Best for sand Å unj is a sandy beach â one of the very few in the Dubrovnik area â on the island of Lopud one of the Elafiti Islands The water is quite shallow making it a fantastic place for families Youâ ll find sun loungers for hire and thereâ s a restaurant set in the woods just behind the beach How to get there You can walk across the island to the beach from the small town of Lopud where the ferry arrives â itâ s about minutes on foot or you can take a ride in one of the taxis read golf carts which ply the route Jadrolinija runs ferries to Lopud from Dubrovnik several times a day Lokrum Best for naturists The little island of Lokrum just a minute boat ride from the Old Town has a rocky shoreline which makes for some lovely swimming spots Thereâ s also a shallow saltwater lake in the centre of the island if you want something a little less rugged and rocky â the high salt content has earned it the nickname of the Dead Sea Lake The southern part of the island is a naturist beach How to get there Lokrum can be reached by ferry or private boat PasjaÄ a Beach is regarded as one of the most beautiful beaches in Europe Â Shutterstock Simun Ascic PasjaÄ a Beach Best for peace and quiet For something a bit more wild and isolated try this â PasjaÄ a is a narrow pebble beach which comes with a stunning setting at the base of a sheer cliff and is accessed by a longish path which tunnels through the rock in places and steps The beach is actually man made having been created in the though youâ d never guess it PasjaÄ a lies out past Cavtat and Dubrovnik airport a good from Dubrovnik near the village of PopoviÄ i â but is well worth the effort of getting there and has become increasingly popular in recent years There are no facilities on the beach so take water and food with you and carry all litter back to the car park How to get there There s no public transport to PasjaÄ a so you d have to take a car or taxi Veliki Around northwest of Dubrovnik facing the island of Å ipan Veliki is a beautiful stretch of stones and pebbles backed by a narrow band of greenery just below the Jadranska magistrala the main coastal highway Itâ s a good choice for families and is a little less busy than the beaches close to Dubrovnik itself Thereâ s a small bar and restaurant and a few water sports on offer How to get there Take bus or from Dubrovnik Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Croatia Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers
