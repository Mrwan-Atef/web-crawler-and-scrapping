saunas and intense cold polar bear style plunges or ice baths Contrast bathing is particularly prevalent during the winter in northern climates think saunas in Finland or banya in Russia Though it might sound slightly uncomfortable subjecting yourself to extreme temperature shifts has physical and psychological benefits It gives you a kind of jolt that can increase a feeling of well being says

analysis found subjects who immersed themselves in water between and degrees Fahrenheit found it to be a highly effective tool for muscle recovery following high intensity exercise That s because warm water dilates blood vessels and cold water constricts them increasing blood flow and oxygenation to tissues and speeding healing From a health benefit there are many reasons to do it says Fredericson

The Spa at the Inns of Aurora in New York s Finger Lakes region But cultures in Europe and Asia have been doing it for hundreds of years perhaps even longer Nordic countries such as Sweden and Finland are particularly hot on contrast bathing Saunas and sweat baths have existed since the time when humans settled in one place says Laura Seesmeri a cultural heritage researcher at the University of Turku in Finland About years ago saunas in Northern Europe began as wood fire heated pits covered with animal skins They evolved into warming huts and by the mid century electric stoves sometimes replaced smoldering embers as heat sources In Finland the sauna is so intrinsic to daily life that UNESCO added it to its list of intangible cultural practices in The country with a population of around million has about million private and public saunas They show up in national folklore century Finnish poem the Kalevala depicts Nordic gods basking in the steam saunatonttu sauna spirits are reputed to guard saunas and instruct users on their proper use The sauna is considered to be the time between the everyday and the sacred says Seesmeri Many Finns kick off their weekends with a sauna

bathing cultures from hammams in Turkey known for their heated marble slabs to South Korean jjimjilbangs The latter may have roots in the century when Buddhist priests ministered to groups of parishioners in fire heated domed clay rooms resembling outsized kilns During purification rituals people reclined on mats soaked in water which helped produce steam Indoor bathing culture developed in the early century partially due to the country s occupation by the Japanese who imported elements of their onsens As Korea grew wealthier and more modern people could afford private bathrooms at home By the jjimjilbangs had morphed from places to keep clean to places to keep up with friends and family Guests soak in an outdoor hot pool overlooking Haeundae Beach at Paradise Hotel in Busan
