Jamie Ditaranto Mar min read Share Dodge the crowds and respect the locals with our key things to know before visiting Barcelona Getty Images Barcelona is an incredibly popular destination with good reason â its wealth of stunning architecture incredible food scene charming neighborhoods and a thriving nightlife is enough to rival any major city But that popularity can also bring complications the city s overtourism problem and local resentment makes itself known through aggressive graffiti near popular attractions The Barcelona City Council even restricted some of the access to viewpoints in response to mass tourism Advertisement Still it s entirely possible to visit Barcelona without adding to these problems with some planning and insider info In my years of living in Barcelona Iâ ve learned how to avoid shoulder to shoulder crowds and enjoy the city as a local would Hereâ s everything you should know before you come to Barcelona from the essential safety tips to the cultural landscape You canâ t see everything in a day Barcelona may not be the biggest city youâ ve ever visited but it is massive when you consider all the ways you can entertain yourself Because there is so much to see the ideal number of days for a trip to Barcelona is between two and five That should be enough to cover the must sees but if you want to explore more in the surrounding area days would give you additional time to plan day trips either to nearby cava wineries the Costa Brava or even as far north as the Pyrenees for a day of skiing Consider visiting places like Casa on a separate day than another big tourism locale on your list Alones Shutterstock There will be lots of tourists Avoid the crowds by traveling during the off season or trying to get an early start on the day before the cruise ships pull in and the streets fill up with visitors You can also book many tickets in advance to avoid long queues but in some places you wonâ t be able to avoid the crowds Try to space out the big attractions in your itinerary so you have some breathing room in between for example donâ t go from the Sagrada Familia to Casa Avoid visiting during major events if you re on a budget Barcelona draws big acts from around the world every summer as a mainstay on the music festival circuit But unless youâ ve got your ticket to Primavera Sound or Sonar already you may want to avoid traveling during these weekends or any other time when large trade fairs like the Mobile World Congress take over the city Itâ s already an expensive destination but accommodation rates skyrocket when a big influx of visitors is on its way Advertisement Plan your visit for one of Barcelona s many festivals like the Taronjada at Carnival Iakov Filimonov Shutterstock Know what cultural events to look for If you want to have an authentic cultural experience in Barcelona you can look for local events that embrace Catalan traditions like the parades of giants human tower gatherings Sardana dance circles and the Correfoc fire parades You may stumble across them if youâ re traveling over a holiday like Semana Santa Holy Week but if you want to secure your odds make a trip in September when the city celebrates La MercÃ one of Barcelonaâ s patron Saints with a week of festivities that include cultural events and free concerts If walking La Rambla feels too crowded consider another place to stroll in the city Valeri Luzina Shutterstock Thereâ s more than one Rambla Everyone will tell you La Rambla is a must do but for me walking La Rambla feels a lot like walking through Times Square â crowded touristy and to be avoided whenever possible Thankfully the city has more than one Rambla where you can actually enjoy the slow strolling these city features were built for In the center you can venture down the Rambla del Raval with its famous Botero cat sculpture or go a little bit out of the way to walk the Rambla del Poblenou from Diagonal all the way down to the beach The Barcelona beaches can get crowded nito Shutterstock The beaches get better the further out you go Barceloneta is the most famous beach in Barcelona and the adjacent neighborhood is worth checking out for its narrow streets and great tapas spots but travel further down the coast if you actually want to lay out on the beach Barceloneta can get very crowded and noisy with tourists so walk or cab your way past Port OlÃ mpic to Platja de la Mar Bella Because all the beaches in Barcelona are artificial built for the Olympic games the sand isnâ t the nicest If you can travel outside the city to Sitges or up the Costa Brava youâ ll find more tranquil and scenic beaches Apartments at La Rambla del Poblenou Getty Images Get to know Catalan culture An autonomous region of Spain the subject of Catalan independence is still touch and go but you should be respectful to the locals by learning about all the distinct characteristics that give Catalans their cultural identity Show a little curiosity and locals will be more than happy to tell you all about their favorite traditions from wintertime onion barbecues to the cheeky caganer the pooper a beloved Christmas icon Catalan is not a dialect of Spanish If youâ re looking for the quickest way to offend a Catalan this is the one Almost everyone in Barcelona can speak Catalan and Spanish and the tourism circuit is well set up for English speaking clientele so you should have no problem getting around However you can make a good impression on your hosts by learning a few words Some are similar to Spanish and French like â Holaâ and â Merciâ for â Helloâ andâ Thank you â but you can also try â Bon dÃ aâ for â Good morningâ and â AdÃ uâ for â Goodbye â Watch your items while out and about MarcoPachiega Shutterstock Pickpockets are a real issue Just about everyone in Barcelona has a first or second hand pickpocketing story including me they slipped two credit cards out of my wallet while I was working on my laptop in a crowded cafe You should never let your guard down especially when riding the metro or walking down crowded tourist areas like La Rambla Put your phone away whenever youâ re not using it and never leave it sitting on the table if youâ re dining outside Public transportation is safe and efficient Although you do have to mind your belongings from the nefarious pickpockets one of the best things about living in Barcelona is how easy and efficient public transportation is Iâ ve had generally positive experiences and itâ s easy to connect to the major train and bus stations for adventures outside the city You may also see the red shared bikes called Bicing but they re only available for rent to residents If you want to take advantage of Barcelonaâ s bike lanes youâ ll have to get a rental from a shop Be strategic about how and where you lock it â bike thieves are as common as pickpockets Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Spain Let a local expert
