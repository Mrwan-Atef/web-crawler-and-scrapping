just look for the line of people At the time of writing it could only be admired through an arched viewing door though plans are afoot to build a viewing platform circling the chamber to help ease congestion Elaborate zellige geometric tilework and gilded honeycomb muqarnas abound in this hall which gets its name from the fact that its cupola ceiling is supported by three groups of four pillars of marble Two of these columns are noticeably older plundered loot from the ancient Roman city of Volubilis This chamber the most luxurious part of the tomb is the final resting place of Al Mansour and his sons The walls of the Saadian Tombs are covered with elaborate tilework Jose Ignacio Soto Shutterstock Chamber of Three Niches and Prayer Room Surrounding the central Chamber of Pillars are
