days in advance of travel Costs vary depending on your nationality and the duration of the visa so check the e Visa portal for the latest information All e Visas take at least hours to process so be

introduction from Indian companies and organizations that they plan to meet Assuming you meet the requirements business visas are usually valid for a year and allow multiple entries with a stay of up to days on each visit Working for an Indian company is more complicated Youâ ll need an employment visa and a work permit â in most cases this means you need a firm job offer and assistance from an Indian employer to complete the paperwork As with all visa requirements the situation is subject to change contact your local Indian embassy or consulate for the most up to date information Applying for a tourist e Visa is fairly straightforward To apply for an Indian e Visa visit the governmentâ s official e Visa portal Youâ ll need to upload a digital passport style photo and copies of your passport ID pages and pay the visa fee which varies depending on your nationality and the duration of the visa Your passport must be valid for six months beyond the date of entry and youâ ll need two spare pages for the visa which will be physically stamped into your passport on arrival Assuming your application is accepted which is the case for most applicants youâ ll receive a digital Electronic Travel Authorization ETA which you should print out and carry with you when you travel so you can present it to the immigration authorities on arrival Note that in some cases airlines may ask you to confirm your visa online when you check in so make sure you have your mobile phone or laptop to hand and can get online at the airport Obtain a visa ahead to enter India overland from Nepal Bangladesh or Pakistan Soumyajit Nandy Shutterstock Where can I enter India with an e Visa E Visas allow entry to India through designated airports at Ahmedabad Amritsar Bagdogra Bengaluru Bhubaneshwar Kozhikode

travel to enter India overland If you plan to enter India overland â for example from Nepal Bangladesh or Pakistan â youâ ll need a visa stamped into your passport before you arrive which youâ ll need to obtain from the Indian embassy or consulate in your home country or through an approved visa application office If you plan to visit India and Nepal on the same trip get a multiple entry visa â it used to be possible to arrange a new Indian tourist visa through the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu but the authorities may now insist on a two month gap before issuing a new visa Thereâ s no need to worry about applying for a visa for Nepal in advance â theyâ re available on arrival at border crossings bring passport photos and US dollars to pay the fee If you can t apply for an e Visa get one in person in advance Contact your local embassy or consulate to check the application process in your country the Indian Ministry of External Affairs maintains a list of diplomatic missions online Itâ s best to apply for a visa in your home country â obtaining an Indian visa from an embassy in another country can be tortuously slow assuming itâ s permitted at all Fees and the permitted duration of stay will vary depending on your nationality As an alternative to applying through an Indian embassy or consulate you may be able to apply for a visa through a visa agency â however this tends to be more expensive than applying directly In practice many of these agencies just collect together applications and then send over a staff member to the embassy to apply in person People enrolled in full

Visas cannot be extended but other types of visas can though only in exceptional circumstances such as a medical emergency or the theft of your passport To apply youâ ll need to use the governmentâ s special online portal providing evidence of a valid reason for extending your stay in India such as a letter from the hospital where you are being treated or a police report You may then be called in for an in person interview at the Foreignersâ Regional Registration Office FRRO in Delhi If there is a fee it will be made clear during the application process Some border areas in India require additional travel permits Under a system carried over from British colonial rule special permits known as â protected area permitsâ or â restricted area permitsâ are required to visit many areas close to Indiaâ s disputed external borders with China Pakistan and other territories â a zone known as the â inner line â This includes several states in India s less explored Northeast Applying for these permits outside India is tricky but you can usually apply locally in India without too much difficulty Permits are especially important for highly sensitive border areas where some places may be off limits to all travelers or only open to Indian citizens Applications can be made through local government offices or local travel agencies contact the state government offices for these regions to get the latest information In some areas you may need to register with the local Foreigners Regional Registration Office on arrival but this is an easy process Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
