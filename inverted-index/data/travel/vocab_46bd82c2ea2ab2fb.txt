hammocks are comfortable year round Â anyaberkut Getty Images With awe inspiring scenery dense layers of culture plenty of sun surf and sand and balmy temperatures year round Bali calls out like a beacon to adventurers sun seekers and travelers who like to truly immerse themselves in the countries they visit Whatever your travel tastes you ll find rewarding things to see and do in Bali at any time of year The dry season from April to September is the most enjoyable time of the year for outdoor activities including basking on beaches hiking surfing sailing diving and canyoning Visit during the wet season November to March and you ll experience frequent downpours but there s good surf on the east coast and you can still enjoy the outdoors especially in drier areas in the east and north of the island Temperatures in Bali donâ t vary much from season to season hovering between C and C F to F year round though it s often cooler in mountain areas Whatever you re searching for letâ s help you determine the best time to visit Bali Advertisement The high season may be busier but it s the best time for outdoor activities Â Knmata Shutterstock The high season Julyâ August and December is the best time for festivals and partying Baliâ s July August dry season overlaps with European and North American summer holiday breaks as well as extended breaks in July given to Australiaâ s and New Zealandâ s students The increase in long distance travelers makes it one of the busiest times of the year If youâ re looking to avoid crowds or expensive flights this isnâ t the best time to visit That said there are plenty of reasons why people come to Bali during this time of year The high season in Bali coincides with the traditional summer vacation season in Europe America and Australia in July and August It s the height of the dry season and the peak time for surfing on the west coast at the breaks around Canggu and Seminyak Bali s original beach hub Kuta can be mobbed at this time of year as many travelers come here specifically for the party season Most parts of Bali are inundated with visitors in summer as tourists come to sample the islandâ s many delights and enjoy some of its most colorful festivals Indonesia celebrates its independence from colonial powers on August with plenty of pomp and fanfare Expect entertaining parades and street parties in the bigger towns The period around Christmas and New Year also sees a large influx of travelers seeking a reprieve from cold northern winters Many hotels restaurants and other venues organize special dinners and entertainment to mark the festive season New Yearâ s Eve is particularly memorable with spectacular fireworks at midnight to help you rock in the new year in style Key events to look out for are the Pemuteran Bay Festival Penglipuran Village Festival and of course New Yearâ s Eve celebrations High season means high prices and pressing hordes in tightly packed tourist areas For a quieter experience look to more remote places like Nusa Penida and Pemuteran Surfing season is in full swing during the shoulder season Â Getty Images The shoulder season Aprilâ June and Septemberâ October is best for adventurous travelers The shoulder season in Bali falls at either end of the dry season when the weather is either improving after the rains or getting slowly wetter after the dry months Things are quieter without the summertime crowds and the weather is normally still dry enough for outdoor activities However the two week Easter spring break can get very busy in tourist areas such as Kuta and Legian Advertisement May marks the surfing season in full swing on the west and south coasts and rafting trekking and spelunking beckon adventure sports fans As rain showers in October are more frequent than in the dry summer months plan to spend some time indoors visiting temples museums and cultural institutions in Ubud Denpasar and other centers for Balinese culture Top international events in October include the Ubud Village Jazz Festival and the Ubud Writers and Readers Festival Bali is lush and green in the months following the rainy season Â Pete Seaward Lonely Planet The low season Januaryâ March and November is best for budget travelers Baliâ s low season coincides with its rainy season and this can be an unpredictable time for outdoor activities The rain tends to scare most crowds back home and the island has a more relaxed vibe But if youâ re hoping to catch good waves there s still decent surf on the east coast at legendary locations such as Padang Padang and the weather is still warm Of course this makes the low season the best time to visit Bali for the lowest prices Rainfall can get heavy at times but Baliâ s tropical rain usually doesnâ t last all day And though thereâ s always the risk of tropical cyclones reaching the island Baliâ s close enough to the equator to keep most fully formed cyclones away As long as you donâ t mind occasional rainfall and smaller crowds the low season can be a good season to enjoy calmer vibes in Bali Even during low season Bali keeps busy with community festivals and activities At the end of January or the start of February Chinese New Year celebrations feature typical Balinese elements such as traditional percussion bands and dancers dressed as the mythological lion like creature Barong The festival of Nyepi the Balinese New Year moves with the lunar calendar but frequently falls in March This is a culturally fascinating time to visit Bali but after the colorful parades of ogoh ogoh puppets the night before the festival the Day of Silence itself can be a tricky time for visitors as everything closes transport ceases and nobody is allowed out on the streets Understanding the Balinese calendar Note that religious festivals such as Galungan and Kuningan are scheduled according to the Balinese day pawukon calendar This means they happen roughly every seven months according to the Western calendar Dates for village festivals are not always set in stone either and the timing of the Nyepi festival is dictated by the lunar saka calendar meaning the date changes every year If youâ re planning a trip around a festival or event check the precise dates before you book your flights More on when to visit Bali How long should I visit Bali With that said you might feel extra rushed if you try to squeeze it all into a three day weekend trip In order to actually enjoy your trip and give yourself time to check all the essentials off your list you probably need days A week should provide enough time for you to see and do everything you want Of course you can extend your trip longer to see and do even more But if you need enough time to plan a beach day check out the terraced rice fields at Jatiluwih explore the incredible waterfalls at Banyu Wana Amertha get spiritual at the Pura Besakih temple and see everything else you consider essential a week should do the trick What month should I visit Bali To know the best month for you to visit Bali prioritize what you want to do For lunar new year celebrations plan a February trip for Chinese New Year or a March trip for Nyepi For more arts and cultural events consider an October trip And for the more hedonistic parties you might have heard about youâ ll probably want to visit during the peak season months of July and August Then thereâ s the matter of outdoor activities For surfing low season might work depending on where you go but you really want to come during peak season for the most consistent waves island wide For walking and hiking during the most pleasantly dry weather you probably also want a trip during the peak season But if you donâ t mind the occasional showers and you prefer fewer crowds outside the April June and September October shoulder seasons should work fine When is the cheapest time to visit Bali For the best bargains aim for the January March low season Though the islandâ s wet season spans from October all the way to March December has become a second high season due to the rush of tourists during Christmas and New Yearâ s For the best chance of scoring the cheapest rates you probably want to look at the January March low season By this time the holiday travelers are gone and prices usually hit rock bottom Of course these are also Baliâ s rainiest months But as you can see above these rainy months come with their own special charm as you enjoy the relative peace and quiet Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order
