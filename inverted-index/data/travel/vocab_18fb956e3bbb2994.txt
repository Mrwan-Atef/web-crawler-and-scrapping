Jungle shrouded Yaxchilán has a wonderfully atmospheric setting above a horseshoe loop in the Río Usumacinta The control this location gave it over river commerce and a series of successful alliances and conquests made Yaxchilán one of the most important Classic Maya cities in the Usumacinta region Archaeologically Yaxchilán is famed for its ornamented facades and roofcombs and its impressive stone lintels carved with conquest and ceremonial scenes A flashlight is helpful for exploring some parts of the site Yaxchilán peaked in power and splendor between AD and under the rulers Itzamnaaj B alam II Shield Jaguar II Pájaro Jaguar IV Bird Jaguar IV and Itzamnaaj B alam III Shield Jaguar III The city was abandoned around AD Inscriptions here tell more about its Jaguar dynasty than is known of almost any other Maya ruling clan The shield and jaguar symbol appears on many Yaxchilán buildings and steles Pájaro Jaguar IV s hieroglyph is a small jungle cat with feathers on its back and a bird superimposed on its head As you walk toward the ruins a signed path to the right leads up to the Pequeña Acrópolis a group of ruins on a small hilltop you can visit this later Staying on the main path you soon reach the mazelike passages of El Laberinto Edificio built between AD and during the interregnum between Itzamnaaj B alam II and Pájaro Jaguar IV Dozens of bats shelter under the

was originally found in front of Edificio The bigger of the two figures visible on it is Pájaro Jaguar IV An imposing stairway climbs from Stele to Edificio the best preserved temple at Yaxchilán with about half of its roofcomb intact The final step in front of the building is carved with ball game scenes and splendid relief carvings embellish the undersides of the lintels Inside is a statue of Pájaro Jaguar IV minus his head which he lost to treasure seeking century timber cutters From the clearing behind Edificio a path leads into the trees About along this fork left uphill go left at
