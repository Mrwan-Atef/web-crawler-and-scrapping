Ancient walking trails are back and you can hike them TRAVEL Our ancestors walked these trails hundreds of years ago Now you can too From prehistoric paths dating back to the Neolithic period to walking routes used by Buddhist monks and tea merchants these trails offer much more than a scenic walk in nature Twenty five years ago National Geographic Explorer Mei Zhang met Tibetan native and mountain guide Aluo seen above while hiking across Biluo Snow Mountain Her trek inspired WildChina s first trip from Sewalongba to Diwa Zhacha Photograph by WildChina By Jen Rose Smith April Mei Zhang grew up amid the emerald cloaked mountains of Yunnan China where an old joke mentions that the gorges were so narrow and their slopes so steep that you could shout across the valleys to ask your nearest neighbors to dinner The punchline in a region where walking paths were the only links between some rural homes is that it would still take them all day to arrive The mountains and the trails shaped the way people lived recalls Zhang a National Geographic Explorer and founder of the travel company WildChina They defined Zhang s childhood even as the landscape fired her yearning to see the world When you looked out in front of you it was mountains after mountains And you didn t know what was beyond she says Many of the trails that Zhang walked as a child fell into disrepair as modernizing China sprouted cities railroads and highways at a breakneck pace But today some are newly accessible to travelers who can explore in the footsteps of those who forged them In part that s thanks to Zhang s work to revitalize one of the oldest and most iconic paths in Yunnan the year old Tea Horse Road Once a trade route joining lush Yunnan tea forests with markets in highland Tibet it was gradually abandoned and at times lost entirely Reimagining the path as a hiking route Zhang hopes the Tea Horse Trail will help sustain the mountain culture she grew up with and bring economic gains to little visited rural areas They offer this feeling of connection to the land connection to tradition connection to heritage Zhang says I m like there s got to be a way to keep these going The question of how to do that is the subject of her dissertation at the University of California Berkeley where Zhang is a Ph D candidate studying the Tea Horse Trail this spring she s returning to Yunnan to walk and conduct research along it Related Rediscovering China s ancient Tea Horse Road a branch of the famous Silk Roa d Where to hike an ancient footpath Her work goes beyond academia too The Tea Horse Trail is a cornerstone of WildChina s GUDAO Project which aims to restore the Tea Horse Trail and other largely forgotten paths across China Gudao means ancient trails in Chinese In February of this year WildChina launched a series of new walking tours along those trails from an overnight trek through the West Mountains outside Beijing to a day Biluo Snow Mountain trip in the

is a personal passion for Zhang it also comes at a time when historic walking trails are making a comeback around the globe backdropped by landscapes as varied as the cultures calling them home In the dense forests of northern Sweden and Norway the mile Finnskogleden follows paths taken by century Finnish immigrants many of the trail s sections are accessible as day hikes and you can walk the entire trail in around two weeks Amid the rock formations and desert peaks of southern Jordan the newly opened mile Wadi Rum Trail knits together old trade routes and Haj pilgrimage paths In keeping with ancient Bedouin traditions most hikers explore the trail alongside guides from local tribes In the United Kingdom the Slow Ways project aims to map and promote walking routes between every British town and city including along prehistoric paths dating to the Neolithic period visitors can use an online route planner to find nearby trails or plot multi day adventures The mile Trans Bhutan Trail which opened in follows century Buddhist pilgrimage routes winding from village to village across the mountain kingdom The nonprofit that founded the trail offers guided hikes including two annual departures that tackle the entire distance an epic day trek Related Why ancient pilgrimages are back in vogue in the UK From slow travel to slow living Hiking such trails offers more than a scenic walk in nature says Daniel Svensson an associate professor at Sweden s Malm√∂ University who has studied the Finnskogleden and other heritage paths There are these longer perspectives on history that you can find on these trails he says They are connected to a way of life where slow mobility was more common That way of life is within living memory in Yunnan and other places where the trails have reemerged Construction on Bhutan s first road began only in notes Sam Blyth founder of the Bhutan Canada Foundation which led the initiative to restore the Trans Bhutan Trail Before the second half of the century walking paths were the only way to get from place to place in the country When hiking the Trans Bhutan Trail Blyth says he met elders who recall how as the old trails and bridges lapsed villages were severed from their nearest neighbors divided by a steep slope or rushing river They lost touch with people who had been part of their lives and communities for decades Blyth says By rebuilding bridges and paths the Trans Bhutan Trail helped restore such ties while also delivering income sources to far flung places They re fixing up rooms in their house for travelers they re opening cafes and small restaurants says Blyth noting that a walking trail can more directly help local people than big resorts and hotels We wanted to see real grassroots benefits Related Discovering misty peaks and monasteries on the newly restored Trans Bhutan Trail Living traditions on the trail For nomadic Bedouin communities in Jordan and Egypt meanwhile guiding visitors on the ancient trails draws on skills passed down between generations from navigation to desert survival says Olivia Mason a lecturer in geography at Newcastle University who has studied the geopolitics of walking trails The trails can be really important because they work with livelihoods that are mobile in some ways and actually continue to promote that says Mason contrasting the culturally relevant meaningful work of guiding walkers with more typical tourism jobs such as working in a gift shop While doing research among Bedouin communities near trails in Jordan Mason has noticed that for some families guiding work has the potential to keep young people in rural places offsetting a trend to seek jobs in urban areas When I speak to the children of the trail guides the children say I want to be a guide like my father she says That living history is vital because trails are heritage unlike any other If left untended trails swiftly vanish whether swallowed by evergreen forests or buried in desert sands or wrapped in a spongy carpet of moss It s only in the walking that trails survive for generations to come says Daniel Svensson the Swedish trails researcher In that light travelers on ancient trails aren t just seeking out history they re actively participating in its preservation You can t take a trail and put it in a museum it s something you need to continue to use Svensson says It s a physical manifestation of history Related Discover the real Transylvania on a new long distance hiking trail Jen Rose Smith is a Vermont based writer covering adventure sustainability and
