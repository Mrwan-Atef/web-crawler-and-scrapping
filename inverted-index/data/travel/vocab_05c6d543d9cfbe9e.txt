Fundy National Park Hiking through Fundy National Park Photograph by Nancy Lindsay My Shot TRAVEL Fundy National Park min read Location New Brunswick Date Established Size acres Time and tides wait for no man the saying goes And it s most true at Fundy National Park on New Brunswick s east coast where twice daily the most dramatic tides in the world cover the ocean bed with up to feet of water the equivalent of a four story building Over the next six hours the water sluices back to reveal the sea bottom mucky covered with seaweed and bursting with intertidal wildlife Park Facts Wonder Contender One of Canada s smallest national parks and New Brunswick s first the park encompasses about eight miles of famous Fundy shoreline along Chignecto Bay as well as a large slice of the maritime Acadian Highlands natural region of Canada This rich natural system of forests once threatened by human development is now recovering nicely the only human activity here these days is the quiet footfall of hikers traveling its varied network of coastal forest and waterfall destination trails The park s Bay of Fundy is now a finalist for one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World Tree Time The Acadian forest here blends two types of tree populations the more northern evergreen boreal forests of spruce and fir common in northern New Brunswick and the maple yellow birch larch aspen beech and balsam hardwood forests typical of the more southeasterly Great Lakes St Lawrence region This forest much of it festooned with dangling old man s beard lichen is growing in place of earlier logged out softwoods A century ago logging came close to destroying vast swatches of woodland Today the park is home to the world s oldest red spruce tree at years old How to Get There Nearby airports include Moncton St John and Fredericton New Brunswick with Moncton the closest to the park and Fredericton the farthest away All three airports have car rentals available Bus terminals

Stanley Thompson a heated saltwater swimming pool just off Point Wolfe Road summer hiking camping and shore exploration as well as winter cross country skiing hiking and snowshoeing It s also liberally peppered with iconic Canadian imagery for photographers lucky enough to catch sunlight instead of frequent morning fogs which usually burn off by mid afternoon in summer Text adapted from
