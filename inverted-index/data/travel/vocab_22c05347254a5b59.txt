friendly tropical even idyllic But first and foremost itâ s very very chill Shutterstock If youâ re visiting Barbados for the first time expect to slow down This is not the place for hustle and bustle In Barbados life is lived at a laid back and leisurely pace Itâ s a place where you might spend so long lounging on the beach sipping on rum punches that you might end up missing your dinner reservations And you wonâ t even mind That doesnâ t mean there isnâ t plenty to do here We like to say that Barbados has a place for every kind of traveler â foodies history buffs and nature lovers alike You can come to the island and learn to surf or free dive or spend your days at some of the finest golf courses in the Caribbean Or get a bit tipsy as you sip on the some of worldâ s best rum Advertisement Indeed there s a lot to do here â but you mustnâ t try to rush as you pack it all in For while Barbados is many things â romantic friendly tropical even idyllic â itâ s first and foremost very very chill Thereâ s never a bad season for chilling out in Barbados Kyle Babb for Lonely Planet When should I go to Barbados There isnâ t necessarily any one â bestâ time to visit Barbados a tropical destination thatâ s pretty much sunny year round with very little temperature variation with an average daytime high of C F June to December is the rainy season when the weather tends to be wetter and the chance of a hurricane hitting the island increases This doesnâ t mean itâ s a bad time to visit though travel between April and November the long low season can be more affordable From December through March expect significantly higher flight prices and accommodation costs as the country welcomes the most visitors of the year Consider planning your trip around seasonal events From late July to early August you can experience the exciting and vibrant Crop Over festival while the tasty Barbados Food and Rum festival takes place every year in late October Running enthusiasts might want to plan their trip around the first weekend in December for Run Barbados the Caribbeanâ s biggest marathon weekend If youâ re a lover of motor sports late May and early June in Barbados is known as Rally season How much time should I spend in Barbados I always recommend five days as the perfect amount of time If you jet in for just two days or a weekend youâ re sure to leave wishing you spent more time here This is due to our slower less structured pace of life That again Maybe that restaurant that youâ re dying to try is only open Wednesday through Sunday with limited hours Or perhaps you planned to pack in a bunch of different activities in one day but you end up only making it to one becauseâ you fell asleep on the beach Or the bus you planned to catch was minutes late It happens You can count on public buses and private â ZRsâ to get you around the more densely populated areas of Barbados Frank Fell Media Shutterstock Is it easy to get in and around Barbados Nonstop flights serve Barbados from many major cities including New York Miami Boston Atlanta Toronto and even London Grantley Adams International Airport is about minutes from the capital city of Bridgetown Advertisement A taxi from the airport to your accommodation is your best option you wonâ t have trouble finding one once you arrive About that accommodation where you stay is an important consideration when it comes to getting around the island The islandâ s public transportation system consists of public buses and private â route taxisâ known affectionately as â ZRsâ pronounced â zed arsâ that can get you around easily But some areas are more accessible than others For instance the islandâ s south coast popular with tourists is relatively accessible to many attractions with the bus routes and transportation options to match Yet if you opt to stay on the more rustic east coast you should rent a car as public transportation is more limited Top things to do in Barbados A Friday night fish dinner at Oistins Bay Garden is a Barbados rite of passage Kyle Babb for Lonely Planet Hit up Oistins on a Friday night No trip to Barbados is complete without a stop at Oistins Bay Garden an open air fish fry that comes alive on Friday nights with music karaoke and other entertainment Barbados is known for its deliciously seasoned fresh fish and Oistins in the heart of the islandâ s primary fishing village is one of the best places to sample this local specialty Sip on delicious local rum Since Barbados is considered the birthplace of rum itâ s been distilled here since the century you shouldnâ t visit the island without taking a rum tour Youâ ll learn the ins and outs of rum distillation and the spiritâ s long relationship with the island while sampling some of the finest rums in the world Some tours include a cocktail making class during which youâ ll learn the secrets to Barbadosâ signature rum punch â which will surely be a hit at your next dinner party Snorkeling with sea turtles is always a thrill Kat Harrison Getty Images Snorkel with the turtles in Carlisle Bay A catamaran cruise along the idyllic coast of the island is a must do activity in and of itself And snorkeling with sea turtles takes the experience to the next level Thereâ s something incomparable about witnessing the grandeur and majesty of sea turtles in warm crystal clear water I simply cannot recommend this enough Create your own island tour via Mini Moke Rentals of Mini Moke electric vehicles are an extremely affordable and popular option for tourists looking for a self planned day long excursion With your own wheels you can hit popular tourist attractions like Codrington College the lion at Gun Hill Signal Station and Animal Flower Cave This is a great way to experience Barbados on your own terms while enjoying the sun on your face and the sweet island breeze in your hair Pack a lunch grab some friends and hit the road Sunsets on Barbabosâ west coast never dispppoint Kyle Babb for Lonely Planet My favorite thing to do in Barbados I know it sounds basic Yet sitting beachside sipping a refreshing cocktail rum sours are my drink of choice and watching the sun set on the islandâ s west coast never gets old for me Itâ s picture perfect postcard magic Between the sun leaving pink and purple streaks across the sky and the waters brushing against the shore itâ s truly a beautiful way to end your day And start your night How much money do I need for Barbados Barbadosâ prices lie on the higher end of the spectrum Yet as with any destination there are plenty of ways you can lower the cost of your trip â such as taking advantage of specials booking early and eating at budget friendly spots Note that prices spike in the high season December to March especially for accommodation Most establishments accept cards but be sure to have cash if you want to purchase items from street vendors US dollars are widely accepted Basic
