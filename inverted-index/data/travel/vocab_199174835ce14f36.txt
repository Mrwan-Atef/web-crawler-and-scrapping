the order of the day here and where else can you get all that and a dramatically situated Maya site Stay in lush digs and dine in stylish restaurants with stunning views There are also plenty of activities around to keep you busy if you can pry yourself out of your rented lounge chair for the afternoon Staying near the beach brings heftier prices but there are budget friendly hotels near the

deserted sands of Playa Salchi Ferrantraite Getty Images Playa Salchi Best beach for diving and sealife Oaxacaâ s beautiful Pacific coast is home to several varied relaxed beach destinations and a near empty shoreline strung with long golden sands and lagoons full of wildlife Playa Salchi halfway between the western edge of Parque Nacional Huatulco and Puerto Ã ngel is one of the most precious destinations in Oaxaca The water can be somewhat rough on the main beach but there are several swimmable beaches nearby The nearby town of Huatulco was developed in the late with a more ecological bent than some of the bigger resorts in Mexico More than dive sites and hectares acres of coral reefs in the surrounding waters make this the ideal low key destination for all things below the surface Dolphins turtles and humpback whales all cruise through this coastline For the best tours head to Huatulco Salvaje a group of certified local tour guides Many of them are from families that were displaced after the creation of Parque Nacional Huatulco in the and they know their stuff when it comes to nature tours Beach huts clustered along the edge of Yelapa Karamysh Shutterstock Yelapa Best beach for LGBTIQ travelers Puerto Vallarta fell out of favor for a while as CancÃºn rose to prominence but this enticing coastal destination is stretched around the sparkling blue BahÃ a de Banderas and backed by lush palm covered mountains Itâ s also known for its thriving nightlife and numerous LGBTIQ friendly options and has become the gay beach capital of Mexico The best beach near Puerto Vallarta is Yelapa Itâ s the furthest of the southern beaches from town tucked into a secluded and beloved bay Itâ s home to a small community that frequently fishes off the pier Though it can get busy with day trippers Yelapa empties out in the afternoon and has several comfortable places to stay if you prefer quiet evenings A surf shop next to the beach in Sayulita Roaming Pictures Shutterstock Playa Las Islitas Best beach for sleepy days on the sand Riviera Nayarit is all the rage with families these days and itâ s really no wonder Punta Mita and Sayulita are both charming little surf towns with clear aquamarine water white sand great food and tons of wildlife excursions into the stunning jungled mountains But head to the peaceful drowsy backwater of San Blas for a dose of perfect laid back charm The beaches here â Playa Los Cocos Playa Miramar and our favorite Playa Las Islitas â are popular for surfing and have palapas under which you can lounge and drink fresh coconut water Playa Las Islitas is wonderfully swimmable with very gentle surf just perfect for beginners Advertisement If youâ re searching for waves though head to Troncones where the world class surfing has been attracting ex pats for a few years now Thereâ s also good mountain biking in the hills and day trips to check out petroglyphs in a nearby cave and a local hot spring to soak sore surfer muscles Snorkeling next to a school of blue tang fish in the crystal clear waters off Cozumel James R D Scott Getty Images El Cielo Best beach for snorkeling Cozumel remains Mexicoâ s number one stop for diving and snorkeling The surrounding reefs are world renowned and for good reason The jaw droppingly impressive variety of marine life is visible year round and includes spotted eagle rays moray eels groupers barracudas turtles sharks brain coral and some huge sponges The beach at El Cielo living up to its heavenly name has shallow turquoise waters that are ideal for snorkeling and swimming among starfish stingrays and other small bright fish Itâ s only reachable by boat and tour operators are readily available for the half mile journey from Cozumel Book a trip with Aldora

sharks September and October offer the best weather conditions for diving A jetty jutting out into the clear waters of Laguna Bacalar Shutterstock Laguna Bacalar Best beach for quiet paradise More than miles long with a bottom of sparkling white sand the crystal clear Laguna Bacalar offers opportunities for camping swimming kayaking and simply lazing around amid a color palette of blues greens and shimmering whites â as if youâ ve left real life behind and stepped into a picture perfect fantasy The small and sleepy town has enough going on to give you things to do and places to eat but letâ s be honest itâ s the quiet opportunity to soak in all the beauty that is the draw here To live out your cabana over turquoise water dreams head to Rancho Encantado A day at this striking hotel consists of waking up having breakfast on the lagoon kayaking or swimming in calm translucent waters and then unwinding in the jacuzzi Playa Los Algodones Best beach for perfect white sand Near the under the radar beach retreat of San Carlos in the state of Sonora Playa Los Algodones is arguably the most beautiful beach in northern Mexico The sand is fine and white the water blue and calm and the view is of dramatic mountains Low key San Carlos is presided over by the majestic twin peaks of Cerro Tetakawi which glow an impressive red earthed hue as the sun descends Kayaking is the main activity other than beach lounging but there are hikes up the mountains and horseback riding in the desert Northern Mexico isnâ t often traveled by visitors holding passports from outside of Mexico but it can get packed with weekend warriors from nearby Hermosillo Even so Sonora sees far fewer travelers especially foreigners than its myriad attractions and drop dead beauty would suggest A solo woman walking along Playa Zipolite at sunset Andy Sotiriou Getty Images Playa Zipolite Best beach for ditching your swimwear The beach at Zipolite is huge stretching for a good miles and dispatching massive waves Itâ s famous for nudity so youâ ll see people randomly swimming sunbathing or happily walking across the wet sand minus their clothes at any time of day It is more common in a couple of coves at the western end of the beach and in the small bay called Playa del Amor The town of Zipolite is a chilled out strip of palapas beach shacks and intentionally rustic boutique hotels It s the largest of the three beach towns that decorate the coast west of Puerto Ã ngel and itâ s well known for surfing an unashamed do nothing vibe and a touch of bohemian magic The essence and glory of Zipolite is that organized activity is minimal This is a place for hanging out and doing as little as you like But you will need to eat so head to the outstanding La Providencia a contemporary Mexican treat with a perfect open air lounge Playa Carrizalillo surrounded by lush vegetation Piero Zanetti Getty Images Puerto Escondido Best beach for surfing Ahhh Puerto Escondido Is this where surfers go when they die Many places claim to be the worldâ s best surfing beach but Puerto Escondidoâ s Playa Zicatela â miles of golden sand and crashing waves â makes many wave riderâ s top for good reason The heart of the action is the Mexico Pipeline at the northern end But if youâ re looking to learn among the best head to Playa Carrizalillo This small beautiful sheltered cove west of the center is a superstar of Mexicoâ s beaches and a gorgeous place to hang out swim and live vicariously as a surfer dude In fact it is the place to go for beginner surfers Book a lesson and youâ ll probably end up here making a splash or three There is a mellow line of palapa beach bars when you finish Around town youâ ll find that the Rinconada Quarter is emerging as a culinary hot spot and the beach bars in Zicatela host spirited dance parties for late night mischief Playa del Caballo Best beach for privacy Playa del Caballo is adjacent to Playa las Ã nimas a popular tourist beach getaway for the locals of Puerto Vallarta that is accessible by water taxi The teeming shores of Playa las Ã nimas are lined with rows of beach chairs and crowded bars But a short walk to the north on a path that winds behind a few small bungalows brings you to Playa del Caballo A true paradise with electric blue water and towering palm trees this beach is like your own private discovery where the bevy of crabs that scuttle up to shore make up most of your fellow travelers Families sunbathing and swimming on Playa Delfines in CancÃºn Francisco J Ramos Gallego Shutterstock Playa Delfines Best beach for families with kids Ask any local about the best beach in CancÃºn and youâ re sure to hear about Playa Delfines Running south of the Zona Hotelera across the street from the city s most important ancient archaeological site El Rey Playa Delfines is one of the few beaches in CancÃºn not dominated by an imposing resort You wonâ t be alone here as itâ s hugely popular but thereâ s plenty of powdery sand for everyone to spread out This sweeping beach is one of the rare surfing spots in CancÃºn so bring your board or simply play in the waves Plenty of parking public restrooms lifeguards rows of thatch roofed palapas that are free to use and even a playground make this an ideal spot for families Enjoy the churros and mango on a stick sold by the vendors Playa Mujeres Best beach for clear waters Visitors to the CancÃºn area have discovered the previously little known Playa Mujeres to the north of the Zona Hotelera Home to several adults only resorts and the Playa Mujeres Golf Club this beach appeals to a mature well heeled crowd looking to unwind Still it remains relatively quiet and unvisited You wonâ t find thumping beach clubs or imposing mega resorts here â just elegant boutique hotels and miles of pristine sand Visitors walking along the clear white sands of Playa Norte on Isla Mujeres Eddy Galeotti Shutterstock Playa Norte Best beach for a desert island vibe Ten miles off the coast of CancÃºn Playa Norte is located on Isla Mujeres famous for having the largest concentration of whale sharks on the planet Playa Norte is significantly quieter than its noisy neighbor and both locals and tourists use golf carts bikes and scooters to move around the beach and the island Once you reach Playa Norte you wonâ t want to leave Melaque Best beach for a laidback local feel
