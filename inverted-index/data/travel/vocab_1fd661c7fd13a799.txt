Park Tanzania Africa Top choice in Northern Tanzania Login Save Since its official opening in Mt Kilimanjaro National Park has become one of Tanzania s most visited parks Unlike the other northern

park is the Mt Kilimanjaro Africa s highest mountain and one of the continent s most magnificent sights Kilimanjaro is also one of the world s highest volcanoes and it s the highest free standing mountain on earth rising from cultivated farmland on the lower levels through lush rainforest to alpine meadows and finally across a lunar landscape to the twin summits of Kibo and Mawenzi Kilimanjaro s third volcanic cone Shira is on the mountain s western side The lower rainforest is home to many animals including buffaloes elephants leopards and monkeys and elands are occasionally seen in the saddle area between Kibo and Mawenzi A hike up Kili lures around trekkers each year in part because it s possible to walk to the summit without ropes or technical climbing experience Non technical however does not mean easy The climb is a serious and expensive undertaking and only worth doing with the right preparation There are also many opportunities to explore the mountain s lower slopes and
