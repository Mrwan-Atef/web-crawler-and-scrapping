include seasonal camping and rock climbing as well as year round zip lining on vast wooded campuses Rock climbing at nearby Summerville Lake and other local spots has exploded in recent years adding

recreation at the expense of developing other industries Tourism isn t recession proof she says And overinvesting carries its own risks Case in point Athens Ohio s plans for an mile million bike park
