Napa beyond the vineyards innovative local restaurants and gutsy craft beer Get a sense of what s on locals everyday menus hot dogs topped with sauerkraut oozy gouda paninis at Oxbow Public Market the food hall in Napa city Photograph by Ryan Lahiff TRAVEL Napa beyond the vineyards innovative local restaurants and gutsy craft beer It may be synonymous with vineyards and bold Cabernet Sauvignon but dig deeper and you ll find experimental menus rich in local produce and a gutsy craft beer movement that prove there s more to the region than grapes By Alicia Miller May min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK On the sidewalks of St Helena just over an hour north of San Francisco it feels hot enough to fry an egg on the pavement It s around on the manicured high street of the wine town the heat radiating across the clipped rows of the surrounding vineyards So naturally I blame thirst for driving me into a cool tasting room at just Not that I should have to explain myself this is Napa Valley where drinking is encouraged Surrounded by steel tanks and barrels effervescent assistant Zack spends an hour pouring me samples Then a dozen boozy splashes in when things have gone pleasantly fuzzy and the outdoor heat has faded to distant memory he pulls out one final bottle This he says filling my glass is really special it has notes of mandarin and lemongrass I breathe in the zesty aromas and sip deep Now that s one heck of a beer Yes beer in Napa Valley America s most famous wine region Here where most worship at the altar of the grape specifically bold tannic Cabernet Sauvignon it takes imagination to do something different More than that with both tourism and local economics skewed heavily towards wine it also takes guts Nile Zacherle founder of Mad Fritz Beer definitely has that While training in brewing decades ago he found the increasingly generic ingredients used in mass market beers uninspiring so switched to winemaking Later as the craft beer movement grew he saw a gap in the market for a quality Napa variety and started Mad Fritz alongside his vinous day job Imagine all wineries got their grapes from exactly the same place Nile explains to me That s pretty much what commodity brewing is But we wanted authenticity of origin behind our ingredients In other words Nile wanted to make his beers like wine sourcing grain carefully he grows some himself malting in house barrel ageing in French oak and bottle conditioning His brews range in style from the citrussy white ale I am sipping to botanical infused gruit and contain bases like spelt or heirloom blue corn His piece de resistance Napa Ale is a reflection of time and place using Oak Knoll District barley and local hops Obviously I think to myself polishing off my beer and heading back into the St Helena sunshine this valley can grow more than grapes Ashes Diamonds Winery just outside Napa city turns heads with effortlessly cool wines Photograph by Ashes Diamonds At Mad Fritz brewery craft beers range from citrussy white ales to botanical infused gruit Photograph by Jeff Bramwell Napa hasn t always been about wine Before the landmark Judgment of Paris in when Californian vintages triumphed over French in a blind panel tasting depicted in the film Bottle Shock this sun drenched corner was a hippie agricultural backwater But in years it s become one of the world s most prestigious wine regions with its Cabernet Sauvignon dominated reds fetching triple digit prices Multimillion dollar wineries now line thoroughfare St Helena Highway sometimes charging up to per head for a tasting Chic wine towns like Yountville or Calistoga are punctuated with five star hotels Despite appearances though as Mad Fritz proves there s more to this mile long valley than wine tourism Even as consumer demand has pushed up the vineyard acreage some businesses still do things differently Farmers like Peter Jacobsen in Yountville use the land to grow organic figs pears and rare tomato varieties In his case for some of California s top restaurants including Thomas Keller s three Michelin starred The French Laundry One of Jacobsen s other clients is Philip Tessier chef at stalwart steakhouse PRESS in St Helena He joined in and has since transformed it into a Napa produce focused fine dining restaurant When I took over it was all steak with Cabernet Sauvignon he tells me in the restaurant kitchen later that evening after the sun has set and the day s heat is on the wane But that s a one dimensional programme There s diversity and experimentation in the valley and a tasting menu gives us the opportunity to showcase things people don t consider when they think about Napa The valley s unique growing seasons drive the menu As I head towards my table for dinner Phil says We get tomatoes all the way through to October and squash seven months of the year The only challenge is deciding what to choose At a table on the terrace I work through dishes with verdant pea bright sweetcorn and basil His signature dish squash blossom wrapped ricotta gnudi with parmesan consomme is rich yet delicate By the time I get to the white asparagus served with American wagyu ribeye cap in an elevated homage to the restaurant s steakhouse roots I feel like I ve devoured a field s worth of fresh produce Accompany a handful of must try tipples with a feast that beats the bland charcuterie boards at Ashes Diamonds Winery Photograph by Ashes Diamonds Next day I head to Napa city the valley s largest settlement to get a sense of what s on locals everyday menus In contrast to the rural ritzy tourist towns of St Helena Yountville and Calistoga Napa feels real with busier streets bars and affordable restaurants And a fabulous food hall the Oxbow Public Market Inside I m caught up in the lunchtime rush Hot dogs topped with red onion sauerkraut and relish are taken out onto the sun splashed terrace for devouring Oozy gouda and chicken paninis are smothered in jalapeño aioli All around stalls are brimming with sweet smelling stone fruit and shelves are stacked with olive oils chocolates and spices I m tempted by some oysters not from Napa but harvested just miles away but I hold myself back I ve got other dining plans It s mid afternoon when I finally arrive at Buster s Southern BBQ a minute drive up the valley in Calistoga Open since this unassuming spot lacks pretence dishing up lunchtime beef ribs pulled pork and hot links from a kiosk window As I polish off my coleslaw in the shady outdoor dining area the trendy hot spring spas of the town s high street and its grand tasting rooms feel pretty distant Buster s Southern BBQ up the valley in Calistoga is an unassuming spot for lunchtime beef ribs and live music Photograph by Barbara Jolly and Arely Martinez It s even hotter than yesterday That s no surprise Calistoga is among the sultriest of Napa pockets set in an arid corridor that feels like the Kalahari this afternoon So when I enter Tank Garage Winery set inside a petrol station across the street from Buster s the lights are off The town s power supply has been temporarily cut to save everyone s full blast air con from overwhelming the electricity board Thankfully it s cool in here In more ways than one with old gas pumps and vintage signage Tank isn t your typical Napa winery Gazing at the tasting list I can see that s different too littered with grapes like Barbera Trousseau Gris and Mourvèdre There s a sparkling skin fermented Pet Nat and even a carbonic maceration white Around of California is planted with the usual suspects Cabernet Chardonnay Pinot Noir South Africa born winemaker Bertus van Zyl tells me But there s that is oddball and super interesting I love wines that are stylistically higher in acid more old world in style In short Tank wines aren t your traditional hefty Napa reds As I taste my way through the quirky range I learn every wine is a one off even if grapes are sourced from the same vineyards each year they ll never be blended or vinified in the same way twice Innovation is the aim so long as it s delicious anything goes The La Loba white with Petit Manseng and Bianchetta Trevigiana is a particular favourite of mine But the grapes don t come from Napa Bertus sources them from El Dorado County while the fruit for his other wines largely comes from nearby regions like Sonoma and Mendocino Napa s high land prices mean you can t justify growing such niche grapes here it simply doesn t make financial sense As the lights come back on another challenge apparent during my two sweltering days here is explained to me the reason the power is cut on hot days is because it reduces the risk of overloading the grid and in turn fires Napa has already known too many of those in devastating blazes burned through its Meadowood resort We re dealing with forest fires but also frost record breaking rain and flooding as well says Bertus Along with the other producers in Napa he s at the frontline reacting to these effects and recognises the need to think ahead Could there be any better argument for diversification in the valley Relying on Cabernet Sauvignon means there s no Plan B Innovation by people like Bertus whether through hardier grape varieties or new growing locations can provide options to face the uncertain future The best thing we can have in the long run he says as I take my last sip of his unique wine is creativity A taste of Napa Ashes Diamonds Winery The design of this winery just outside Napa city turns heads a minimalist white washed block with a window lined tasting room The wines are effortlessly cool too lower in alcohol than many other valley wines relatively restrained and beautifully balanced Come for a pairing experience and you ll get a handful of must try tipples alongside a feast that beats the bland charcuterie boards of some other spots Expect wedge salad with herbed tahini and crispy quinoa or tender chicken with chickpeas marinated peppers and chorizo for a wine and food pairing lunch with four wines and five dishes Bear This chic yet unfussy restaurant at the new Stanly Ranch hotel is the perfect example of Napa city s growing gourmet food scene Grab a seat on the terrace at sunset and dive into Californian ingredients given a globe trotting dressing up think honeynut squash with bee pollen and guajillo chilli It s delicious and surprising in equal measure for three courses excluding wine Inglenook At Francis Ford Coppola s rambling wine estate tastings are a real experience Enter the opulent French inspired château and it feels like you ve stepped onto a film set with Persian rugs lounge music and moody lighting but then would you expect less from the man behind The Godfather The Cabernet Sauvignons are superb but don t miss the white Rhône style blend Blancaneaux with Viognier Roussanne and Marsanne Look out for the subtle art hung in the interior painted by Coppola himself Heritage Tasting How to do it America As You Like It has a seven night Northern California Wine Country and Coast itinerary from per person including flights car hire and room only
