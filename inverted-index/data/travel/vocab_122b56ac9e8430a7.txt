Visit the Italian filming locations seen in Ripley White Lotus and more TRAVEL Why Hollywood is obsessed with Italy With its romantic cities evocative landscapes and sparkling seas Italy has long been a screen location favorite from Ripley to White Lotus Here s how to beat the set jetting crowds when it comes to its most popular locations Cinque Terre provides a more authentic Italian experience says film historian Nicola Bassano Photograph by Matteo Colombo Getty Images By Julia Buckley April This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Rome Venice Capri the list of locations for the new Netflix series Ripley reads like the recipe for a bucket list trip through the best of Italy Patricia Highsmith was inspired to write The Talented Mr Ripley the book on which the series is based during a holiday on the Amalfi Coast and the new series looks set to inspire countless replica trips throughout Italy Of course Italy has long been a star of the screen Its ravishing landscapes trapped in time cities and rich traditions make it a perfect fit for anything from Hollywood blockbusters to food documentaries Italian landscapes have always been a unique attraction for international filmmakers says film historian Nicola Bassano Some of these locations have entered the imagination of millions of viewers around the world The thing about Italy s most beautiful bits however is that they tend to be full of other people who ve been drawn to follow in the steps of the White Lotus cast Sophia Loren or Tom Ripley himself What s more as Bassano notes most foreign films about Italy represent our country in a distorted way something between the comic and the grotesque He puts it down to the influence of Federico Fellini s Rome classic La Dolce Vita which gave viewers who didn t always realise it was a satire an exaggerated view of the country Here s how to see the most famous bits without becoming mere extras in the crowd and how to glean authenticity in even the most overtouristed locations Rome From Roman Holiday to La Grande Bellezza the Italian capital has long been a hit on the silver screen It has always been a symbol of beauty mystery and Italian style dolce vita says Bassano The beauty of Rome has been well captured on the silver screen Photograph by Ian Dagnall Alamy In Gladiator it was the all powerful centre of an empire In Bicycle Thieves and other Neorealist films it was an impoverished postwar shell of a city Roman Holiday centred it as a tourist destination and La Dolce Vita cemented it in all our heads as the sensual capital where anything goes Following in Hollywood s footsteps can take you back in time In Gladiator the Colosseum took centre stage as Maximus Decimus Meridius played by Russell Crowe took his final revenge in a bloody battle Gladiatorial combat may not have been a thing since CE when it was abolished across the Roman Empire but even years on you can still get an idea of what went on with an underground tour of the Colosseum running since While most of the tourists stay upstairs you ll plunge into the bowels of the building through passageways where gladiators walked past niches where wild animals were held and lift shafts through which they were catapulted up into the arena to fight to the death in front of up to spectators Nearly years since the Colosseum was at its peak it s still an astonishingly visceral experience The Spanish Steps not only featured in a pivotal scene of Roman Holiday in which Audrey Hepburn enjoyed a gelato with Gregory Peck but also in The Talented Mr Ripley the Hollywood adaptation of Highsmith s novel which starred Matt Damon Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow Today they re always packed with tourists and eating yes even a gelato is strictly banned Instead sink into that vintage mood with a seat next door at Babington s Tea Rooms which has been serving tea and cakes since Or get a prime view of the steps from the Keats Shelley House a bijou museum dedicated to Italy s influence on the Romantic poets Venice Forget its reputation as the city of love from Andrew Scott gliding down the Grand Canal on a vaporetto water bus in Ripley to Donald Sutherland s fight to the death in Don t Look Now Venice has always been a top spot for thrillers Although it s one of the best known cityscapes on the planet La Serenissima the most serene a traditional nickname for Venice has always kept its air of mystery its canals shifting with every change of the light and buildings disappearing as fog rolls in Start at Palazzo Grimani where the denouement of Don t Look Now was shot Back then in it was an abandoned mansion today a museum it s as eerie as ever with flaking year old frescoes in barely furnished rooms and unframed paintings by grand masters perched on easels as if they ve just been completed The Scuola Grande di San Rocco is fondly known as Venice s Sistine Chapel Photograph by Robert Harding Alamy The Scuola Grande della Misericordia which took centre stage in the Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp thriller The Tourist isn t usually open to visitors Instead head to the Scuola Grande di San Rocco decorated from floor to ceiling by artist Tintoretto and known as Venice s Sistine Chapel For extra movie points make for the Lido the city s long sandbar island with sugar soft beaches Dirk Bogarde breathed his last here in Death in Venice today the Venice Film Festival revolves around the swanky Excelsior hotel where you can grab a movie themed drink overlooking the Adriatic Cinque Terre For Bassano there s just one problem with seeing Italy on film foreign directors tend to view it through a saccharine slicked lens Continual references to food noisy neighbourhood markets full of people gesticulating the American vision of Italy is far from reality he says We get imprisoned in the same old stereotypes of the Bel Paese beautiful country a nickname used by Dante in the Divine Comedy as a place to eat pray and love For a more authentic experience he advises head to Cinque Terre the five famous cliff wedged fishing villages surrounded by a national park in Liguria Leonardo di Caprio floated around this coastline in Wolf of Wall Street but for Bassano the film that best typifies the area is Disney Pixar s movie Luca Director Enrico Casarosa is Ligurian and spent childhood summers here sees the reopening of the Via dell Amore the most famous of Cinque Terre s many footpaths Closed since a landslide in it winds around the cliff connecting picture perfect villages Riomaggiore and Manarola Access planned from July will be by guided tour only giving visitors background on Cinque Terre s history and still tight knit communities And while most visitors crowd out the villages head into the hills and you ll find around miles of panoramic footpaths crisscrossing the cliffsides Cinque Terre a group of famous Italian fishing villages was featured in Wolf of Wall Street starring Leonardo di Caprio Photograph by Eloi Omella You ll also want to swap the cliche spritz for a glass of local wine The villagers have spent the past years terracing and taming the sheer cliffs to produce mineral saline whites that bring Cinque Terre s vertiginous landscapes to life with every sip Try them on the clifftop at Riomaggiore s A Pié de Ma or with a slice of focaccia under fairy light lit lemon trees at romantic A Piè de Campu To subscribe to National Geographic Traveller UK magazine click here Available in select countries only Related Topics MOVIES FILMMAKERS CULTURAL TOURISM TRAVEL LUXURY
