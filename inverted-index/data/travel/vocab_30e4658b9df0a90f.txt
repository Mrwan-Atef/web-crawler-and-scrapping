neighborhood guide Benedetta Geddo Apr min read Share Venice s bustling Grand Canal Gilles Rivest Shutterstock While all six sestieri neighborhoods in Venice are undoubtedly Venetian each has its own distinct charms and flavor The city layout has remained more or less unchanged since the Romans arrived in the Lagoon to establish one of their castrum camps Venice has a famously confusing system when it comes to numbering its streets Each sestiere neighborhood has its own numbering Building numbers don t stop at the end of a street but continue throughout the entire sestiere You will consequently see houses with very high numbers And to make things more confusing when addresses are listed the building number is rarely included simply the street name the neighborhood name and the district number It adds to the sense of achievement when you finally find the place you are looking for â honest Hereâ s our guide to the best neighborhoods in Venice including where to stay play and explore Advertisement A gondola ride in San Marco Toni Palomares Shutterstock San Marco Best neighborhood for iconic Venetian scenes San Marco is where you can find the picture book Venice Named after the cityâ s patron Saint and the true heart of the city ever since its foundation San Marco has it all Want stunning world famous landmarks The Basilica and its Campanile as well as the Palazzo Ducale are just a short walk away Want to do some shopping before heading back home You can check out Calle Larga XXII Marzo the high end shopping street of Venice or head to the Fondaco dei Tedeschi once the palace warehouse of German merchants coming to the Lagoon and today one of the city centerâ s main shopping malls San Marco is the place to be if you like to be surrounded by centuries old buildings and luxury as well as people â itâ s the most famous area of an already famous city Itâ s also an excellent choice if you want to avoid public transport and use your legs as much as you can as all the major sights are within walking distance Where to stay is a classic hideaway with floor to ceiling silk draperies subtle rococo flourishes and the odd heirloom furniture piece Angle for a room overlooking the gondola stop Or try Gritti Palace a high end hotel set in a dogeâ s palace on the Grand Canal and lavished with rare marble Rubelli silk damask precious artworks and antiques The Grand canal and the Rialto Bridge Volkova Natalia Shutterstock San Polo Best neighborhood for straddling two worlds Just on the other side of the Canal Grande San Polo is close enough to San Marco to enjoy its polished palaces and chic vibes but itâ s also separate enough to feel like its own city within a city â perhaps because San Polo is the smallest of all the six sestieri You can have it both ways in San Polo â stay close to the Canal Grande and enjoy the landmarks on both sides of the water as well as above it like the Rialto Bridge or you can lose yourself in the alleyways and little calles streets off the main road discovering picturesque corners and authentic pieces of Venetian history San Polo will also welcome you with open arms if youâ re looking to live the gourmand life You canâ t miss the Rialto Market divided into fruits and vegetables and fresh seafood â stalls are there almost every morning Sundays excluded until around midday San Polo is also where you can get a good pre dinner aperitivo and then enjoy some post dinner nightlife Advertisement Where to stay Caâ Barba is hidden down a quiet lane just around the corner from Rialto Market and offers exceptional value Rooms are spacious with timber ceiling beams and huge smart TVs Or splash out at Oltre il Giardino the home of composer Gustav Mahler s widow Alma complete with a lush walled garden an elegant lounge and six tastefully appointed rooms hung with artwork The Peggy Guggenheim collection Shutterstock Dorsoduro and Giudecca Best neighborhood for searching for Veniceâ s hip side The southernmost of the sestieri Dorsoduro which includes the island of Giudecca has some of Veniceâ s most interesting museums and most populated universities Dorsoduro is home to the famous Caâ Foscari University widely known in Italy as being one of the best for the study of languages as well as the Venice Architecture Institute It goes without saying then that the area is a top choice for students and as a result the whole of Dorsoduro brims with eateries and nightlife Dorsoduro has reinvented itself as Veniceâ s own Soho Visit the Peggy Guggenheim Collection and Pinaultâ s Punta della Dogana and keep an eye out for the smaller galleries sprouting up in the neighborhood all the time The district has long been a favorite with foreign second home buyers meaning that Dorsoduro doesnâ t have the same Venetian feel as nearby San Polo However it has beautiful boutique hotels fine eateries and world renowned modern and contemporary art This is an excellent neighborhood for art lovers but itâ s also ideal for winter breaks as itâ s the sunniest part of the city Where to stay The guest room at Le Terese an century granary comes with Persian rugs vintage furniture and water views A beautifully renovated two bedroom apartment is also available here Pensione Accademia Villa Maravege is a peaceful century garden villa just off the Grand Canal with old school parquet floors antique desks kind staff and excellent breakfasts Bridge of Sighs Venice Italy alexeleny Shutterstock Castello Best neighborhood for immersing yourself in art While Dorsoduro can boast some incredible collections one might say that the true art hotspot of the city is Castello Facing right onto the Lagoon and with a quieter vibe than its packed neighbor San Marco Castello is the domain of the Venice Biennale From the Giardini della Biennale with their famous thirty pavilions each belonging to a different country that uses them to display their works of art every two years to the spaces within the Arsenale you can feel the mark left by the Biennale everywhere you walk in Castello But history hangs heavy here as well the Arsenale where specialized artisans crafted all kinds of ships is what made Venice a maritime powerhouse and helped it dominate the seas for more than a millennium To break from sightseeing rest for a bit at the Parco delle Rimembranze also known as the Santâ Elena pinewood right on the tip of the sestiere and looking out onto the Lido Where to stay B B San Marco where Alice and Marco offer a warm welcome to their floor apartment no lift overlooking the Scuola Dalmata Family antiques furnish the three guest rooms Or try Ai Tagliapietra a well located welcoming and unpretentious B B with three simple but smart rooms For something completely differemt stay in the century palace Palazzo Cristo It has four extravagant apartments kitted out with top quality fabrics and custom made modern pieces One has its own rooftop terrace Cannaregio at night Natalia Bratslavsky Shutterstock Cannaregio Best neighborhood for feeling like a local Cannaregio is the largest and most populous Venetian sestiere Itâ s pretty close to Veniceâ s train station Santa Lucia and so it bustles with activity commuters arriving from the mainland into Venice for their workday people going to and from the more central areas of the city Unlike San Marco though Cannaregioâ s vibe remains more local and informal Itâ s a great place to enjoy the more famous landmarks during the day but then retire to a quieter area well as quiet as Venice can be for the night This sestiere is also where the old Jewish quarter used to be and the Jewish community and their heritage are still a huge part of the neighborhood â from the two active synagogues to museums and several kosher eateries Where to stay Ponte Chiodo is a charming little B B with period furnishings canal views and a private front garden Itâ s also a short walk from superb neighborhood wine bars A similarly charming spot is Caâ Dogaressa a friendly family run inn on the Cannaregio Canal Rooms include bed crown canopies gilt mirrors Murano chandeliers and terrazzo flooring If you re traveling solo but want to meet others try Combo Venezia a modern upbeat hostel in a converted convent Slumber in dorms twins or apartments some with canal views and chill with the other guests in the beautiful old cloister Rio della Cazziola canal in Santa Croce RizziStefano Politi Markovina Shutterstock Santa Croce Best neighborhood for day tours Santa Croce is the only sestiere of Venice where cars and buses are allowed to move around before roads end and canals begin Itâ s where the Santa Lucia train station is located and the main entryway into the city for anyone who arrives using the bridge connecting Venice to the mainland Itâ s a great choice if you re also planning to leave the Lagoon for some day excursions to other parts of Veneto or maybe some of the beach locations both North and South of the city Santa Croce might not look quite as pretty as the other sestieri but there are plenty of things to keep you interested the Museo di Storia Naturale di Venezia within the old Fondaco dei Turchi the vibrant square of San Giacomo dellâ Orio and the Palazzo Mocenigo Veniceâ s museum of fashion history as well as possible haunting grounds of the ghost of philosopher and writer Giordano Bruno Where to stay Campiello Zen is a smart homely B B set in a family home with handsome antiques and terrazzo flooring Or try Cima Rosa a beautifully appointment B B passion project of an American interior designer and Italian architect Most rooms sport Grand Canal views Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Italy Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers
