at their heights Here are our favorite destinations around the world that will delight with their balmy year round temperatures no matter which hemisphere youâ re in Just remember to pack a lightweight jacket Coolcation ideas in the northern hemisphere If youâ re based north of the equator and are looking to travel in the same hemisphere youâ ll need to take stock of where summers are less oppressive Here are some of our favorite spots Filled with freshwater swimming spots and natural wonders Michiganâ s Upper Peninsula has a temperate climate even in the peak of summer Tim Bieber

Temperatures hover around the mid s mid s C during the warmest part of the year You may have to dodge a summer rain shower or two yet CDMX rewards you with world class museums and culinary treats Delve into pre Columbian history at the Museo Nacional de AntropologÃ a peruse exquisite Mexican folk at Museo de Arte Popular and top it all off with a food tour or a dinner splurge at an iconic CDMX restaurant like Quintonil or Contramar Iceland Itâ s right there in the name folks Icelandâ s short but sweet summer still has a chill in the air â but skips the snow ice wind and darkness of its winters revealing instead the glorious windswept volcanic landscapes that have been inspiring travelers for centuries The Golden Circle around ReykjavÃ k always proves a good starting point though we recommend leaving the crowds behind by heading north or east on the Ring Road Go whale watching in the Westfjords trek over glaciers and volcanos on the FimmvÃ rÃ uhÃ ls Trail or visit the City of the Elves in BorgarfjÃ rÃ ur Eystri Expect dazzling nature â without breaking a sweat Advertisement Finlandâ s countless lakes deliver summer pleasures without unpleasantly high temperatures nblx

those looking to escape the heat Depending on where you find yourself in these large nations temperatures will range from the mid s around C to the mid s low s C and you can count on extremely long days thanks to the countriesâ northerly latitudes Among thousands of options we love enjoying pleasant afternoons on patios in Stockholm taking to Norway â s majestic fjords and getting on the water in Finnish Lakeland Along Irelandâ s coasts you can enjoy sunshine intermittently and refreshing sea breezes Viktor Loki Shutterstock Ireland In summer Ireland delivers a romance thatâ s hard to beat whether youâ re wandering the emerald countryside or immersing yourself in one of its soulful cities Rain may come and go but temperatures stay mild and outdoor adventure beckons particularly along the coast head inland though and youâ ll likely be battling the midges Grab a set of wheels and hit the Wild Atlantic Way to see some of the countryâ s most gorgeous coastline â from County Cork in the south to Malin Head in the north This is Ireland at its most dramatic Coastal Pacific Northwest USA While Washington State and Oregon are well known for their rainy climates summer in the Pacific Northwest provides a reprieve from the precipitation delivering sun and mild temperatures that make exploring their majestic natural attractions a joy Between the two states youâ ve got four national parks to choose from Olympic Mt Rainier North Cascades and Crater Lake as well as thousands of acres of national forest â plus hundreds of miles of striking coastline straight out of a fantasy novel The regionâ s cities come alive with festivals and events in the summer too Do note however that the mercury can tick up in the high desert areas east of the Cascades â so be sure to hug the west if you arenâ t looking to break a sweat Sapporoâ s massive summer festival is a highlight of any warm weather visit to HokkaidÅ Vassamon Anansukkasem Shutterstock HokkaidÅ Japan One of the best places to ski in Japan when winter snow falls HokkaidÅ in the summer offers an oasis from the heat and humidity that sets in in points south Road trip through the gorgeous countryside hike among the peaks of

hemisphere destinations deliver on two counts Youâ ll be able to enjoy an actual winter thanks to inverted seasons or take advantage of balmy summer weather later on You can enjoy cool Andean air â and views of drifting condors â at the CaÃ del Colca near Arequipa Shutterstock Arequipa Peru Many parts of Peru experience a dry and a rainy season rather than a summer winter and Arequipa follows suit â yet as a high elevation destination the White City boasts pleasant temperatures pretty much year round Wander the historic streets of Peruâ s second city once its capital down a chicha corn beer and nosh at La Nueva Palomino or admire the beautiful halls of Monasterio de Santa Catalina If youâ re in a more adventurous mood make your way to the nearby CaÃ del Colca to see condors flying high over one of the deepest gorges in the world Tasmania Australia Australia â s strawberry shaped island state offers a different summer experience from what youâ ll find on the mainland thanks to its proximity to the Southern Ocean and the cool winds blowing up from Antarctica Those same winds make weather a bit unpredictable â but hey at least you wonâ t be sweating Enjoy the great outdoors by rafting the Franklin River or walking among Mt Field National Park â s giant swamp gum trees â some of the tallest in the world Try the local wine varietals along the islandâ s east coast if rain threatens your fun count on spending the day at the boundary pushing MONA in Hobart Itâ s hard to break a sweat in MedellÃ n also known as the City of Eternal Spring Shutterstock MedellÃ n Colombia MedellÃ n isnâ t called the City of Eternal Spring for nothing This city while technically north of the equator is spared hardcore heat with tolerable days and cool nights even when things are at their warmest in July and August Take a ride on the MedellÃ nâ s famous Metrocable gondolas for sweeping views of the city head to the El Poblado neighborhood for upscale dining and nightlife or take

for Lonely Planet Cape Town South Africa If youâ re looking for a sophisticated breezy summer getaway somewhere far away head for South Africa â s southwestern coast In Cape Town and around the

the beaches of Bloubergstrand Patagonia Chile and Argentina Chilean and Argentine Patagonia astound with their dramatic mountain peaks and alpine lakes This binational region is at the top of any adventurerâ s travel list â and itâ s an especially apt place to visit if sweltering summers just arenâ t your thing The always present Patagonian wind keeps things cool and summer means raftable
