Where to travel in October TRAVEL Where to travel in October October marks the start of autumn with a bountiful crop of destinations to whet the appetite for food culture and wildlife travel Here are five of our favourites for this month Japan becomes illuminated with colourful trees during the autumn rivalling cherry blossom season in spring Photograph by Sorin Colac Alamy By Sarah Barrell September min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK October heralds the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness the perfect time for trips that embrace the natural world its changing hues and abundant produce From mushrooms to apples pumpkins to olives tours across the UK and Europe are ripe with foodie opportunities whether encountered through a harvest or on a foraging course This is also a great time to be bagging the last beach break of the season while easy access destinations in Southern Europe North Africa and the Middle East are still basking in sunshine and coastal resorts and seasonal ferries have yet to shut up shop But if you re weary of sun and sand October also comes with some tempting urban escapes From Montreal to Manhattan Boston to Baltimore cities along North America s east coast are at their most atmospheric this month rich with fiery autumn colours and Halloween festivities New York USA Combine a city break during Halloween season with a tour upstate to explore hill country when it s vibrant with fall foliage and spooky festivals Along with the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade which sees some costumed revellers walk dance and sing along Sixth Avenue from Canal Street to West Street Manhattan hosts a packed calendar of events in October including Open House New York when sites across the city rarely open to the public throw open their doors from rooftop gardens to design studios and historic houses Meanwhile upstate don t miss The Great Jack O Lantern Blaze where artfully carved pumpkins light up the riverside near Van Cortlandt Manor in the Hudson Valley Sustainable travel tip Skip the road trip in favour of a two wheel tour Making its debut last year the Empire State Trail offers miles of greenways repurposed railway lines and bike paths that can if you have the legs for it take you from Manhattan to the Canadian border We suggest the Hudson Valley Greenway section taking riders through the historic towns and waterfront villages along Hudson River where general stores are replete with pumpkins and the tree carpeted Catskill Mountains burn fiery orange to the north Aerial view

damsons The New Forest is a top autumn break spot the UK s smallest national park packs in a hugely diverse range of landscapes from marshy coast and heathland to its an ancient woodland populated by free roaming ponies For fungi alone it s one of the most important sites in Britain with over different species calling the forest home In autumn the woodland is also home to hundreds of rootling pigs who are allowed free range to clear the ground of acorns beech mast and chestnuts that are harmful to livestock in a practice that dates back to the forest s founder William the Conqueror Sustainable travel tip Foraging is best done under expert guidance to ensure nature s larder is raided sustainably and safely The New Forest National Park has a no pick policy for mushrooms in Sites of Special Scientific Interest Permission is given for walks and educational tours with licenced fungi foray groups Wild Food UK offers a wide range of foraging courses from days out to camping and wild food weekends and trips away to hotels with gourmet chefs While Go Foraging offers guided walks in Hampshire the West Country and Wales New Forest is one of the most important fungi sites in Britain making
