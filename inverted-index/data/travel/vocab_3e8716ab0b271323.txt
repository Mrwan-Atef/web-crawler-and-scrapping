How this guide is preserving Maya culture through food TRAVEL How this guide is preserving Maya culture through food In the wilderness of southern Belize one man is on a mission to conserve and commemorate the ancient Maya way of life including its storied cuisine one garden tour at a time Native to the Maya village of Santa Cruz Jose Mes welcomes visitors to his home to experience the Belizean Mayan culture Photograph by Farida Zeynalova By Farida Zeynalova December This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Using a three foot machete he cuts it with one effortless swoop I dust off the excess mud and pop it in my mouth Within seconds my fingertips are stained fluorescent yellow my taste buds gambolling with punches of pepper and earth But he doesn t stop at turmeric For the next half hour or so he hacks away at mint okra allspice and bird pepper and introduces me to an abundance of medicinal plants that thrive across his two acres of forested land This is no ordinary garden tour But Jose Mes is no ordinary man The year old guide was born and raised here in Santa Cruz a Maya village tucked deep in the jungle of rugged Toledo Belize s most southern and least populated district Jose is from the Mopan community an Indigenous sub group of the ancient Maya civilisation native to Belize and neighbouring Guatemala I m spending the afternoon with him and his wife Hilda to find out about the food culture of Belizean Mayans who make up of the country s strong population By welcoming visitors like me into his home Jose hopes to prove that although they may be few they re certainly very special Nature means a lot to us he tells me guiding me through the shrubbery towards his kitchen We take care of our land because the land takes care of us Food medicine It s the source of everything in our life We trundle through the mud pass the gumbo limbo tree native to Central America and step into his kitchen It s a solitary minimal room detached from the main house The roof was hand built by Jose using native cahune palm leaves and the shelves tables and chairs are made of local wood Jose Mes harvests fresh corn and chikay on his farm Photograph by Farida Zeynalova Hilda fires up the earth oven that will steam cook our lunch before moulding corn dough into tortillas One by one she places the dough circles on a griddle that was brought to Belize via Mexico and Guatemala by her great grandfather Jose turns my attention to the table on which are a kaleidoscope of ingredients native to Central and South America cassava okra pumpkin heart of palm tomatoes habanero cacao green beans chikay shoots of the heliconia plant as well as callaloo and wild chaya both spinach like plants Everything you see here was harvested from my farm in the last hours Jose says adjusting his machete behind his back In this land you don t even have to plant anything For example we throw the okra seeds onto the ground in the dry season when the rain comes they grow Jose then tutors me on the holy grail of Maya cuisine corn There are varieties in Belize the most common being red white yellow and purple In researchers at the ancient site Uxbenka just outside Santa Cruz found evidence of Maya people consuming corn as far back as years ago But safeguarding a custom that s been around since Neolithic times is no easy feat Many of the younger generation don t know how to use the land Jose tells me That s why Tumul K in Center of Learning in nearby Blue Creek is trying to ensure Maya culture is preserved young people are taught skills including planting making fertiliser traditional cooking and more Our lunch is tender pieces of cassava chaya chikay callaloo and heart of palm all served in a bowl made from a hollowed out calabash gourd It s all very warming the heart of palm is subtle and chestnut like and the chaya is slightly milder than spinach but enlivened with Hilda s homemade habanero sauce This is a typical family meal Jose tells me He then pours me a cup of steaming xocolatl a bitter ancient ancestor of hot chocolate proudly announcing that it was the Maya who first cultivated the cacao bean We tuck in and fall silent for a few minutes bar the sound of clucking chickens outside My dad was a hunter and we grew up fishing and eating a lot of meat snails and jungle vegetables says Jose scooping up some cassava with a piece of tortilla Passing on skills such as cooking harvesting and seed storing important in the face of climate change and extinction to his children and community is crucial to him as is protecting the land and its people Farmers from at least seven other communities in Toledo come to buy seeds from the local seed bank at Uxbenka Jose says but must return double what they buy ensuring farmers in Santa Cruz are supported and make a decent living As I say my goodbyes Jose leaves me with an ode to his community s unwavering subsistence We re the Indigenous people of Belize and we love to share who we are Many people around the world don t even know we re here but we are he says gesturing to the land around us Still here Still existing Still living How to do it Toledo
