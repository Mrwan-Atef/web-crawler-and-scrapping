wildlife To the east of Everglades National Park Biscayne National Park brings forth a pristine and magical side of Florida It s the nation s largest marine park and the largest national park boasting living coral reefs within the continental U S A small portion of the park s acres includes mainland coast and outlying islands but remains submerged Of particular interest are the mangroves and their
