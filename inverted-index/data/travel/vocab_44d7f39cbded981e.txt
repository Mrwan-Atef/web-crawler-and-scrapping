eBooks Download instantly and read any time Explore all products Travel Stories Italy Rome Share hours in Rome a perfect day in the Italian capital Brekke Fletcher Jul min read Share Cover a lot of ancient ground including the Roman Forum with this day long Rome itinerary Rome is the eternal city â but you do not need an eternity to get a real taste for Roman life In a place where history teams from every cobblestone edifice and dilapidated wall Rome may not have been built in a day but it is entirely doable in one This itinerary assumes an early morning arrival How do I get from the airport to the city Take the Leonardo Express from Leonardo da Vinci International Airport to Roma Termini Stazione Termini The train takes minutes and costs â each way A taxi will take nearly twice that long and cost five times as much so itâ s by far the best choice Advertisement If you have bags there are luggage storage options at the airport for â per bag and also at Termini â ideal if youâ ve got a heavy suitcase and need to ditch it for the day From Termini you can get to any part of Rome fairly easily Take a taxi a bus or the Metro to your hotel or your first stop Enjoy the view from rooftop terrace at Hotel Locarno in Rome Hotel Locarno Where should I stay If youâ re in Rome overnight Hotel Locarno is a centrally located boutique hotel a stone s throw from Piazza del Popolo with a charming outdoor patio where you can take all meals and a rooftop terrace thatâ s open in the evenings I jumped at the chance to stay here if only for a night and I canâ t think of a better place to hang your hat Breakfast was included with the rate I booked though not on the morning you check in Be sure to check your rate on their website before booking Accommodation in Centro Storico is close to everything but there are few budget options For a more vibey area near Stazione Termini check out options in Monti What should I do Rome is best viewed early in the morning Itâ s relatively quiet with fewer crowds so I d advocate for heading to the ancient Roman sites as soon as you fuel up Breakfast in Rome consists of a cappuccino and a pastry Brekke Fletcher Lonely Planet Morning Breakfast in Rome is not a big affair â just a cappuccino and a cornetto an Italian croissant I chose to do this in the garden after checking in to Hotel Locarno but thereâ s no shortage of places to grab and go Hit up the nearest pasticceria cake shop once you are ready to start your day â or make a beeline for Roscioli Caffe it opens at Monday through Saturday on Sunday on your ramble to your first stops in Ancient Rome Pro tip Some shops and restaurants are closed on Sundays and Mondays so check out all the spots youâ re hoping to visit before you head on out Rome is a wonderful city to explore on foot if you are able The charm history and street life you encounter are ceaselessly fascinating Every aspect of life is on display if you open your eyes and ears to it Wear comfortable shoes as well over steps over uneven terrain are in your future Visiting the hypogeum â a vast network of subterranean rooms cells tunnels and passages â is a unique way to experience the Colosseum Jared I Lenz Photography Getty Images Ancient Rome s greatest hits Whether you re starting from Termini or Locarno walk to minutes to the Colosseum Romeâ s huge gladiatorial arena which is usually crowded but less so if you start early I recommend booking a guided tour to visit the hypogeum where gladiators and animals were prepped before taking the stage This is an entirely different way to experience this iconic structure especially fun if youâ ve already been there done that Advertisement From there you can roam get it over to the Palatino to poke around ancient ruins before descending into the Roman Forum Just get any and all tickets in advance so you donâ t have to wander around looking for the lines and kiosks Pro tip There are plenty of tours on offer that will get you into all of these sites Try the bucatini all Amatriciana at La Buca di Ripetta Brekke Fletcher Lonely Planet Afternoon Before you go to a very well earned lunch take a minute walk to Area Sacra di Largo di Torre Argentina the site where Julius Caesar was murdered in BC These ruins among the oldest in the city are accessible via a new footpath that opened in Itâ s also home to a thriving stray cat population and a volunteer run cat sanctuary Itâ s surprisingly uncrowded and relatively quick to view At this point you ll be getting a bit foot weary so take it slow while you stroll along Via del Corso Rome s high fashion thoroughfare In about minutes you ll arrive at the casual yet refined La Buca di Ripetta with its dining room s centerpiece Vespa Any pasta from the menu will satisfy your appetite for carbs I ordered the bucatini all Amatriciana a steal at â Rest up after lunch with a hotel nap followed by a stroll through Villa Borghese Brekke Fletcher Lonely Planet Park it After lunch I recommend doing one of two things if youâ re staying at the hotel return to take a nap or wander towards Villa Borghese minutes to relax and chill out I advocate for napping if youâ re staying overnight â itâ s very Roman If you canâ t stand the idea of being idle then explore the best park in Rome or just sit on a bench under a tree and people watch After youâ ve taken a load off make your way to Museo e Galleria Borghese the lauded museum located in the park to cool down and see this masterful collection of sculptures mosaics and paintings Be sure thereâ s a theme here to book your timed entry ticket should be around or in advance Pro tip Casa del Cinema at Villa Borghese shows outdoor films at their Ettore Scola open air theater on summer nights from June to early September Admission is free on a first come first served basis Evening From the museum it should be about time to aperitivo and the garden at the Hassler Hotel is an ideal place for just that and only a to minute walk from the museum though I chose to have a negroni at Terazza Locarno the rooftop terrace bar at the hotel You do not need to get gussied up in Rome unless you want to or are going to partake in some fine dining But I like to take a quick shower after my aperitivo before making my way to dinner Again this depends on whether youâ re overnighting in a hotel No day in Rome is complete without gelato from Gioletti Brekke Fletcher Lonely Planet The last supper Dinner is usually late in the evening but I like to eat early The first reservation at my restaurant of choice Armando al Pantheon is at This place is very popular with good reason so itâ s imperative to book in advance Centrally located this testament to Roman cooking has been around since the food is consistently delicious I love the lamb and itâ s just a minute walk to Giolitti for post dinner gelato Pro tip At Giolitti you need to pay for your gelato before you order it Wander around to see the Pantheon and the Trevi Fountain while enjoying your sweet treat If youâ re like me youâ re beat and are yearning for your bed â though there are plenty of great spots to continue the evening in Centro Storico Two excellent nearby options are speakeasy Club DerriÃ re or cocktail bar The Gin Corner Finally and just to be on the safe side always be mindful of your surroundings Rome isnâ t dangerous per se but itâ s a busy crowded city not without crime or pickpockets so pay attention to what youâ re doing and keep your possessions secure As a woman who frequently travels alone this is advice I live by Advertisement Advertisement
