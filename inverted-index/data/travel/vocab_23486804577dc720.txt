and city culture Anita Isalska Jul min read Share The mighty High Tatras â which include the crooked peak of KrivÃ Å â are some of Slovakiaâ s star attractions Getty Images Most travelers get a taste of Slovakia on a city break in the capital Bratislava or by hiking in the famous Tatras Yet well beyond its numerous castles and cobbled old towns the Central European country offers much more Nowadays many of Slovakiaâ s historic buildings are incubators for contemporary art and cuisine And while the High Tatras are indeed and should be a prime draw Slovakiaâ s other national parks abound with forests meadows and alpine lakes plus cycling and hiking trails galore Many countries can boast such a range of attractions â but few have it all such a modestly sized easy to travel package Trains connect Slovakia to capitals across services Europe bus services are abundant and driving yourself is easy Won over yet Hereâ s our rundown of Slovakiaâ s best places to visit Slovakia is one of the best countries to visit next year See our full list of Best in Travel winners The UFO atop Most SNP bridge is an icon of Bratislavaâ s weird and wonderful architecture Walter Bibikow Getty Images Bratislava Best for merrymaking and monumental architecture Itâ s not hard to find thirsty tourists stumbling across Bratislava â s cobblestones in search of their next LÃ nius beer or more bravely their next round of Slivovitz plum brandy Yet while the Slovak capital has a well earned reputation as a party town even devoted revelers take in some culture along the way Expect a showcase of architecture from across the centuries Michaelâ s Tower the cityâ s original gate dates from the Middle Ages as does the cityâ s crowning castle The art nouveau Blue Church is a gem of early century design while at the Slovak National Gallery art is exhibited in an award winning gallery space And all around the brutish beauty of the socialist era is still present in oddities like the UFO home to a rotating restaurant and the defiantly upside down Slovak Radio Building Bratislava is also an ideal base for day trips Within minutes by road you can storm Ä KameÅ Castle take a spa day in PieÅ Å any drink in the views from DevÃ nska Kobyla Observation Tower or climb TrenÄ Ã nâ s clock tower for a birdâ s eye view Planning tip Summer festivals help you see the city at its regal best Plan around Middle Ages in the Park in June or the later summer Coronation Days Hiking the High Tatras never disappoints Shutterstock The High Tatras Best for mountain thrills With peaks that reach as high as northern Slovakiaâ s mountains have acquired near mythic status These fearsome mountains and valleys were carved by glaciers during the Ice Age today the High Tatras particularly the crooked peak of KrivÃ Å are symbols of national pride Mixed ability groups head straight for idyllic strolls at glacial PopradskÃ Pleso lake while tougher day long treks like the FurkotskÃ Valley Loop and the KÃ provsky Å tit Ascent appeal to hardier hikers Itâ s easy to travel green too the Tatra Electric Railway travels between Å trbskÃ Pleso a lakeside resort town with lovely walking trails right up to the lofty mountain resort TatranskÃ Lomnica The best way to stay connected Saily provides a hassle free solution to travel data â just choose your data plan and prepare for your trip When you get to your destination you can go online right away Get your eSIM Skiers also have plenty of reasons to head to the High Tatras JasnÃ NÃ zke Tatry is the biggest ski area with more than miles of trails while the highest resort TatranskÃ Lomnica tops out at Planning tip The highest hikes donâ t open until mid June so go in midsummer if youâ re scaling lofty peaks like KrivÃ Å or Rysy Otherwise Septemberâ s mellow sunshine is ideal for hitting the trails HrnÄ iarska in KoÅ iceâ s Old Town is packed with galleries and cafes Shutterstock KoÅ ice Best for modern art and medieval finery Second cities have an appealing vibe all the size and sophistication of a capital only with fewer tourists and a scrappy attitude This describes KoÅ ice through and through For those who like their beauty with a bit of an edge itâ s irresistible The forbiddingly Gothic St Elizabethâ s Cathedral anchors a plaza graced by a plague column grand town hall and century chapel These layers of history are best peeled back along art studioâ and cafe lined HrnÄ iarska long the abode of the cityâ s artisans Meanwhile TabaÄ ka Kulturfabrik has transformed into a coworking spaceâ performance spaceâ anything goes bar slash venue Itâ s creative messy â and quintessentially KoÅ ice Planning tip There are no fewer than UNESCO World Heritage sights within a couple of hours by road from KoÅ ice with the most enchanting along the Wooden Churches Trail Hire a driver or rent a car to do a loop taking in LadomirovÃ Hervatov and summoning a church custodian to unlock these art filled churches is part of the fun With its walkways and ladders Raj is more like an adventure playground than national park Shutterstock Raj National Park Best for waterfalls and rivers Of the nine national parks within Slovakiaâ s borders this might just be our favorite â Slovak Paradise â is more akin to an adventure playground than a wilderness Streams wind through this landscape of forests and karst cliffs forcing visitors to climb ladders and balance along wooden walkways to navigate trails like the ever popular SuchÃ BelÃ Gorge and KlÃ Å torskÃ Gorge with its three waterfalls Cycling is a delightful way to explore too there are miles of bike trails within the park and more in the surrounding countryside Rent wheels in the gateway town of SpiÅ skÃ NovÃ Ves or in Podlesok within the park Though winter is much quieter you can cross country ski on marked walking trails or head to the small ski area at Mlynky Planning tip A worthwhile detour just outside the park is DobÅ inskÃ Ice Cave which is open to tours of its frosty stalagmites between mid May and late August Nestled in the mountains BanskÃ Å tiavnica is a beautifully preserved gem of a town Shutterstock BanskÃ Å tiavnica Best for culture both above and below ground Is BanskÃ Å tiavnica the prettiest town in Central Europe We think itâ s a strong contender Gothic and Renaissance churches and houses make it a veritable jewel box of architecture and itâ s huddled inside an extinct volcanic caldera This medieval settlement in the midst of the Å tiavnica Mountains garnered a UNESCO World Heritage listing not for its beauty but its remarkable engineering history itâ s Slovakiaâ s oldest gold and silver mining town Strolling around the historic village â from elegant Trinity Square to the not so new New Castle century â is more than eye candy itâ s a glimpse into an industry that transformed the whole region The Slovak Mining Museum takes you deep down into the heart of the townâ s mining past Up above KalvÃ ria a unique complex of Baroque churches and chapels overlooks BanskÃ Å tiavnica from a hilltop east of town Traditionally designed buildings grace the mountain village of Peter Vrabel Shutterstock Best for authentic mountain culture The village of s setting is simply lovely in the Belianske Tatras right by the border with Poland surrounded by glorious hiking and biking trails as well as caves you can visit nearby What makes it even more special is the distinct flavor of Goral culture in everything from its food to its ornately painted houses Goral people have lived in northern Slovakia and southern Poland ever since the century when Wallachian shepherds migrated north to these rugged lands Today Goral identity remains an unmistakable feature of the town noticeable in s log houses which are traditionally decorated with geometric patterns in blue and red paint The old ways are carefully preserved in the Dom folk museum â and served up at the adjoining traditional restaurant Expect sheepâ s cheese galore Tokaj Region Best for idyllic wine country Hungary has hogged the acclaim for sweet white Tokaj wine a so called â liquid goldâ once served to royals and still gracing the dessert menus of many fine dining restaurants Yet much of the Tokaj wine region formerly entirely within the Kingdom of Hungary landed within the borders of modern day Slovakia at the end of the First World War Today southeastern Slovakia boasts more than a dozen wineries Hand dug underground cellars provide deliciously rustic settings to sample Tokaj wine usually with cheeses and cold meats to cleanse your palate in between each sweet sip The Jaroslav and Tokaj Macik wineres both long standing and family run offer the full experience Reserve tastings ahead Planning tip Wine villages like TÅ Å a are only an hour by road from KoÅ ice â but itâ s much more sensible not to mention enjoyable to stay overnight Many wineries have on site rooms another appealing option is a stay in a tree house at Camping MalÃ Bara Among the countless castles in Slovakia SpiÅ might be the most evocative Getty Images SpiÅ skÃ Podhradie Best castle and hilltop views In a country with more than castles to visit choosing a favorite is tough But if we had to hide from a trebuchet attack anywhere in Slovakia weâ d pick SpiÅ Standing imperiously on a high hilltop SpiÅ Castle has withstood centuries of battles thanks to its stocky towers and defensive walls Itâ s one of Central Europeâ s biggest strongholds And thanks to a Gothic makeover of its palace itâ s as attractive as it is imposing On clear days you can see all the way to the Tatras SpiÅ skÃ Podhradie is no one trick town just west lies the SpiÅ skÃ Kapitula whose architecture â a mix of Romanesque turrets and splashy Baroque finery â has earned it the nickname â Slovakiaâ s Vatican â The village has a small but excellent array of guesthouses and restaurants too we recommend the farmhouse fare at merry SpiÅ sky SalaÅ Planning tip Just miles west is the town of LevoÄ a with a fine town hall and a small cluster of art and medieval museums The highlight is the dreamy view of LevoÄ aâ s church spires and defensive walls from the hilltop Basilica of the Virgin Mary â a view guaranteed to inspire dreams of your next trip Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address
