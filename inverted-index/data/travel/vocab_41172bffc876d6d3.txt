Brendan Sainsbury Jan min read Share Getting to the heart of Havana s neighborhoods will take you past everything from faded glamor to late night salsa sessions Â xavierarnau Getty Images Havana has three indispensable city center neighborhoods that travelers with more than a couple of days on their hands should visit Thereâ s beautifully restored Habana Vieja Old Havana a celebrated UNESCO World Heritage Site gritty Centro Habana where theatrical street life plays out alongside palatial civic buildings and nationally important museums and the more modern commercial hub of Vedado whose faded glamor is reflected in its boxy skyscrapers former mafia run hotels and musical nightlife Dip into all three and youâ ll get a little closer to understanding what this enigmatic city is all about If youâ re staying longer youâ ll have time to seek out beaches street art projects and unusual architecture in a scattering of outlying districts Here are the seven Havana neighborhoods that you must visit Advertisement Shopping at one of the stalls at Plaza de Armas Â lembi Shutterstock Habana Vieja Best neighborhood for a history lesson Anchored by four diminutive squares around which the original walled city grew in the early contemporary Habana Vieja is the result of a dynamic historical renovation project that was achieved against the odds during a time of great economic scarcity starting in the Today the sq km sq mile UNESCO World Heritage Site is akin to a neighborhood sized museum but with one big difference people live here â of them The cityscape is at once grandiose and gritty Schools and maternity homes overlook cobbled tourist packed squares Meticulously restored pharmacies still hand out prescriptions to qualifying locals while the deconsecrated church of San Francisco de AsÃ s acts as both a museum of religious art and Havanaâ s finest classical concert hall Containing around buildings of historical importance the neighborhood is an obligatory starting point for any tour of Havana You can peruse dozens of museums highlighting everything from playing cards to medals coins and banknotes An abundance of handsome hotels are atmospherically encased in erstwhile colonial era digs Donâ t miss arterial Calle Obispo the always crowded shopping street Plaza de la Catedral with its haunting baroque church and the bohemian bars of Plaza del Cristo where live music seems to blast out of every window and door Centro Habana contains multitudes from boisterous quarters to marvelous museums Â John Elk III Getty Images Centro Habana Best neighborhood for aimless strolling Centro Habana is Havanaâ s heart and soul a noisy dilapidated but safe neighborhood where life is lived out in the open and the beautiful din of salsa competes with the rattle and hum of asthmatic American cars coursing along its narrow streets Demarcated to the north by the broad curve of the sea drive its colorful thoroughfares make for essential strolling See older men slapping down dominoes at tables set up curbside listen to the shouts of pregoneros street criers selling fruit door to door and inhale the aroma of old cigars mixed with pineapples and diesel fumes Contrasting with this buoyant quarter is the very different world of Parque Central and El Prado a busy tourism focused corridor thatâ s home to Havana s poshest hotels and some of its finest museums including the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes and the Museo de la Vedado Best neighborhood for evening activities The polar opposite of Habana Vieja Vedado looks like a cross between Hausmannâ s Paris and a mildly disheveled American city Advertisement Large urban lots are home to elegant villas and tropical gardens while radial avenues laid out in the and emanate from its extravagantly large square Plaza de la The hotspot of Havanaâ s tawdry nightlife in the Vedado still has a strong nocturnal pulse Jazz clubs flamboyant cabaret and the FÃ brica de Arte Cubano the countryâ s ultimate art and performance space are all based here along with multiple cinemas and the block sized Coppelia ice cream complex Vedado is a great place to sit on the sea wall with a bottle of rum and shoot the breeze with the amassed fishers trumpet blasters canoodling couples and Florida gazers For a more refined sundowner head to the breezy gardens of the iconic Hotel Nacional for a mojito in the bar where Frank Sinatra and Winston Churchill once puffed cigars Another atmospheric place for sunset strolling is Havanaâ s gigantic cemetery the a veritable city of the dead thatâ s imbued with history religious apparitions and who knows ghosts Miramar Best neighborhood for atmospheric dining Once opulent Miramar in the municipality of Playa is a leafy diplomatic quarter of broad avenues sprawling ficus trees and fine private restaurants The architecture is largely eclectic verging on fanciful The huge quasi stately homes were invariably built by rich business people just before the revolution and requisitioned by the government soon after Today they serve as foreign embassies and offices for state run enterprises and a few have even been turned into boutique hotels After gawking at the pretty houses you can enjoy some shade in El Bosque de la Habana where the neighborhoodâ s leafiness goes into overdrive in a wild riverside park Miramar courtesy of its history as a diplomatic quarter has long been a bastion of good private restaurants with a couple of state run places too Scattered around its tree lined streets are nods to Italian Lebanese Spanish and of course Cuban cuisine in settings that are both refined and romantic Longstanding favorites include Paladar Vista Mar for its seafood and La Cocina de Lilliam for its Cuban European fusion Western Miramar starting at Calle has a plush business center and a growing cluster of modern hotels that are popular with the conventional crowd Better and more convenient accommodations can be found in Habana Vieja and Centro Habana Casablanca and the forts Best neighborhood for forts This sleepy boat dock and its surrounding cluster of houses on the eastern side of Havana harbor is overlooked by several popular city sights a tall statue of Christ and the cityâ s two largest forts Thereâ s the distinctive Castillo del Morro with its sentinel lighthouse and the strapping CabaÃ a the largest Spanish fort in the Americas Although geographically separated from Habana Vieja the forts are included in its prestigious UNESCO listing Exploring their museums ramparts and various nooks and crannies could fill half a day Small ferries cross the harbor from Habana Vieja to Casablanca or you can take a taxi through the road tunnel Time your visit for early evening and linger for the CaÃ onazo cannon firing ceremony in La CabaÃ a A couple of decent restaurants serve dinner in the area Don t miss Fusterlandia in Jaimanitas â it s an explosion of color and design Â Cinematographer Shutterstock Jaimanitas Best neighborhood for street art Until years ago no one knew much about the working class fishing community of Jaimanitas apart from the people who lived there But thanks to the slow but painstaking work of a local artist named JosÃ Fuster whispers of recognition became murmurs and then shouts What Fuster has created over a year period is a fantastical street art project known as Fusterlandia that continues to draw in tourists by the busload Covering more than houses in the neighborhood with murals mosaics and other pieces of surreal art and sculpture inspired by the likes of GaudÃ and Picasso he has single handedly transformed his community into one of Havanaâ s top sights Jaimanitas is located miles west of Centro Habana in the municipality of Playa A series of local buses will get you there but itâ s easier to organize a taxi A quick bus ride from Old Havana leads to the popular Guanabo beach Â Okan Ataman Shutterstock Guanabo Best neighborhood for lying on the beach Guanabo is a beach community that feels more like a large village than a buzzing urban neighborhood It sits at the eastern end of Havanaâ s elongated beach strip Playas del Este with access to rambunctious Playa Guanabo one block north of the neighborhoodâ s main avenue or the quieter Playa Boca Ciega about miles to the west Beyond the beaches this neighborhood has little in the way of sights but plenty to prick your curiosity Untouched yet by suburban sprawl Guanabo prefers to see itself as a traditional Cuban village where spontaneous reggaeton parties erupt on the sand and horse and cart is still the preferred method of getting around To get here like a local hop on bus next to the train station in Habana Vieja If you fancy staying overnight Guanabo has a liberal smattering of family run casas particulares private homestays Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address Subscribe now Subscribe to Lonely Planet
