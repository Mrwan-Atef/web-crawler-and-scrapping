ways families can become happier travelers according to researchers As pandemic restrictions lift researchers say that designing trips based on your family s interests rather than a guidebook s must see list can lead to more authentic experiences in such places as Portofino Italy Photograph by Luca Antonio Lorenzelli Alamy Stock Photo TRAVEL FAMILY ways families can become happier travelers according to researchers Post pandemic we all want to travel more meaningfully One tip Ditch the bucket list By Amy Brecount White February min read If there s one thing pandemic lockdowns have taught us it s that the ability to travel is a gift to approach with reverence and gratitude In many of us want to travel differently because we ve changed The pandemic has opened our eyes to our fragile world and to our own physical and psychological frailties Travel traditions such as keeping a bucket list now seem flippant almost irreverent And so very says Jacqui Gifford the editor in chief of Travel Leisure Bucket list travel has become tone deaf especially during a pandemic The idea that you must itemize destinations to see before you die and that those select destinations will have a grander impact on your physical being or mental health than others seems silly The lifting of pandemic restrictions gives parents an opportunity to help kids develop a healthy mindset around travel one based on values of engagement and empathy rather than achievement and acquisition We seek more purposeful interactions at our destinations and we want our footsteps across the planet to imprint less but mean more Research backs the concept that exploring more mindfully not only benefits a destination but also our own personal health and happiness Here are four ways families and kids can travel better Know why you re traveling Jaime Kurtz a psychologist at James Madison University and author of The Happy Traveler Unpacking the Secrets of Better Vacation suggests starting any trip planning with the question why do I want to take this trip Search within yourself she advises Why did I pick this place What makes me feel happy and fulfilled Instead of checking off some guidebook s list of must see sites connect with your family s interests and passions and use that to design a trip that s more authentic to you she says It might also inspire you to explore beyond your usual boundaries Research the history of the people and places before you visit them Kurtz recommends Consider taking a destination pledge such as the Sedona Cares Pledge which encourages visitors to follow their sixth sense of responsibility and respect the area s trails and heritage Several popular destinations including Iceland New Zealand Palau and Big Sur in California suggest travelers read and sign their destination pledges before arriving Here are amazing adventures for the year ahead While you re traveling Kurtz suggests getting to know people s stories and finding ways to empathize with the people in the place as opposed to just seeing them as a spectacle If you and your kids listen to others more attentively and ignore distractions such as your phone or getting Insta worthy photos that enhanced focus can lead to more authentic understanding and connections The more we can get to know the place on a deeper level the more we re going to care about preserving it and treating it with respect and treating the people there with respect For her own excursions Kurtz hires local guides who often share their personal stories They may connect you and your kids to lesser known adventures local makers and local restaurants Your dollars will then support that destination more directly Invest in experiences not things We are happier research shows when we spend our time and money on experiences rather than things Choosing the experience of travel usually has personal rewards beyond the trip itself says Amit Kumar an assistant professor of psychology and marketing at the University of Texas Austin Although his research doesn t focus exclusively on travel it does reveal that a whole host of benefits can arise from spending on doing versus spending on having Consuming experiences attending a concert or snorkeling a reef together is more likely to make you happy than buying a bigger TV This is why travel should be considered an essential human activity Experiential purchases like travel tend to be more reflective of one s identity or sense of self Kumar says Compared to expenditures on material possessions investing in these experiences tend to be the kind of investment that contributes to who we are And that can translate into how you and your kids interact with the world It can also inspire gratitude Marc Woodward of Bellingham Washington and his two year old daughter Liliana hike the Trans Catalina Trail on California s Santa Catalina Island on June Experts say that consuming experiences such as hiking rather than collecting objects can inspire gratitude and generosity to others Photograph by Allen J Schaben Los Angeles Times Getty Images When people think about these experiences rather than their possessions they actually end up being more generous to others he says For example if you feel grateful to be hiking through the Sonoran Desert and getting to know new people and learning about the delicate ecosystem you might tip more generously or teach your kids to use water more respectfully And the travel gift keeps giving says Kumar We all know that joyful glow of anticipation before a trip but your whole family can also look forward to building closer bonds with friends and other families through your after trip storytelling Here s why grateful children deal better with life s challenges Discover how the brain benefits from travel Your travels both near and far may actually boost your family s overall brain health says neuropsychologist Paul Nussbaum an adjunct professor of neurological surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and founder of the Brain Health Center On a physiological level travel is very good for the brain he says Initially doing new things like learning to surf or trying an unfamiliar local delicacy may be challenging but will become easier because brain plasticity is such that you re beginning to develop physiological cellular connections to do those things says Nussbaum Something that was foreign is now more familiar As you face problems or challenges to solve in your travels your hippocampi keep forming new networks and your brain thrives Nussbaum says he even toys with the possibility of doctors prescribing travel for brain health But your family can always self prescribe more travel as part of your wellness journey It s a kind of universal massage of the brain that travel provides us Nussbaum says Learn how thinking about your next trip can boost mental health Center your family in their own travel narrative Neuroscience and functional MRI studies have revealed that multiple parts of our brain engage and have heightened connectivity while and after we consume fictional stories As we read or watch a story parts of our brains can even light up as if we were the characters in action So here s my idea for a way to replace the outdated bucket list with what I call an encounter list What if we more consciously envision ourselves as the main character in our evolving stories When your kids perceive themselves as the main character of their story they can feel more aware of their agency of their power to craft a narrative they can be proud of And travel is one of the most vibrant and memory making parts of any self construction These books may inspire your next adventure Ask yourself in what novel settings might you place your family this year What complex characters do you hope your kids intersect with What out of your box adventures will your family take on Then imagine all the ways your lives might spark with greater engagement and connectivity Amy Brecount White is a writer based in Virginia who aspires to deepen her family s connections to the world Follow her on Instagram and Twitter Related Topics FAMILY TRAVEL GREEN
