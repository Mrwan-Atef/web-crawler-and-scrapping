beaches Since then development has truly kicked off in this region but worry not â while some beaches can be well and truly mobbed in summer with a little patience you can still find opportunities to kick back and enjoy the empty beaches the region was once so famous for The Czartoryski Museum and Library in Neirfy Shutterstock Poland is the most quintessentially Polish of cities a place steeped

find it here Europe can get busy in summer when you ll have to compete for a space on Italy s beaches Martina De Pascali for Lonely Planet When is the best season to visit Europe Europe is a big place spanning many different kinds of terrain â the best time to visit will vary based on the countries you want to see and your tolerance for heat cold and crowds Visiting Europe in summer July and August are undoubtedly the busiest months in Europe particularly in the most visited countries such as France Italy Spain and Greece In recent years Mediterranean regions have faced extreme heat and wildfires in the summer months with popular attractions such as the Acropolis in Athens closing to tourists due to dangerously high temperatures In France the south heaves with visitors in the summer but locals head out on their own summer vacations and many businesses around the country close in August even in Paris Summer can be a great time to visit some of Europeâ s cooler northern regions such as Scandinavia where long days and warm temperatures make this a great time for outdoor pursuits â the midnight sun means you can enjoy bright evenings out that last well into the next morning Across the continent accommodation prices will be at their highest in summer and booking well in advance is recommended Visiting Europe in spring and autumn The spring from April to May and early autumn September and October are both great times to visit Europe though spring school holidays and Easter vacations can bring crowds closures and disruptions in many places Crowds and prices will be smaller than in mid summer though destinations such as Italy remain busy throughout the year Luckily there are plenty of destinations in Europe that are perfectly suited for an autumn escape or spring break Visiting Europe in winter During the winter months ski resorts throughout the Alps and other European mountain ranges flood with alpine enthusiasts and shoppers crowd Christmas markets in major cities but the cold season can bring closures in spots that depend on summer tourism including some Greek islands For a dose of winter sun many European travelers look to sun warmed islands such as the Balearics the Canaries and Malta Winter is ski season across Europe from the French and Swiss Alps to the cross country trails of Scandinavia Shutterstock Can I visit multiple countries in Europe during my trip With its many land borders Europe was made for country hopping â â just ask the generations of backpackers and Interrailers who have meandered across it by road rail and bicycle How much of Europe you can see in one trip comes down to how much time you have and how packed you want your itinerary to be Continental Europe is well connected by rail and a resurgence of night trains is making it even easier to get around without the carbon footprint of flying Travelers can also take the Eurostar train from continental Europe to Great Britain much less hassle than traveling by plane However be aware of the immigration restrictions that apply to the Schengen Area which includes most of the countries in continental Europe If you need to apply for a Schengen Visa you ll be able to visit multiple European nations within the Schengen Area but only for a maximum of days within any day period If you re lucky enough to have a passport from a European Union country you can travel freely across Europe with few restrictions Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Take your travels to the next level Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started
