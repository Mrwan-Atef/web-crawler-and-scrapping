Lisbon on a high daring street art and hilltop lookouts in Portugal s capital The view from Miradouro da Senhora do Monte is one of Lisbon s major landmarks perched upon a hillside in the Graça neighbourhood Photograph by Mark Parren Taylor TRAVEL Lisbon on a high daring street art and hilltop lookouts in Portugal s capital Trams and tuk tuks roller coaster through the hills of the Portuguese capital a city of enticing lookouts al fresco lunches and daring street art By Kerry Walker Photographs by Mark Parren Taylor June min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Morning breaks over Lisbon s seven hills In the medina like lanes of Alfama one of the city s oldest loftiest neighbourhoods the light is beginning to creep through window shutters washing over the azulejo tiles and bathing the terracotta rooftops in an amber glow in the distance the Tagus river glitters Slowly pearl white domes and spires come into focus and then the facades in a fresco painter s palette of pastels At this hour there isn t another soul with me at the Largo das Portas do Sol the original Moorish gateway to the district It s a vantage point that offers views over Lisbon s historic heart that are worth rising early for Ever since the Moors built their castle here in the century this has been a city that has made the most of its lofty position Miradouros viewpoints cling to the hilltops like eyries each one giving a different eagle s eye view You re forever climbing catching your breath and trying to keep your footing on the steep cobbled lanes The yellow vintage trams trundling through Lisbon s hilly streets are an icon of the city Photograph by Mark Parren Taylor When an earthquake razed most of Lisbon to the ground in Alfama remained resolutely standing As I wander deeper into its alleys the aroma of coffee the crackles of a poorly tuned radio and the barking of a dog drift towards me through open windows A woman in a floral pinafore beats a rug against a wall greeting me with a broad toothless smile and a bom dia The district feels timeless but in nearby Graça the situation couldn t be more different While Alfama is high Graça is even higher still set on the tallest hill Over the past decade the district has been reimagined as a blank canvas for street artists enabling it to reach new heights on Lisbon s cultural scene To understand this city look at its walls Véro Léon van Grieken tells me with a shy smile when we meet later that morning She s a Belgian expat working as a guide with Lisbon Street Art Tours wrapped in layers of hand knitted cardigans As we trudge uphill from Alfama to Graça Véro s little dog trotting obediently in our wake she points out Half Young Panda a shockingly bright mural of a panda created from street rubbish by Lisbon born trash art king Bordalo II otherwise known as Artur Bordalo Afterwards we admire the intricacy of homegrown artist Vhils portrait of fado superstar Amália Rodrigues It s a tidal wave of hundreds of cobblestones rolling halfway up a wall pieced together in collaboration with an expert team of calçada portuguesa Portuguese paving masters Vhils started as a tagger but got his big break collaborating with Banksy at the Cans Festival in Véro explains Now he uses explosives demolition tools and chemicals to carve the city walls in a process he calls creative destruction You might think this would ruffle local feathers but Lisboetas hardly bat an eyelid she assures me Such daring street art contrasts with the graceful Renaissance spires of Graça s Monastery of São Vicente de Fora overlooking the broad blue arm of the river and the dome of the baroque National Pantheon We round a bend and reach Campo de Santa Clara square where the Feira da Ladra flea market springs up on Tuesdays and Saturdays Here an azulejo panel running along a metre long wall catches my eye It depicts a fantastical cityscape filled with rainbows crenellated towers and hot air balloons accompanied by a doodle of a spindly legged top hatted man the hallmark of Swedish French street artist André Saraiva Véro calls him the godfather of contemporary urban art as he was one of the first to break onto the street art scene having covered Paris in illegal graffiti in the Azulejo art at Campo de Santa Clara square runs along a metre long wall depicting a fantastical cityscape Photograph by Mark Parren Taylor Next we venture off piste to a car park behind a block of flats to contemplate murals of giant cats and cubist Picasso like portraits painted during a festival devoted to female street artists After that it s on to Shepard Fairey s Revolution Woman which depicts a freedom fighter holding a machine gun with a flower inserted into the barrel a nod to military coup the Carnation Revolution which ended over years of dictatorship in Portugal But most arresting of all is Tropical Fado in RGB by Lisbon based street artist OzeArv a rainbow bright eruption of birds and flowers that spreads up the side of a three storey apartment block I meet OzeArv aka José Carvalho over a pancake brunch in retro cool cafe Maria Limão in the heart of Graça where his intricate foliage murals grow wildly up the walls A warm charismatic softly spoken man with a crop of curly hair and an easy childlike smile José started tagging in the then took his colourful street art all over the world Lisbon is now once again his canvas With street art you can paint wherever you want he says It creates a cultural dialogue with communities and gives underrepresented people a voice even a sense of pride In this way it can be a catalyst for social change It s a shared experience people feel free to give their opinions He continues I get much pleasure from being up on the crane or on climbing ropes high above ground level drawing my dreams I like to combine the graphic with the realistic use clashing colours and hide stories within stories And Lisbon has the best light to paint India is the only other country I know with this kind of golden light In search of that same light I make it my mission to seek out Lisbon s most enticing lookouts to best take it in I begin a quick tram ride south of Graça with a leisurely city gazing breakfast on the roof terrace of boho The Lumiares Hotel Spa It s shoehorned into the sloping bar rammed lanes of the Bairro Alto district where Lisbon parties by night and quietly nurses a hangover by day Set in an century former palace the hotel is an ode to Lisbon s light with painter and muralist Jacqueline de Montaigne s huge dreamlike murals of gold haloed women framed by fluttering swallows sweeping up staircases After work many Lisboetas gravitate towards quiosques gazebo like kiosk cafes in the city s parks gardens squares and miradouros They sell inexpensive wine beer coffee and snacks Photograph by Mark Parren Taylor At the nearby Miradouro São Pedro de Alcântara people are already sipping piña coladas to reggae beats mid morning with the city spread at their feet There s a hint of spring in the air with the first puffs of blossom evident on the trees between the tinkling fountains scattered around Backtracking through the shuttered lanes of Bairro Alto towards the river I follow steps down to the gardens of Miradouro de Santa Catarina where locals chat drink beer play guitar and smoke beneath the burly statue of Adamastor the storm battling giant in Portuguese poet Luís de Camões epic poem Os Lusíadas The city views here at cafe Noobai are beautiful at this time of day although the bartender tells me they re even better in the purple haze of sunset Heading for the hills Lisbon s hills have made fairground rides out of its public transport Bee yellow vintage trams including the famous tram which rumbles through much of the historic centre roller coaster along the streets while elevadores funiculars buzz up the steepest inclines just as they have for more than a century In downtown Baixa Lisbon s only street lift the neo gothic Elevador de Santa Justa designed by Raul Mésnier Gustave Eiffel s protégé presents passengers with degree views of the skyline Much newer on the scene is Lisbon s fleet of tuk tuks Your limo has arrived chuckles Eduardo Carvalho of Tuk Tuk Tejo the next morning He s a fast talking passionate man with a broad grin and a jumper that matches his sky blue open sided tuk tuk which I hop into Lisbon is mountainous but compact and the cobbles can be slippery many struggle to walk here Eduardo says Electric tuk tuks arrived in the city years ago and initially taxi drivers and cars overtook us impatiently they thought we were just a fad But now we ve been accepted We trundle up to the pine shaded Miradouro Senhora do Monte Lisbon s highest viewpoint where the wide angle vistas reveal the city in all its multi tiered glory sweeping from the castle across the river to Cristo Rei a late tribute to Rio de Janeiro s Christ the Redeemer and beyond to the forested mountains of Sintra I recognise the historic centre fading where the skyscrapers of modern Lisbon sprout up Tuk tuks let you see all the detail without the uphill slog and crowds We can get to the places trams and taxis can t fill you in on the history show you secret spots shouts Eduardo as we rattle through the noisy Alcântara docks For a glimpse of old school Lisbon pop into a cubby hole ginjinha sour cherry liqueur bar Most famous of the lot is A Ginjinha on Largo de São Domingos going strong since Order your ginjinha with or without cherry Photograph by Mark Parren Taylor He suddenly swings around a corner to one of these secret spots puttering up a boneshaker of a hill to Miradouro de Santo Amaro where a wizened Renaissance chapel has withered like the year old olive trees surrounding it But it s the Ponte de Abril leaping boldly across the Tagus that fills the frame Completed in the suspension bridge is the spitting image of San Francisco s Golden Gate Bridge And as staggering as the view is we re the only ones here it s silent but for the distant roar of traffic and the gulls wheeling on the breeze Nice huh says Eduardo with a smile more to himself than to me seemingly lost in his own thoughts I nod and trace the line of the hills with my hand down to the sunlit river which in turn drifts to the deep blue of the Atlantic
