Caribbean Photograph by Helmut Corneli Alamy Stock Photo TRAVEL This tiny island is the best place to dive in the Caribbean From shipwrecks to unspoiled nature travelers find treasures all around St Eustatius By Julia Eskins August min read History is being recovered above and below the waterline on a little known Dutch Caribbean island With a marine park larger than the island itself St Eustatius or Statia to the people who live here is one of the best diving destinations in the region Located just five miles northwest of popular St Kitts the island has more protected historical sites underwater and on land per square mile than anywhere else in the Caribbean The Quill rises on the south side of St Eustatius The dormant volcano sits in Quill Boven National Park one of three protected areas on the square mile island Photograph by MAURICIO HANDLER Nat Geo Image Collection On land St Eustatius blooms with nature Ringing the volcanic island are rocky coastlines lined with inky black sand beaches forming important nesting sites for endangered sea turtles To the south the Quill Boven National Park makes a haven for rare birds including the red billed tropicbird and habitat to types of orchids Crowning the island is the Quill a dormant volcano at the center of eight hiking trails including one that treks into the forested crater Here s what travelers need to know to explore this often overlooked historical and natural wonderland Zoom in to see more sites in St Eustatius Dive into history In the century St Eustatius was a free port making it one of the Atlantic s busiest and a major hub for the slave trade the island was colonized by the Dutch in the early century At its peak more than ships dropped anchor in the harbor annually The island s economic success allowed it to supply the United States with ammunition during the American Revolutionary War a secret act of allyship revealed with the arrival of the American brig the Andrew Doria in late When the ship sailed into the harbor carrying a copy of the Declaration of Independence Statia greeted it with an official gun salute making the Dutch the first to recognize America s independence The act capped longstanding tensions between the British and the Dutch leading to the fourth Anglo Dutch war Since then the first salute has been celebrated in St Eustatius with a reenactment every November

Corneli Alamy Stock Photo Today vestiges of Statia s past fuel the dive spots in St Eustatius National Marine Park which encircles the island One highlight within this sanctuary is Anchor Point a coral covered French anchor dating back to around which is hidden behind giant barrel sponges and reef walls packed with lobster s and schools of fish off the southwest coast of the island Nearby is the Charles L Brown Wreck a cable laying ship from and one of the largest underwater ruins in the Caribbean How do we find shipwrecks and who owns them From historical sources such as old newspaper articles and government correspondence we know hundreds of ships wrecked all around the island in colonial times says Ruud Stelten an archaeologist and director of the Shipwreck Survey an underwater archaeological field school that aims to document and preserve shipwrecks sites to better understand the island s maritime history We ve only found a few of them so far In hurricanes Irma and Maria exposed the remnants of an century vessel now called Triple Wreck or SE which Stelten s organization has been studying with the St Eustatius Center for Archaeological Research The team is aiming to find and preserve artifacts to help researchers better understand the island s history Anyone with a diving certification can join the study which sets out twice a year and explores other wreck sites around the island Tokens from the past This photo shows a necklace made of blue beads artifacts found in high concentrations in St Eustatius Photograph by Horizons WWP Alamy Stock Photo By law divers are not allowed to take artifacts home except for one thing blue beads These cobalt tokens are scattered throughout the marine park and on St Eustatius Blue Bead Hole is a particularly popular dive site Researchers say that the beads were spun in glass factories in the Netherlands and shipped to St Eustatius and possibly other nearby islands where they were used as a form of currency for trading goods and to signify rank among the enslaved people According to local lore when slavery was abolished in the newly emancipated threw the beads into the ocean in celebration However studies suggest that a ship carrying beads could have sunk near the island causing the beads to collect in one location Regardless their cultural importance lives on through Statia s oral history Blue beads are my favorite artifact and I often wear them with great pride as they make me feel more connected to my ancestors says Misha Spanner a guide at the St Eustatius Historical Foundation Museum When a blue bead is found most locals consider it lucky The search for lost slave ships led this diver on an extraordinary journey Statia s history of enslavement is being excavated on land too In archaeologists discovered an century burial ground and an indigo vat on the site of the new Golden Rock Dive Nature Resort a former plantation The vat was likely used by enslaved people to produce the prized azure hue in dyeing fabric In another burial ground dating to the century was discovered at the former Golden Rock Plantation Archaeologists excavate the century Golden Rock plantation in Oranjestad St Eustatius where human skeletons were found on May Photograph by Tim van Dijk AP Photo These new findings are inspiring a holistic approach to learning about Statia s slave history with involvement from the local community says Gay Soetekouw president of the St Eustatius Center for Archaeological Research The hope is that such an approach will shed more light on a population whose personal stories were never documented Caribbean conservation Besides history preserving the island s natural areas is a priority St Eustatius National Parks encourages travelers to learn about the island s flora and fauna via guided nature hikes and volunteer science projects through its three protected areas the marine sanctuary Quill Boven National Park and the Miriam C Schmidt Botanical Garden One such program gathered community helpers to monitor turtle nesting sites on Zeelandia Beach research whale and dolphin routes and identify manta rays Another focused on reforestation both on and off shore with recruits planting native species such as gum trees and sea grapes both of which contribute to biodiversity and hurricane protection We are blessed to have this nature still intact says hiking guide Celford Gibbs When you look at a place like St Maarten and the other Leeward Islands booming with tourism hotels and casinos you realize we re behind them in terms of development But it s a good position because we can learn from their mistakes Here s how you can help mitigate the effects of overtourism As Statia looks to its future Gibbs says there s growing interest in ensuring tourism benefits local communities and ecosystems That means preserving the island s cultural heritage as much as its natural gifts On a recent walk Gibbs forages for bitterroot to make a medicinal tea and expounds on the dental benefits of gum tree leaves his activity stems from ancestral knowledge As one of only three local guides he says that sharing this handed down insight with youth and travelers is essential to the island s future Once people get a taste for nature he says they always come back for more Julia Eskins is a Toronto based writer who covers travel design and wellness
