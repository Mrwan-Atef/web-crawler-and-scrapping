Share A pedestrianized street in Oaxaca City Follow our tips to get the most of your next trip to Mexico Kelli Hayden Shutterstock I grew up in a Mexican household in the heart of American suburbia one of those kids who ping ponged across the border as a kid I spent my summers in Mexico as comfortable on janky city buses as I was body surfing on white capped waves Adulthood meant more of the same â but instead of mere months every summer I passed entire years All these years later Iâ m still awed by Mexicoâ s scale and diversity its showcase of unique landscapes flavors music and art Yet despite the countryâ s vast scope and regional differences I always see the themes that bind Mexicans together everywhere social customs and cultural mores safety concerns and travel preferences With this in mind here are a few tips to your upcoming trip to Mexico a little easier â no matter where youâ re lucky enough to be going Book early and budget extra for the high season Mexico is a popular destination year round â though Christmas New Year s spring break and July see an uptick in travelers both foreign and domestic Expect higher prices for accommodation excursions car rentals and even airfare sometimes even double the norm Hotels also fill up fast â so book early especially on the coasts where Mexicans tend to spend their vacations Left A woman on a beach in Isla Holbox Mexico Dallas Stribley Getty Images Right Climbers near the snowy summit of Pico de Orizaba Mexico Laura Jacome Shutterstock Pack for the climate Mexico is a vast multi climate country with destinations ranging from frosty dawns at to balmy sunsets at sea level Research your destinationâ s weather carefully so you know what to expect and how to pack for you may need a bikini or umbrella or winter jacket or all three Remember that Mexico sits squarely in the hurricane belt with its coasts susceptible to big storms from June to November Bring sunscreen and mosquito repellent with you If youâ ll need sunscreen or mosquito repellent and we recommend both bring it from home While such products are widely available in Mexico the options are limited and expensive A young passenger on a bus in Palenque Long distance buses are a great way to get around Mexicoâ s vast distances Jon Davison for Lonely Planet Embrace long distance bus travel Unless you need a car we recommend long distance buses for exploring Mexico Countless bus companies crisscross the country providing reliable and efficient transport Always opt for primera clase first class service which is only slightly more expensive than segunda clase second class â yet much faster and vastly more comfortable thanks to cushy reclining seats individual screens wi fi and even snacks Use your ATM card Though itâ s good practice to bring some cash in case of an emergency say if you lose your wallet thereâ s no need to bring cash to exchange Instead use Mexican ATMs which are ubiquitous in all but the smallest of towns and the most economical way to get pesos The best way to stay connected Saily provides a hassle free solution to travel data â just choose your data plan and prepare for your trip When you get to your destination you can go online right away Get your eSIM But pay attention to those ATM transaction fees If theyâ re more than US per withdrawal use a different bankâ s machine BBVA Bancomer and Santander tend to have the lowest fees Also if the ATM prompts you to accept a â specialâ exchange rate decline it Youâ ll still be able to withdraw pesos only the bank will apply the official exchange rate which is always to your advantage Polite greetings are a sign of respect in Mexico Thomas Barwick Getty Images Say hello â even to passersby Mexicans deeply value pleasantries â for theyâ re a sign of respect Saying â buenos dias â good morning or â buenas tardes â good afternoon when entering a room or a business is typical When leaving a quick â con permiso â excuse me is considered polite And when meeting a person for the first time a handshake with a â mucho gusto â a great pleasure is the go to If you know the person a kiss on the cheek or a hug is expected Leave your bling at home Avoid bringing flashy watches and jewelry to Mexico If you wear such accessories youâ ll risk standing out and becoming a target for pickpockets and scammers Likewise resist renting a luxury car which is more likely to be broken into or stopped by officials Tip almost everyone Tipping is an important source of income for most workers in Mexico from the kid who â watchesâ your parked car to the concierge who provides specialized services In general tip to for waiters and tour guides US to US per day for hotel housekeepers US to US per bag for porters and US to US for parking attendants grocery baggers and gas station attendants Taxi drivers donâ t expect tips but certainly welcome them An outdoor market in MÃ rida Bargain with vendors gently â and always bring cash Focus Photography Shutterstock Bargain with kindness Haggling is a core component of shopping in Mexico especially in markets and at street side stands Indeed prices are often slightly inflated with that expectation Yet be mindful of how hard a bargain you drive those extra few pesos will likely mean a lot more to the vendor than to you Carry small bills and coins While credit cards are becoming increasingly common Mexico remains a predominantly cash economy so be sure to carry pesos in your pocket whenever youâ re out and about The smaller the denomination the better â for despite the ubiquity of cash change is often scarce Youâ ll either be left waiting for the vendor to break a bill â or worse be turned away Opt for rideshares Mexican taxi drivers are notorious for scamming tourists inflating their rates or rerouting passengers to locales where they can collect commissions When possible opt for a rideshare such as Uber which has reliable service at rates that are often cheaper than taxis If you must use a cab agree on a price before you step into the vehicle Be sure to ask respectfully before you take a photo of anyone especially those in Indigenous dress Katja Tsvetkova Shutterstock Take photographs with respect No one likes a stranger suddenly aiming a camera at their face and taking a photo This certainly applies to Mexicans including and especially Indigenous Mexicans who all too often attract the notice of foreign shutterbugs because of their traditional clothing Instead of quickly snapping a photo approach the person and ask permission first In marketplaces or for street vendors buy something and then ask this tends to grease the wheels Avoid places where things can go wrong fast With so much news about cartel violence in Mexico safety is a common and understandable concern Generally violent crime involves a cartel versus a cartel with tourists highly infrequent targets Still itâ s always possible to find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time To play it safe steer clear of drugs either buying them using them or being around people who are partaking of them and avoid fringe neighborhoods If youâ re traveling in cartel hotbeds such as Sonora or MichoacÃ n turn in early travel by day and stick to toll roads Stay alert to petty theft When tourists experience crime in Mexico itâ s typically of the petty theft variety As in most places around the world itâ s just an unfortunately fact of life here Keep aware of your surroundings especially in crowded places like markets or city buses where pickpockets tend to strike Leave your jewelry at home â and avoid displaying large sums of cash as well â for youâ ll risk standing out and becoming a target for thieves and scammers Wearing clothes with deep or zippered pockets also helps If your hotel room doesnâ t have a safe lock your valuables in your luggage those little TSA locks are real deterrents Likewise resist renting a flashy car and drawing too much attention to yourself Donâ t drink the water Itâ s true what they say just donâ t drink the water in Mexico or even brush your teeth with it While tap water is purified at the source all over the country it picks up contaminants as it travels through pipes Instead stick to bottled water at all times Note that you donâ t have to worry about ice at most restaurants and bars as itâ s made from purified water at commercial factories Chefs prepare tacos at a stall in Mexico City Street food is a highlight of any trip anywhere in Mexico Shutterstock Do dig in to street food Eating street food â sizzling tacos elote grilled corn in a cup sweet and crunchy marquesitas sweet crÃªpes â is one of those Mexican must dos Seek out stands with a crowd taking cues from locals about safe to eat at spots Yet always take a hard pass on the extras like mayo and cream which often sit in the sun unrefrigerated for hours creating a perfect breeding ground for bacteria Reach out to your embassy If youâ re a victim of crime or need medical assistance or legal help contact your embassy or consulate Almost countries including the USA and Canada have representatives in Mexico to help you navigate problems while youâ re in the country Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Mexico Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers
