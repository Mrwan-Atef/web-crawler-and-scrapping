I ve skied in ski resorts these are the best TRAVEL I ve skied in ski resorts these are the best Over the past years while working as a ski journalist I ve been fortunate enough to visit around resorts And my pick of the best will surprise you Over the course of a year career as a ski journalist Alf Alderson has found the best ski resorts in the world Photograph by Hugh Rhodes By Alf Alderson February This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK No two ski resorts are the same Of course some are better than others but often it s not always the best known the likes of Val d Isère St Moritz or St Anton that are actually the best to ski in I ve discovered this over the course of a year career as a ski journalist a fantastic job that has taken me to around ski resorts on every continent other than Antarctica where yes you can ski on backcountry tours The highs have included skiing on active volcanoes in Russia s Kamchatka Peninsula and down to the Greenland Sea on Iceland s Troll Peninsula The lows Being emergency helicoptered off the Cul du Nant glacier above La Plagne and riding down the mountain in a blood bucket ski patrol stretcher at Kicking Horse British Columbia ACL injuries the skier s curse to blame both times My favourite ski resorts tend to be small little known places such as the US s Brundage Mountain Idaho see below Canada s Castle Mountain in Alberta and Riksgransen Sweden where the corporate giants haven t taken over and the character and individuality of the locale is a big part of the ski experience But there s no doubt that European mega resorts like Verbier Kitzbühel and the Three Valleys are hard to beat when it comes to providing great skiing for everyone Ski expert Alf Alderson has skied on every continent apart from Antarctica Photograph by Alf Alderson Here s my pick of the best Whatever you think of my choices it s probably true to say that when the powder lies deep and the sun shines brightly most ski resorts offer a superlative experience however big or small Best for beginners La Plagne France If it s your first time on skis you can t go wrong with La Plagne Each of the separate villages that makes up this resort in southeastern France has at least one lift that s free doesn t require those costly lift passes and there s a good selection of ski schools with English speaking instructors La Plagne is high enough to be snow sure it s easy to access from the UK and once you ve built up some confidence on the nursery slopes you can advance to a superb array of cruisy blue runs Add to this a fine selection of accommodation to suit all budgets plenty of lively bars and restaurants plus lots to do if you fancy a break from skiing bobsleighing anyone and La Plagne is the ideal place in which to get bitten by the ski bug Why La Plagne ski resort in France is also an off piste haven Best for intermediates Cervinia Italy If you re looking for an array of seemingly endless effortless runs to cruise down Cervinia is hard to beat almost of the slopes here are graded either blue or red and their smooth well groomed terrain will make you feel like a world class skier Even better Cervinia s south facing orientation means it s bathed in sunshine for much of the day while its altitude slopes rise from to a whopping meaning that its abundant snowfall sticks around And then there s its truly spectacular setting beneath the Matterhorn plus the fact that you can also access the linked resort of Zermatt in neighbouring Switzerland all of which makes Cervinia a winner with intermediate skiers How Laax in Switzerland brings a California surfer vibe to the slopes Best for experts Red Mountain Canada I visited Red Mountain on my first ever ski press trip and I ve since been back more times than I can remember yet I still get lost here This isn t because I m a hopeless map reader it s simply that with so many routes through the resort s legendary tree runs it s impossible to remember them all By European standards Red Mountain in British Columbia is small with only a handful of lifts and just of vertical but that small package comes crammed with steeps glades and powder bowls to challenge the best And there s the thrilling option of cat skiing riding a caterpillar tracked vehicle up adjacent Mount Kirkup to ski down untracked terrain all for just C a ride And it has the kind of effortlessly laid back vibe exhibited by only the coolest ski resorts Visit once and like me you ll be back time and again Purpose built Les Arcs was first opened in and has continued to expand until Photograph by Getty Images Best all rounder Les Arcs France Reliable purpose built Les Arcs may seem a rather prosaic choice as the best all rounder but if you want guaranteed snow world class skiing for all abilities a good variety of accommodation bars and restaurants along with easy access by train plane or car it s hard to beat And it s nice to know that you don t necessarily have to travel to North America or Japan or spend a fortune to enjoy some of the best skiing in the world Should you decide Les Arcs doesn t meet all your requirements which is unlikely the resort is linked to neighbouring La Plagne to form Paradiski one of the world s biggest ski areas You re also within a short drive of La Rosiere St Foy Tignes and Val d Isère surely enough choice and variety for anyone Just one tip don t visit during half term when peak season crowds make skiing a nightmare which is true of Les Arcs and all of its satellite resorts Best for non skiers Cortina d Ampezzo Italy Cortina has been attracting both skiers and non skiers since the Winter Olympics were held here in And this year seven decades later it hosts the games again which will see everyone from Olympians to designer draped fashionistas wandering the pretty streets of the so called Pearl of the Dolomites Soaring above the town on all four sides those Dolomite mountains turn pastel pink in the evening sunlight and while they re the star attraction the wealth of high end shops selling everything from Rolex watches to yachts and motorboats and numerous great restaurants taking in several Michelin starred tasting menus certainly add to the allure The cobbled car free Corsa Italia is the place where the beautiful people gather There are also winter walking paths ice skating and day trips to nearby Venice And as those Olympians will attest the skiing is excellent too Sitting at feet Livigno in the Italian Alps is Europe s highest inhabited parish Photograph by Getty Images Best value Livigno Italy Europe s highest inhabited parish Livigno sits at in the Italian Alps virtually guaranteeing good snow It offers a wide range of great value accommodation bars and restaurants plus lift tickets can be had for less than a day if you visit during low season December and April As for the skiing there s a large and varied mix of slopes for all abilities Great marketing by resorts such as Aspen and Whistler means that places like Livigno are often overshadowed But it doesn t necessarily make them better in four visits to Whistler for instance I m yet to encounter anything other than slush ice or rain on the slopes This along with enormous lift queues and lift tickets priced at up to a day Aspen is a staggering per day makes me wonder what the big attraction is Why Eastern Europe should be your next ski destination Best ski resort you ve never heard of Brundage Mountain US Deep powder immense backcountry immaculately groomed slopes and zero lift queues This is what you ll find at Idaho s Brundage Mountain a resort set nine miles north of the attractive little town of McCall set beautifully on the shores of Payette Lake in central Idaho Brundage has just six ski lifts but they access up to of vertical encompassing everything from open powder fields to runs through perfectly spaced trees plus almost deserted groomed pistes even during the US ski season s busiest weeks including Christmas New Year s Day Martin Luther King Jr Day and Presidents Day It also offers you the American West in all its glory with summit panoramas that take in the wild and evocatively named Salmon River Mountains Gospel Hump Mountains Wallowa Mountains and Seven Devils Brundage is marketed rather poetically as having the best snow in Idaho and it s lived up to that claim on each of my three visits in fact it might even have the best snow in the US but that wouldn t rhyme Best luxury destination Lyngen Alps Norway Luxury means different things to different people and schlepping up from sea level to the summit of Vanntinden in the Lyngen Alps on touring skis isn t what many would call a luxury experience But if you re lucky as you hit the summit you may get to watch the sun dipping down over the Norwegian Sea in a blaze of orange before you ski back down to sea level in the dusky light with a handful of fellow adventurers on slopes totally bereft of any other skiers One for experienced backcountry skiers select tours in the Lyngen Alps will then have you hop aboard a well appointed catamaran for a nighttime sail across the fjords perhaps seeing the Northern Lights ready to ascend and descend another deserted mountain the following day And hard work or not it will all definitely meet one of the Cambridge Dictionary s definitions of luxury as something that gives you a lot of pleasure but cannot be done often Take a ski safari across the Dolomites before the Winter Olympics To subscribe to National Geographic Traveller UK magazine click here Available in
