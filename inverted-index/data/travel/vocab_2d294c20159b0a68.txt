Lindia in the Acropolis of Lindos Shutterstock The largest island of the Dodecanese Rhodes is a perfect place to start any island hopping adventure whatever your interest Get lost in the riot of medieval alleyways and the fortified and UNESCO World Heritage Site of Rhodes Old Town Once youâ ve â escapedâ the Old Town walls go further afield to ancient ruins beaches and seaside resorts For lesser known experiences and fewer people explore the islandâ s vineyard region and itÊ s wineries devour local cuisine in one of Rhodesâ more remote inland settlements and wander through Italian style villages and their extraordinary past When should I go to Rhodes Rhodes is â open for businessâ between April and September That said as the administrative center for the Dodecanese and a gateway to other islands Rhodes Town particularly New Town operates year round High season June to August brings sun crowds and numerous religious celebrations May sees fewer visitors and lower prices as does September which is also perfect because the ocean remains warm enough for swimming Spring and fall are perfect for hiking Advertisement A diving board at Elli Beach in Rhodes Town Liya Blumesser Shutterstock How much time should I spend in Rhodes While youÊ d leave happy after a week in Rhodes many visitors stop here for one or two days only as part of an island hopping expedition If thatâ s the case on your first day stick to Rhodes Old Town and its captivating sites Allow another two days to explore some of the island venture inland visit the wineries or plunge into the superb seas off of one of the islandâ s many beaches Is it easy to get in and around Rhodes There are two ways to arrive in Rhodes The first Diagoras Airport miles southwest of the city is well connected with other major Greek cities and islands A handy local bus connects the airport and Rhodes Old Town The second is by ferry services connect Rhodes with many islands The island is serviced by two local bus companies â KTEL for the east coast and RODA for the west coast Visitors traveling on a tight schedule may need to consider taxis and car hire The busy Evreon Martyron Square is located in the Jewish Quarter of Rhodes Old Town Creatikon Studio Shutterstock Top things to do in Rhodes Play out your inner knight in the Old Town Located at the islandâ s northern tip the extraordinary walled area that comprises Rhodes Old Town feels like another realm thanks to its distinctive mixture of Byzantine Turkish and Italian buildings and monuments The best way to view the Old Town is on a mile stroll Start at the Dâ Amboise Gate one of nine gates then continue through the Knightsâ Quarter The mansions inns along this stretch were organized by the medieval Knights of St John in the century and housed knights of specific nationalities Next visit the Palace of the Grand Master a mind boggling century castle erected by the Knights Hospitaller Donâ t miss the Archaeological Museum housed within the century Knightsâ Hospital Then make your way to the major visitor magnet â the Turkish Quarter Hora the maze of charming twisting bougainvillea laden alleyways Donâ t let the chaos distract you from spotting the many fascinating derelict mosques and Muslim monuments Be sure to pass the pink domed Mosque of SuÌ leyman and opposite this the Muslim Library The Old Townâ s east corner a group of narrow alleys makes up the Jewish Quarter Tragically most of its inhabitants were killed during WWII Eat with and like the locals at Rodies A family run restaurant called Rodies located just beyond the walls of the Old Town is loved by locals and visitors alike so mingling here over a traditional dish or three is particularly fun Rodia means pomegranate tree named after the four pomegranates filling the pretty outdoor courtyard The local cuisine will catch your eye and taste buds â popular and traditional Greek dishes as well as a few of the familyÊ s creations Start with a Rodies salad a mix of lettuce roasted sesame and Greek talagani cheese before selecting from a varied range of mezedes share plates that include the local specialty pitaroudia chickpea fritters kleftiko stew slow cooked lamb baked in a clay pot and baked aubergine eggplant rolls The word is out about this place it gets busy so go early or with a calm attitude Itâ s worth any wait Planning tip Rodies doesn t have a website This is very much a word of mouth restaurant If you need directions you ll find them here Advertisement Tourists in the Valley of Butterflies Jaroslav Moravcik Shutterstock Balm your soul in the islandâ s interior If you have the time and inclination donâ t miss the islandâ s hilly interior This delightfully subdued area has nature backed beaches tranquil forest settlements impressive castles and excellent tavernas Head first to Butterflies Valley to immerse yourself among lush flora the chirps of cicadas and the beat of butterflies After your fluttery fill head to the abandoned village of Eleousa and its former sanitarium note if you travel north you pass Triantafillou Winery en route see below Eleousa â a replica of a village in the Italian Alps â was one of four constructed on the island under the orders of Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini who keen to spread his influence Italianized many villages around the Dodecanese While exploring youâ re guaranteed to sense the ghosts of laborers â Italian lumberjacks â along with tuberculosis patients of the former Sanitarium that operated after WWII Continue west another miles to Saint Nikolaos Fountoukli one of many quaint Byzantine churches Explore grape country and sample traditional wines Wine growing locals here are in the viticulture â know â which is hardly surprising given that the island has been producing wine since the century BCE Explore the islandâ s verdant wine hub around Mt Attavyros and try the local varieties such as Amorgiano Athiri and two Muscats â the di Trani and small berried A number of wineries offer tastings including Triantafillou Winery Kounakis Winery Alexandris Winery and Emery cleverly named after the Grand Master of the Knights of St John St Anthony s Gate in Rhodes Old Town with the round tower of St Mary Shutterstock My favorite thing to do in Rhodes I donâ t know if itâ s thanks to my â inner medieval knightâ but I get a thrill strolling along the ramparts of the year old fortifications of the Old City between the Palace of the Grand Master and St Johnâ s Gate Viewing the domes minarets surrounding moat and bougainvillea filled lush gardens takes you into a historical realm its sheer scale puts a human being in literal perspective Part of the route follows the dry moat leading to the realization that this follows in the spectral footsteps of previous invaders â Romans Knights of St John Ottomans and Italians How much money do I need for Rhodes For a comfortable stay in decent accommodations in the New Town prices in the Old Town are double dining in mid range tavernas plus an activity or two budget roughly â to â US to US per day Outside of July and August high season prices drop significantly As with all islands goods must be shipped or flown to Rhodes As such prices for some things such as groceries or items valued by travelers and not necessarily by Greeks can be at least be priced the same as in a European city However great value for money meals and local produce make up for this Â Hostel room in Rhodes from â US Â Basic moderate room for two â to â US to US Â Self catering apartment including Airbnb â and above US and above Â Public transport ticket â to â US to US Â Coffee â to â US to US Â Gyros â to â US to US Â Dinner for two at a village taverna from â US Â Beer pint at the bar â US Â Pitaroudia savory fritters â US Â Melekouni sweet â US Anthony Quinn Bay located on the island s east coast Shutterstock What are the best beaches in Rhodes This million dollar question is tricky to answer Itâ s like asking a Greek grandmother who makes the familyâ s best moussaka Compose your wish list sand shade nature facilities family friendly windsurfing etc Then ask locals and other travelers for their opinions That said itâ s worth knowing that beaches on the west coast tend to be pebbly while those on the east coast are sandy And high season brings crowds wherever you are such as on Lindos Beach thatâ s overshadowed by the amazing acropolis The most remote and my favorite is the beautiful Prasonisi Beach because of the breezes there it is also popular with wind and kite surfers Can I drink the water in Rhodes Unlike many of the other islands tap water on Rhodes is considered safe to drink though bottled water is available throughout and often favored by the locals too Plastic waste on the islands is an issue however so consider bringing a filtration kit As in the rest of Greece water is a precious commodity thatâ s put under enormous pressure during high season in particular What is the Green or Climate Tax Formerly called the tourist or accommodation tax a so called green tax exists in Rhodes indeed throughout Greece Factor roughly â to â per person per night on a sliding scale depending on the star rating of your hotel A shopping street in the Turkish quarter of Rhodes Old Town Jaroslav Moravcik Shutterstock Should I carry cash A card What is the tipping culture Apple Pay is popular and cards are king shops and services are equipped with POS point of sale That said always keep cash and coins for small purchases at markets and villages and for public transport and tips On that note Greeks generally round up for say coffee and a snack or leave a few euros for a mid priced meal unlike the US thereâ s no strict percentage calculated How do taxi fees operate Taxis cover many of the main sites and beaches Prices are displayed outside the main taxi rank outside the Old Town Advertisement Advertisement
