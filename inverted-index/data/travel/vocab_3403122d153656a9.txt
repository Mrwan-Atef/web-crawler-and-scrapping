Love Burning Man This Santa Fe fire festival is a Labor Day staple TRAVEL HERE NOT THERE Burning Man not your style Try this fiery Santa Fe festival instead The Zozobra festival turns this year and it s a family friendly party that lets you put fears anxieties and even parking tickets to the torch Instead of heading to the Burning Man festival for Labor Day weekend revelers should consider celebrating at the lesser known family friendly Zozobra festival in Santa Fe New Mexico Photograph by K D Leperi Alamy Stock Photo By Andrew Nelson August Each Labor Day weekend a communal event unfolds in the American West centered around the nighttime burning of a giant effigy Amid chants and music the towering figure is consumed by fire toppling to the ground in a shower of flames and sparks Most people will think of Burning Man in the northern Nevada desert and its RV army filled with Silicon Valley executives in bodypaint and loincloths With slow ticket sales this year the gathering at Black Rock isn t the only Western fire festival that weekend Nor was it the first The history of Zozobra Over the same end of summer three day holiday another older conflagration unfolds in New Mexico Marking a century this year Santa Fe s fiery Zozobra festival rivals the better known technopalooza offering a similar vibrant atmosphere communal spirit and a familiar transformative finale of fire Like its Bay Area counterpart the Zozobra festival was invented by bohemian visionaries In Pennsylvania painter William Howard Will Shuster Jr created an effigy as the highlight for a party hosted by a collection of artists known as Los Cinco Pintores It was part of a larger group of mostly Anglo painters including Georgia O Keefe drawn to Santa Fe for its colorful landscapes and a culture marked by Mexican and Native American influences Shuster drew inspiration for his totem from Mexico s Yaqui Indians and their Easter Holy Week tradition where an effigy of Judas is paraded and burned The painter named his foot tall puppet Zozobra a Spanish word meaning anguish or gloom Its burning symbolized the destruction of worrisome or negative feelings Now feet six inches tall and constructed of wire wood and cloth Zozobra has become deeply intertwined with Santa Fe s identity The effigy s burning on the Friday night before Labor Day marks the start of the Fiesta de Santa Fé the city s annual year old celebration of art culture and heritage Celebrating a century old tradition This community focus is what s different between Zozobra and Burning Man Zozobra is a tradition here says New Mexico History Museum Curator Hannah Abelbeck Zozobra wouldn t exist unless Santa Fe cared about it and invested in it To commemorate the festival s birthday Abelbeck s museum located in downtown Santa Fe has opened a new two year long exhibition that explores Zozobra s roots and cultural influences The New Mexico Museum of Art on the city s famed Plaza will also host a special exhibit about the tradition Santa Fe will hold other distinctive commemorations including a Zozobra inspired hot air balloon debuting August and public art devoted to the effigy Casting fears into the fire As always in the weeks prior to Zozobra s burning residents dutifully write down their fears and anxieties on slips of paper and drop them into boxes scattered across town These are collected and their contents stuffed inside the puppet adding additional fuel for the fire Sometimes citizens consign other totems of distress mortgage papers hospital gowns speeding tickets and divorce to the flames A crowd of people is expected to converge on Fort Marcy a local park that s a five minute drive from Santa Fe s Central Plaza to watch the spectacle People pass the time by consuming refreshments or tossing beach balls while Zozobra raises his arms and growls at the crowd as accompanying musical acts dance performances and storytelling underscore the city s rich artistic traditions As night falls Zozobra s nemesis the dancing Fire Spirit appears Armed with two torches she ignites the flammable giant To chants of Burn Him Old Man Gloom as he is called is consumed by
