How urban foraging became the new way to explore a city TRAVEL How urban foraging became the new way to explore a city Can t travel far Then travel deep to find nourishment in your everyday surroundings Wross Lawrence a professional forager collects mugwort at a park in East London The plant has an aroma similar to sage and can be found growing throughout summer Photographs by MARCO KESSELER By Wross Lawrence May min read For travelers stuck at home the world is a wonder to contemplate alas from afar But one of the key goals of sustainable travel to eat local with a mitigated environmental impact might not require much more than a walk around the block Urban foraging is an intimate study and interaction with the living world around us singling out a flower or a berry learning its name and properties what it tastes like when and where it grows how to cook with it or preserve it Long prized for its medicinal properties mallow also works as a thickening agent and was the original ingredient of the marshmallow With a taste slightly like apple and a high pectin content hawthorn berries are excellent for making jams and condiments Foraged foods are increasingly visible In the fine dining world chefs have been crafting menus that are not only sourced locally from agricultural producers but in some cases sourced in the regions around a restaurant There s an appetite for it According to a new Morning Consult National Geographic poll a third of Americans especially those ages say they are preparing more meatless meals because of higher prices and limited meat options at grocery stores Related Will the sustainable travel movement survive coronavirus Travelers have likewise been turning to foraging as a way to experience a destination with guided tours growing in popularity No Taste Like Home a year old foraging ecotour company based in the Appalachian town of Asheville North Carolina offers guided experiences for modern hunter gatherers Some of the collected bounty can then be savored at a local restaurant Foraging fundamentals With scientists estimating that we ll need to feed two billion more people by the question of which diet is best has taken on new urgency The foods we choose to eat in the coming decades will have dramatic consequences for the planet Instead of looking to futuristic solutions we might try looking to the past Before agriculture was established foraging helped feed our ancestors and heal their ailments As a result researchers are increasing efforts to learn what they can about foraging cultures such as the Tsimane in the Amazon and the Hadza in Tanzania before this way of life disappears Lawrence forages wild food for Michelin starred restaurants markets breweries and supermarkets in London I am now celebrating my year as a forager and I can tell you the yield is bountiful On my shelves at the moment are sloe gin infused with sloe berries a fruit of the blackthorn bush acorn schnapps elderflower cordial nettle pesto rosehip ice cream blackberry jam dried wild mushrooms and wild hop beer all homemade and hand picked from the streets parks and waterways of London Foragers in the U S find an equal bounty mulberry in Pennsylvania loquats and kumquats in California apples pears and plums in Wisconsin Foraging can be both superlative and extreme Florida based environmentalist Rob Greenfield for example spent a year foraging or growing everything he ate from grapefruit plucked from a neighboring tree to daikon radish cultivated in his own garden Related Explore photos of these beautiful Zen gardens The large citric petals of the magnolia can be pickled to yield the best flavor Rosehips the fruit of a rose plant are rich in vitamin C and can be used to make jam or herbal teas With its distinctive aroma Britain s wild garlic can be found carpeting the floor of woodland cemeteries and parks in springtime Photograph by Marco Kesseler I have not always spent my days rifling through hedgerows long grass backstreets and woodlands in search of wild food for Michelin starred restaurants markets breweries and supermarkets in London For many years I worked as a deep sea fisherman in my hometown of Tenby in southwest Wales But after years of getting up in the middle of the night to head out into the dark frigid Irish Sea I decided it was time for a change Back on land I trained and worked as a tree surgeon for three years which opened my eyes to all things wild and foraged In my opinion everybody should be able to experience the benefits of foraging especially now at a time when panic buyers often empty local supermarket shelves and stay at home orders limit travel Foraging connects us with nature in a way that is healing mentally and physically in times of stress and anxiety With fewer cars on the roads and people rushing past and less noise pollution now is the time to become more familiar with your natural environment The joy of simple acts Heading out on a forage you ll experience new smells tastes colors textures patterns and a satisfying sense of achievement It can be done by anyone almost anywhere and it doesn t cost a dime Wandering the streets you start to see new areas of the little nook in which your life takes place You notice things you used to walk past every day without acknowledgement now seeing them in a different light and discovering whole areas and communities you never knew existed before this new habit of meandering with purpose took ahold of you Related Here s how nature helps our brains I derive endless joy from this simple act and have found that it becomes involuntary and addictive once you start There is so much to learn and all of it surprising and interesting Take yarrow for example a plant that the Greek hero Achilles is said to have used to treat his soldiers wounds during the battle of Troy Or mallow a plant that a French confectioner used to create the world famous fireside treat in the Or a walnut tree which produces a hard shelled nut that people pay good money for at the grocers probably shipped in from overseas And it s dangling right there above your head A rowan tree the berries of which make a tasty jam grows outside an apartment block in East London If you do venture out without a guide be sure to triple check your finds with multiple sources and eat what you ve collected only if you re completely confident in your ID Useful guidebooks include Richard Mabey s Food for Free Why forage These plants are all high in nutrients vitamins and minerals far better for you than almost anything you will find at the store and without the pesticides They also serve medicinal purposes A few leaves of mullein a large hairy leafed plant that looks like sage on steroids produces a tea that soothes sore throats The bluish green needles of the white pine tree can be steeped in hot water and honey to make a cough syrup that alleviates chest congestion Wonder plants like these can be found growing all over cities and towns pushing out of the cracks in concrete climbing a park fence overhanging a cemetery gateway edging a waterway Once you begin to notice them you start to see them everywhere I believe foraging and botany should be introduced to us from an early age Growing up learning about all the different plant genera families and species sparks an interest and connects children to nature These children will grow into the architects bankers and politicians that will shape our cities and living environments in the future My worst fear is that when this pandemic crisis is over things will go back to normal even though normal wasn t working as the planet and its wildlife became secondary to economic and technologic priorities Perhaps during this period as we find ourselves keenly aware of our restricted access to the outdoors we ll take the time to think more about our vital relationship with the natural world Foraging no matter where you are is a good place to start
