County Meath Login Save Why you should go Newgrange is one of the most remarkable prehistoric sites in Europe famous for the illumination of its passage and tomb during the winter solstice sun Newgrange together with Dowth and Knowth are the three main Megalithic passage tombs that make the Brú na Bóinne Unesco World Heritage site The site is so ancient constructed about years ago that it predates Egypt s pyramids by some six centuries Winter Solstice It s magical to see it at any time of year but winter solstice weather permitting is incredibly special a bucket list event if you re lucky enough to nab a ticket At around on the winter solstice between December and the rising sun s rays shine through the roof box above the entrance creep slowly down the long passage and illuminate the tomb chamber for minutes There is little doubt that this is one of the country s most memorable even mystical experiences No matter when you visit there s a simulated winter sunrise for every group taken into the mound Newgrange lights up for winter solstice wieditmedia Getty Images History facts and legends Newgrange dates from around BC making it older than Stonehenge and the Great Pyramids of Giza No one is quite sure of Newgrange s original purpose it has been the subject of much archaeological debate over the years The most common theories are that it was a burial place for kings or a center for ritual The tomb s precise alignment with the sun at the time of the winter solstice suggests it was also designed to act as a calendar After being sealed for several millennia Newgrange was eventually rediscovered in when a local landowner began quarrying the mound for stones Over time Newgrange like Dowth and Knowth deteriorated and at one stage was even used as a quarry Archaeological excavations didn t begin until the The site was extensively restored in and again in Newgrange s name derives from New Granary the tomb did in fact serve as a repository for wheat and grain at one stage although a more popular belief is that it comes from the Irish for Cave of Gráinne a reference to a popular Celtic myth The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne tells of the illicit love between the woman betrothed to Fionn MacCumhaill or Finn McCool leader of the Fianna and Diarmuid one of his most trusted lieutenants When Diarmuid was fatally wounded his body was brought to Newgrange by the god Aengus in a vain attempt to save him and the despairing Gráinne followed him into the cave where she remained long after he died This suspiciously Arthurian tale substitute Lancelot and Guinevere for Diarmuid and Gráinne is undoubtedly a myth but it s still a pretty good story Newgrange also plays another role in Celtic mythology as the site where the hero Cúchulainn was conceived Aerial view of Newgrange MNStudio Shutterstock Inside Newgrange A startling in diameter and high Newgrange s white round stone walls topped by a grass dome look eerily futuristic despite its ancient origins Underneath the dome lies the Stone Age passage tomb A superbly carved kerbstone with double and triple spirals guards the tomb s main entrance but the area has been reconstructed so that visitors don t have to clamber in over it Above the entrance is a slit or roof box which lets light in Another beautifully decorated kerbstone stands at the exact opposite side of the mound Some experts say that a ring of standing stones encircled the mound forming a great circle about in diameter but only of these stones remain with traces of others below ground level Holding the whole structure together are the boulders of the kerb ring designed to stop the mound from collapsing outwards Eleven of these are decorated with motifs similar to those on the main entrance stone although only three have extensive carvings The white quartzite that encases the tomb was originally obtained from Wicklow south in an age before horse and wheel it was transported by sea and then up the River Boyne More than tonnes of earth and stone also went into the mound You can walk down the narrow passage lined with stone uprights some of them engraved which leads into the tomb chamber about one third of the way into the colossal mound The chamber has three recesses and in these are large basin stones that held cremated human bones As well as the remains the basins would have held funeral offerings of beads and pendants but these were stolen long before the archaeologists arrived Above the massive stones support a high corbel vaulted roof A complex drainage system means that not a drop of water has penetrated the interior in centuries Megalithic art at the entrance of Newgrange powerofforever Getty Images Tickets and other practicalities Brú na Bóinne Unesco World Heritage site in
