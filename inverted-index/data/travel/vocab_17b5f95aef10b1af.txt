Day trips from Seoul range from beaches to the ominous DMZ Â Getty Images So you re done with dynamic Seoul You re finished with its top fashion You re through with its cutting edge technology You can t listen to another K pop beat Well you re in luck Less than two hours away from the capital s ancient palaces and timeless temples are some super day trips From learning about Joseon history to visiting the DMZ the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea these are our favorites Advertisement Tourists visit the DMZ Â KIM JAE HWAN Contributor Getty Images The Demilitarized Zone DMZ Sitting between Seoul and North Korea Paju is the closest city to the Demilitarized Zone DMZ that divides the Korean peninsula At Panmunjom and the Joint Security Area JSA North and South Korean soldiers face each other across the military demarcation line The atmosphere is noticeably tense at this historically significant spot where important events such as the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement took place Since the end of the Korean War in authorities have uncovered four unfinished tunnels that North Korea built into South Korea Three are now accessible to visitors on guided tours The third tunnel is particularly popular and slightly unnerving because of its proximity to Seoul â it finishes just miles away from the capital Located miles from the military demarcation line Imjingak park acts as a gesture of hope for unification Built in it has many relics from the war on display including tanks and a destroyed train If you join a DMZ tour you ll be able to visit the Dora Observatory which offers clear views of North Korea including the city of Kaesong and the settlement of Gijeong dong The nickname of the latter propaganda village comes from claims that the pristine appearing settlement is actually uninhabited except for a handful of caretakers who occasionally flick lights on and off to simulate signs of life Many believe it exists simply to encourage South Koreans to defect for a better life across the border Near the observatory is Dorasan Station the northernmost station on South Korea s rail network To visit the DMZ including Panmunjom and infiltration tunnels you must join an official guided tour with an accompanying military escort but you can visit Imjingak independently How to get to the DMZ from Seoul Paju is miles northwest of Seoul and it s easily accessible by train from Yongsan Station with a journey time of one hour Buses also run to Paju from Seoul s northwestern districts Joseon history comes alive in Suwon s historic sites Â studiojh Getty Images Suwon The capital and largest city of Seoul s surrounding Gyeonggi Province Suwon is a popular day trip for its historic and cultural heritage sites The

is a must visit Advertisement Hidden within the fortress walls are Haenggung Palace and the royal residential quarters They were once used by royalty as a temporary home while traveling on royal business Though the Japanese colonial occupation destroyed much of the site restorers have largely rebuilt it offering a fascinating window into past royal life Feeling hungry Suwon is famous for its beef and the local galbi marinated ribs are a must try for carnivores Kabojung is one of the best spots to sample galbi â the government has recognized the owner as a Korean Food Grand Master Close to

fourth largest island this scenic spot offers plenty to see It has also served as the setting for many of Korea s most important historical events In the southern part of the island Jeondeung sa has the distinction of being Korea s oldest Buddhist temple dating back to CE The temple grounds sit within the ancient Samnang Fortress and the scenic surroundings present picture perfect views in all seasons Those interested in a more immersive experience can sign up for a Templestay program It s a moderate hike up some steep steps to reach the summit of Mani san Ganghwa do s highest peak but the surrounding views are memorable At the top is a sacred altar called Chamseongdan that Dangun the legendary founder of Korea is said to have used Another sacred spot on the island is the pretty Jeokseok sa Buddhist temple on the western side of Mt Goryeo san If all that hilltop hiking wears you out head to the Toga restaurant in the village of Heungwang ri close to the slopes of Mani san for a hearty bowl of tofu and salted shrimp stew made with the island s famous tiny shrimp The homemade tofu comes in a milky white broth that s only lightly seasoned by the shrimp but still deep in flavor How to get to Ganghwa do Ganghwa do is about miles northwest of Seoul Buses run from Seoul s Hapjeong Station in the west of the city to Ganghwa Terminal in just under two hours Namiseom Nami
