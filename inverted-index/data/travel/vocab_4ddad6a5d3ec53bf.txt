roam miles of lesser known trails tell the story of Hawai i Along a path used by ancient Hawaiians the mile trail to Ka ena Point on O ahu now follows a century railbed Photograph by Mauritius Images Alamy By Catherine Toth Fox December min read Hawaiian legend tells the story of the goddess Hi iaka who travels down a dusty trail on the windward coast of the Big Island of Hawai i to a beach where she meets her sisters including Pele the volcano deity And there on this remote beach in Puna Hi iaka danced what some consider the first hula The path to Hā ena Beach also called Shipman Beach is still intact Sometimes muddy and slippery the mile trail deposits visitors at an uncrowded shore known for its fine sands amid an otherwise rugged and rocky coast A hiker walks the mile Hoapili Trail through twisted tree trunks on Maui Photograph by Peter Unger Getty Images The Big Island s Puna Trail leads to Hā ena Beach Also known as Shipman Beach it s where legend says the hula was born Photograph by pawel gaul Getty Images During ancient times this was one of many footpaths ala hele across the Hawaiian Islands that linked coastal fishing villages In the mid the trail was straightened and widened to accommodate horses and wheeled carts Eventually as people moved inland these seaside settlements were abandoned and the trail neglected Today few people who venture along the Puna Trail to get to Hā ena s white sands know about its cultural importance It doesn t seem like much says Jackson Bauer who works for Nā Ala Hele Trail and Access Program which manages public resources related to trail maintenance But imagine Hi iaka walked on that trail History of Hawai i s trails One of the last pieces of legislation approved by Queen Lili uokalani before the controversial overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy was the Highways Act of It states that any trail or road then in existence in Hawai i belongs to the government even on privately owned land This further implies that these trails which were used by ancient Hawaiians to gather food wage battle get to places of worship and more are for public use accessible to all As a result of legislation by Queen Lili uokalani pictured here in ancient trails in Hawai i are state owned and may be publicly accessed Photograph by Bettmann Contributor Getty Images King Kamehameha III is pictured here in three years before he proposed the Great Māhele which redistributed some four million acres of land Photo by Kean Collection Staff Getty Images This law came at a critical time for establishing Native Hawaiian land rights In the Great Māhele proposed by King Kamehameha III redistributed about four million acres of land abolishing the feudal system and leading to private landownership Passed before Hawai i became a United States territory and state it ensured that the public and most importantly Native Hawaiians could continue to visit cultural sites Thanks to the queen s foresight the state now manages hundreds of miles of public trails that lead to heritage areas and native forests or follow meandering streams or tree lined ridges While many are now roads and highways bustling Ala Moana Boulevard on O ahu for example was a centuries old footpath that ran along the southern coastline others are forgotten trails you won t find in hiking guidebooks They re often less popular than the more modern summit or ridge hikes with sweeping views and parking lots But that s part of their appeal Explore year old hiking trails on this remarkable Greek island Identifying these footpaths and roads is an element of the Nā Ala Hele program s job Staff pore over hand drawn maps from the to find evidence of old trails in order to preserve them Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail separately managed partly by the National Park Service is a mile network that links communities temples fishing areas and other sites on Hawai i Some parts of the network are thought to have served ali i Hawaiian royalty other sections were for messengers who found walking quicker than sailing around parts of the island Another trail story tells of a swift runner who departed a village on the island s northwestern tip for Hilo and returned about miles each way through the interior of the island to bring the king a fish from his fishpond the fish was still alive The footpath along the south Kona

environment where a boardwalk path offers the best place to spot endemic honeycreeper birds some of which are critically endangered Photograph by Allan Baxter Getty Images A lot of these ancient trails have been in use for more than a thousand years and people still use them That s the really exciting part Bauer says He points to major roadways on the islands from the shop lined Ali i Drive in Kailua Kona on Hawai i to Pali Highway on O ahu which connects Honolulu with the island s windward side There s so much history along these trails and we want to keep them alive Walking the path of spirits When my six year old son and I hike along the wild coastline in Ka ena Point State Park on O ahu we walk in the footsteps of ancient Hawaiians The mile trail to the point meanders through one of the last intact coastal dune ecosystems in the main Hawaiian Islands About seabirds including the Laysan albatross and the wedge tailed shear water use Ka ena Point as their breeding grounds The area is also home to native wildlife such as the great frigatebird the red tailed tropic bird and the critically endangered Hawaiian monk seals This bird survived Maui s fires but it could soon vanish The path before us is lined with native coastal plants like beach naupaka a shrub with small white flowers ilima an indigenous ground cover with yellow flowers often strung in leis and naio or false sandalwood We might pass a family fishing in a moi hole a gap in the rocky shoreline where moi or Pacific threadfin can be found Across the islands moi known for its slightly sweet taste and firm texture was a fish often reserved for royalty I point out to my son places along the coast where his grandparents my parents who are at least third generation kama āina Hawai i born would fish for papio trevally and even moi Restrictions on the fish were eventually lifted The Ka ena Point trail takes hikers through one of the last intact coastal sand dune ecosystems in Hawai i Photograph by

The point itself is known as leina a ka uhane a leaping place of souls where the spirits of the recently dead could be reunited with their ancestors Here the leaping place is a large sloping rock facing the ocean It s still there You can still see it says La akea Perry a kumu hula master teacher of hula who takes guests of the Four Seasons Resort O ahu at Ko Olina on guided tours along the trail to Ka ena Point When you walk there it s like going to somebody s grave almost You walk that path knowing that it s the same path spirits travel to get to their final point Lush Pololū Valley can be seen via the Pololū Trail a mile out and back path on the Big Island Photograph by LanaCanada Getty Images People lived and died along these trails They grew crops and accessed the ocean They did everything here says Bauer If there s a trail then there s a lot more things nearby that need to be preserved The trails provide the clues Where to hike Hawaiian heritage trails Alaka i Swamp
