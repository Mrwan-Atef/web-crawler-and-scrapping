the upward trajectory of its ever expanding skyline Give the city its full name Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People s Republic of China and the curious case of an Asian megalopolis and its contradictions begin to make sense Governed by China but independent under the principle one country two systems since its return from British rule in Hong Kong is a true world city an intriguing mix of international expats Chinese mainlanders and native Hong Kongers who all contribute to the incredible food limitless shopping opportunities awesome nightlife and cultural happenings interwoven within its inimitable atmosphere Famed for a financial sector that rivals many world cities there s no denying that Hong Kong is fond of the dollar but business is just one part of the city s fabric Behind the financial bluster there are myriad perspectives to Hong Kong that contribute to its status as an exciting diverse city of epic urban and natural beauty Explore its neighborhoods and the awesome natural habitat that surrounds it and you ll discover the diversity firsthand Any visit here starts with shopping one of the city s favorite pastimes which can take you from the flagship designer stores of Causeway Bay to the hip boutiques of Tsim Sha Tsui and onto the markets of Mong Kok after dark Haggling is a sport here when it comes to markets so pack your poker face on any trip to Ladies Market and get ready to barter In a city as humid as Hong Kong indoor air conditioned shopping is the key to staying comfortable which partly explains the propensity for malls From the luxury of Elements Hong Kong to low rise independent street malls selling anything from electronics to tangzhuang jackets there s a mall for everyone in Hong Kong When you ve built an appetite shopping next it s time to eat and in Hong Kong that means anything from traditional Cantonese classics to haute cuisine from international chefs Whatever your tastes dim sum is a must preferably on a Sunday afternoon over newspapers and tea the way it s been enjoyed here for decades In Hong Kong you can even combine bargain dim sum with gourmet quality like at the one Michelin starred Tim Ho Wan at Sham Shui Po on Hong Kong Island where the dumplings rule After dark nowhere does nightlife like Lan Kwai Fong where the bars and clubs dotted around Wyndham Street create a frenzied strip of entertainment that goes all night long For a glimpse at laid back Hong Kong nightlife away from the crowds of Lan Kwai Fong head to the up and coming Kennedy Town on the west of the Island Home to a burgeoning craft beer scene Little Creatures Brewery and Bar is one big reason to head to the quaint residential hood out west With a vast percentage of the city limits given over to public parks and mountain terrain Hong Kongers know how to enjoy the nature on their doorstep From the hiking trails of Lantau Island to Aberdeen Country Park the beaches of Shek O to the alpine beauty of the Victoria Peak there is more outdoor adventure available here than you could ever hope to cover on a single trip In fact it s not just the natural wonders of Hong Kong that won t fit into just one visit we haven t even mentioned the Lantau Big Buddha the Peak funicular railway Stanley market the pink dolphins of Tai O fishing village the heart racing Happy Valley racetrack the incredible Man Mo Temple Hong Kong Disneyland the Hong Kong Museum of Art or the laid back multicultural community of Lamma Island Oh well this is a city that waits for no one you re just going to have to extend that trip
