not as far as it seems we promise Advertisement Once there cobble stoned twisting streets lead you to the grand Buda Castle razed and rebuilt numerous times through the ages and the Hungarian National Gallery within showcasing the history of Hungarian artistry from Renaissance stonework to striking century sculptures It s certainly worth having a nose around Nearby the fairy tale Fishermen s Bastion provides a dazzling view over Pest across the river For coffee and cake in the Castle District be sure to stop by Ruszwurm the longest running confectionery in Hungary â even the cafe s counter is years old It s always busy so avoid prime lunchtime for your best chance of getting seats If you can squeeze it in finish the morning exploring the fascinating Hospital in The Rock Nuclear

the cathedral s dome for more panoramic views of the city Next take a stroll down the city s showpiece avenue AndrÃ ssy which begins behind the Basilica For this journey you can pick up an ice cream skilfully made to resemble a rose from nearby Gelarto Rosa or for the more adventurous sample Budapest s best lÃ ngos a disc shaped deep fried dough topped with sour cream garlic and cheese â an all time favorite in Hungary Grab one from the small stall by the Arany JÃ nos utca metro station Full of fancy shops cafes restaurants and beautiful buildings AndrÃ ssy Avenue is Budapest s version of Paris s Champs Ã lysÃ es You ll find the Hungarian State Opera House here and the harrowing House of Terror Museum the former headquarters of the secret police where victims of cruel regimes were once tortured A visit makes for a deeply saddening but enlightening experience You can walk the tree lined AndrÃ ssy Avenue â which is flanked with cafes should you still be peckish â all the way to Heroes Square though you can shorten the trip by hopping on the Millennium Underground the oldest metro in continental Europe which runs the whole length of AndrÃ ssy The square is one of the city s most iconic monuments paying homage to major figures from Hungarian history Saturday evening Heroes Square is the gateway to City Park home to a rowboat filled lake â which in the winter often turns into an alfresco ice skating rink â and the stone Vajdahunyad Castle Have a stroll around the park to the world famous SzÃ chenyi Baths where you can soak in muscle melting healing thermal waters enjoy saunas and massages or even attend a sparty Budapest of course has many baths to choose from and SzÃ chenyi is often lumbered with the tag of touristy but with its contrasting colors of yellow walls and bright blue waters and wonderful outside pools it remains one of the most atmospheric Depending on your schedule dedicate a good two to three hours here After emerging from the spa dinner awaits at the legendary Gundel Restaurant nearby offering traditional Hungarian dishes with a modern twist When day turns into night a visit to one of the city s ruin bars is essential The highest concentration of these ramshackle spots adorned with skip found furniture and random knick knacks can be found in District VII An essential stop off is Fogas AkÃ cfa u a huge tree filled complex with a courtyard eight bars and an eclectic music choice Many people come to Budapest solely for the nightlife so get lost in it bar hop meet locals and try your hand at local pub games Shoes on the Danube

the world One of Budapest s most iconic landmarks the Parliament dominates the curve of the Danube and is home to the Holy Crown used to crown the country s monarchs since the century as well as other royal jewels English guided tours are available but it s best to book ahead Right by the Parliament you ll find Budapest s most moving memorial the Shoes on the Danube This poignant monument remembers the victims of the Holocaust who were marched to the riverbank on a dark winter s day ordered to remove their shoes and shot before falling into the fast flowing river beneath People watch the fountain show on Margaret Island Kata FÃ ri Lonely Planet Sunday afternoon For one of the prettiest panoramas of Budapest stroll along yellow Margaret Bridge next to the Parliament Halfway across you
