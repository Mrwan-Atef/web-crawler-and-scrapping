Images TRAVEL How this YouTuber created a travel encyclopedia of the world Over the past decade the creator and host of the Geography Now web series Paul Barbs Barbato has profiled every United Nations recognised country By Angela Locatelli and Paul Barbato November This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK On October Paul Barbs Barbato posted a video profiling Afghanistan on his YouTube channel Geography Now It was the second upload on the page posted after a trailer teasing what was to come an entry on every UN recognised country in the world released in alphabetical order the first such geographical encyclopaedia on social media to Paul s knowledge A decade on and more than three million subscribers later he wrapped the project up in October with a profile on Zimbabwe We talk to the host about his show from the subscribers who contributed to its episodes to the power of social media and what s next Where does your passion for travel come from I grew up in a diverse neighbourhood in Chicago around kids who spoke different languages They d tell me about their families show me their home countries on a map It sparked this intrigue this awareness of places outside the bubble where I lived I m a visual learner so the atlas became my favourite book It opened up an entire world What about the inspiration for Geography Now Here s a fun anecdote I really wanted to be on Globe Trekker a TV show in which different hosts travel and experience a destination s local way of life I sent in an audition video and never heard back so I decided to start my own programme Since I didn t have money to travel I came up with a format I could film from my house Which topics does Geography Now cover I talk about political geography a country s demarcation lines and what s under their sovereignty physical geography the landscape and resources demographics the people and culture and what I call the friendzone diplomatic relationships Within these segments are sections like food music sport But I try not to regurgitate facts What does it mean to be a person from that country That s what I strive to illustrate Paul Barbs Barbato began his YouTube channel Geography Now in and has amassed over three million followers Photograph by Storm Santos What s your relationship with the show s subscribers They play a huge role in the show They help me with planning and I couldn t have made some of the episodes without information they shared They get featured too For example the episode on Tuvalu an island nation in the Pacific Ocean was co hosted by local Keri Ann She wanted to be in the episode so I flew her out to the US Through Geography Now I ve met thousands of people from all over the world To me that s striking gold What s exciting about travel content on social media Social media can be a powerful tool People go online to be excited all the time why not do that with education You can use captions motion graphics and map animations users like to be entertained and that approach is something education can pursue with social media You ve visited countries What s the most memorable travel experience you ve had When I pick up a map I always look for what sticks out This is how I found the world s narrowest three country salient the wide gap border of Togo in between Burkina Faso and Ghana I went to Togo for the dedicated Geography Now episode reached the border and asked the guard there to let me walk this narrow strip of land across three nations I believe I became the first person to document it What s next I d visited fewer than countries when I signed up to YouTube and I started the channel to build a platform that would allow me to travel more Now I want to do a travel show my way an evolved version of Geography Now with me actually going places I ve been teaching for years it s time to start experiencing Published in the December issue of National Geographic Traveller UK To subscribe to
