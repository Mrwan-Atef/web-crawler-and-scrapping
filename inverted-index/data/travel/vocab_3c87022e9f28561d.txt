wander Lisbonâ s charming streets we have five shops you shouldnâ t miss Â Austin Bush In our Shops series we ll point you in the direction of our favorite independent shops across some of the world s best cities From food markets to bookshops vintage and homegrown design we ve found a diverse and exciting mix of local retailers where you can pick up one of a kind pieces Advertisement Lisbon â s cobblestone alleys domed churches and street art make it one of the most photogenic and simply delightful cities in the world Visitors take in a vibe of old fashioned elegance combined with creative buzz as they explore Lisbonâ s streets â a mix perhaps best expressed in its quintessential retail outlets Which are the spots that best embody the cityâ s spirit Read on for our picks for Lisbonâ s five best independent shops A Vida Portuguesa shop has an eclectic and elegant array of gorgeous gifts Â Austin Bush Pick up a memorable gift at A Vida Portuguesa The Portuguese language sign out front says â Welcome to the Most Beautiful Shop in Townâ â and I would up the ante to â in the World â A Vida Portuguesa occupies a former tile factory filled with brick archways and iron pillars with tile lined walls warm lighting old advertisements and apothecary like displays Itâ s like traveling back in time Advertisement This is essentially a souvenir shop â yet this term doesnâ t do justice to the eclectic elegantly curated selection of goods and legacy products sourced from across the country Think rustic hand woven wool rugs from Portugalâ s south old timey toys uniquely Portuguese kitchen tools quirky ceramics fragrant soaps even beautiful tins of metal polish I always make a beeline for the section that sells food and food related items like obscure cookbooks tinned seafood regional sweets wines And A Vida Portuguesa is even where I bought my shaving brush and aftershave Retrosaria Rosa Pomar features yarn from Portuguese sheep plus other knitting and sewing supplies fabrics and more Â Austin Bush Get your knit on at Retrosaria Rosa Poma Retrosaria is Portuguese for haberdashery the type of store that specializes in thread needles and buttons Retrosaria Rosa Pomar is this eponymous Portuguese artistâ s effort at the genre with a distinct emphasis on wool There are a few prÃªt Ã porter items available as well as some bolts of cloth including Portuguese flannel with handsome traditional patterns but the majority of stock here consists of beautiful balls of yarn made from Portuguese sheep If youâ re new to knitting a good starting point is the Badana Hat Kit which includes yarn from the churra badana sheep instructions on knitting a cap and a leather badge the package Rosaâ s effort to prevent the extinction of this rare indigenous breed You can find fashions knickknacks and more at funky vintage retailer Dona Ajuda Â Austin Bush Lisbonâ s best vintage shop is Dona Ajuda Lisbon has seen a small explosion of vintage and secondhand shops in recent years â and my favorite is Dona Ajuda Itâ s a legit not for profit staffed almost entirely by volunteers and with a policy that sees items donated to people in need every month in it helped out more than families Located in a former market it has a fun atmosphere as well as a diverse high quality and ever changing selection of goods Womenâ s clothing menswear childrenâ s clothing and kitschy knick knacks occupy spaces that used to house butcher shops while books and a small selection of furniture can be found in an adjacent market hall The section I always head for is a small room filled with kitchenware in particular I love the selection of rustic ceramic Portuguese cooking vessels plates pots and trays Stop in for a glass of wine leave with gourmet groceries at Lisbonâ s Comida Independente market Â Austin Bush Sip wine at and leave with superb groceries from Comida Independente Comida Independente exists in a zone between a wine bar and a mercearia a small Portuguese grocery store Regulars pop in for a chilled glass of wine and a snack â or and to do a bit of grocery shopping For me the latter often means now staples like a tub of Rainha do Pico butter â maybe the best butter in the world â and a tin of Pinhais sardines â maybe Portugalâ s best brand for tinned fish Thereâ s also a really excellent selection of wines with an emphasis on small producers Comida Independente also functions as a community with a weekly Saturday open air market bringing together farmers harvesters and food makers Travel is the theme at Palavra de Viajante bookshop with guidebooks plus internationally inflected titles of fiction history photography and more Â Austin Bush Dream up your next trip at travel bookstore Palavra de Viajante This handsome cozy bookstore stocks one of the most comprehensive collections of travel literature Iâ ve ever seen Beyond guidebooks the selection extends to travel related fiction current events history photography and of course Portugal with lots of titles in English Thereâ s even a section of travel books for kids â and my favorite part a corner with cookbooks of cuisines from around the world Owner Ana is knowledgeable and helpful and has also positioned Palavra de Viajante as a cultural center with a space that plays host to travel themed art exhibitions book launches and talks Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
