around two artificial lakes a network of canals and some bridges Blanketed in trees and parks Hamburg is one of Europe s greenest cities And the former warehouse district is being transformed into an übermodern place to live work and play Day One Morning Portside amble The North Sea wind can be brisk even in the summer so a sweater comes in handy To get a sense of the port start in HafenCity now Europe s largest construction project where warehouses are becoming apartments cafés and a flagship glass concert hall designed by Herzog de Meuron the Elbphilharmonie It won t open until but you can stick your head Alice in Wonderland style into a miniature version of the building to test the acoustics Head a few blocks east and take the pedestrian bridge across Brooktorhafen canal to the International Maritime Museum Hamburg Divided into nine decks the museum spans years of maritime history Among its oldest items a primitive boat carved from a year old tree trunk that was discovered in the Elbe River From here walk along the area s canals to another architectural wonder the triangular Chilehaus Built by a merchant who made a fortune in Chile it exemplifies a style known as brick

shipyards closes to traffic allowing pedestrians to walk or bike through Rent bikes from one of the rental points for the bright red StadtRAD public bikes Look for the tile friezes of among other

Grab a quick meal at one of the fish restaurants along Grosse Elbstrasse leading to the fish market Hummer Pedersen serves seafood fresh from the port the cold appetizer trio makes a good sampler Evening Dishy plates At the Michelin starred Landhaus Scherrer the Old World service and family atmosphere are in stark contrast to the racy charger plates portraying a model posed among fruits and vegetables A local artist produces a new version each season The restaurant deftly creates dishes such as beets four ways including a shot glass of foamy crimson soup In the middle price range is Parlament a relatively young restaurant in the cellar of the Rathaus the historic town hall The location imposes a gravitas that modernization has luckily not erased Order pannfisch fried fish fillets a simple local specialty or try the Salt Meadow lamb raised in the salty marshlands north of the city To check off a tourist must go to the St Pauli red light district to stroll past the seedy clubs of the Reeperbahn where the Beatles honed their signature sound Day Two Morning Art stroll Have breakfast at the branch of Mutterland near the Hamburg Hauptbahnhof the main train station Former flight attendant and Hamburg native Marge Ziegler produces the jams Making and eating jam is typical German she says There s no country where they eat so much of it Two flavors are specific to Hamburg Moin

this emporium of all things German carries artisanal whiskeys with cartoon labels and single source chocolates This is a good launching point for the museums along the Kunstmeile art mile Start at the imposing Kuntshalle Although the collection runs from Old Masters to contemporary from Rembrandt to Andreas Gursky its forte is modern German art such as Swiss German painter Paul Klee s gleaming The Golden Fish Head south parallel to the railroad tracks to the Deichtorhallen Europe s largest exhibition center for contemporary art and photography National Geographic Expeditions Travel with National Geographic Search Trips Afternoon Native goods Although Hamburg claims no paternity of the hamburger the patty of minced meat called a frikadelle is a close relative It is usually served with tomato sauce no bun There is no dispute however over Hamburg s ownership of the franzbrötchen a buttery pastry weighed down with just caramelized sugar and cinnamon Try one from the Dat Backhus chain Choose the branch at Speersort street to see the preserved base of a tower which may or may not be Hamburg s first building dating back to A D Another native is designer Jil Sander who has built her
