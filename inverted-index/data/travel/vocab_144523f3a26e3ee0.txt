Wadi Rum Jordan Jordan still too often dismissed by overly cautious tourists who skip over the entire region has been quietly building itself into the adventure hub of the Middle East Long blessed with myriad archaeological sites to tempt travelers on a cultural safari through the countryâ s historical treasures Jordan also beckons with an experience stuffed itinerary to quench the thirst of even the most adrenalin aching traveler Advertisement Hereâ s where to get your fix in the Middle East â s newest adventure playground Jump in a jeep for a long ride from Wadi Rum s visitor center to discover Jordan s tallest mountain Â Paul Biris Getty Images Climb Jordanâ s highest peak in Wadi Rum Best known for its rust colored Martian like landscapes Wadi Rum is no secret to the adventure seeker A sunrise trek on camelback or simply whizzing through the valleys on the back of a pickup truck is the classic Rum experience but thereâ s much more on offer in this sq km protected area For example Jordan â s tallest mountain the little visited Jebel Umm Ad Dami rises silently near the countryâ s southern border with Saudi Arabia and is about as far away as you can get from Wadi Rumâ s visitor center Jebel Umm Ad Dami isnâ t only for peakbaggers the hike to the top can be conquered in just an hour The path up the sandstone formation is marked with cairns but itâ s best to hire a guide youâ ll need someone to high five when you reach the Jordanian flag planted at the summit Even if you can only dedicate a few days to hiking the Jordan Trail make a start in Dana Â Hilda Weges Getty Images Hike the Jordan Trail â or at least part of it Nothing will make you feel closer to a place than walking its every curve but even if you donâ t have six weeks to set aside for this long country length stroll itâ s still possible to tackle shorter sections in just a few days The most incredible stretch of the Jordan Trail runs from the wild and wonderful valleys of the Dana Biosphere Reserve to the south where youâ re knocking on the back door of Petra earning the right to glimpse the Monastery first thing in the morning before any other tourists have bothered to wake up The route passes through the biologically diverse Dana where youâ ll descend through four distinct climate zones in just the first day before meandering past nomadic Bedouin camps shepherds guiding their flocks and rugged sandstone plateaus with uninhibited views across the Holy Land before arriving at Little Petra to give just a small sampling of the magic that the final day of the trek has in store Advertisement Remote award winning Feynan Ecolodge is one of the best places to stay in Jordan Â Shutterstock Go off grid at Feynan Ecolodge Often named the worldâ s best ecolodge sand colored Feynan is a desert mirage tucked into the eponymous mountain hugged valley The complex with guest rooms is powered entirely by solar energy and at nightfall an all vegetarian dinner is served by the light of hundreds of flickering candle flames Far from any proper pavement just getting here is an adventure Feynan awaits at the end of a rough track and the most atmospheric way to arrive is by foot on a day hike from Dana along the Jordan Trail Hospitality runs deep in Jordan and is a time honored tradition Â Lauren Keith Lonely Planet Experience true Jordanian generosity The hospitality of Jordanians is legendary and there is no better way to get closer to the local culture than by pressing pause Feynan Ecolodge works closely with the semi nomadic neighboring Bedouin tribes so that travelers can experience life from their perspective whether grinding pungent beans to make Arabic coffee weaving tents from goat hair or joining the shepherds and their reports for a day of trekking along the rocky slopes Local Bedouins in Petra also host a shepherdâ s breakfast where you can try your hand at milking the goats before settling down for a scrumptious feast with your spoils So many interactions with the Bedouin are refreshingly frank and open every conversation feels like a Q A cultural exchange where little seems off limits As a Bedouin said to us on a recent visit First you come as tourists and then you come back as friends Behind the main valley of Petra lies hundreds more tombs which see only a fraction of the visitors Â trabantos Getty Images Walk with the ancients and far from the crowds in Petra No adventure in Jordan is complete without a few days in bucket list topping Petra a mysterious sandstone city carved into cliffs by the now extinct Nabataean civilization â itâ s now a wonder of the world Even the entrance to the ancient city feels like the start of a quest wandering through the twists and turns of the Siq the kilometer long slot canyon gateway to the site you might not think it so strange that Westerners forgot Petra existed for nearly years Although most of Petraâ s most noteworthy monuments line the main trail a visit becomes even more rewarding off this beaten track For unbeatable views of the Treasury venture up to the heady heights of Al Kubtha Trail or stroll along the rarely sought out ancient tombs along Wadi Farasa behind the ancient city Take on eating as an endurance sport in Amman Hope you packed your appetite itâ s impossible to leave Jordan hungry Nowhere epitomizes that more than the foodie capital of Amman with its vast range of cuisines to satisfy any taste and budget Rainbow St is the obvious first destination for the ravenous the famous Al Quds fries up some of the cityâ s best falafel for less than about US An equally tasty chickpea competitor Hashem Restaurant is just down the hill For dessert try the ubiquitous kunafeh an originally Palestinian sweet concocted from salty white cheese soaked in sugary rosewater tinted syrup and finished off with crunchy pistachios For our money youâ ll find the best at Habibah where you can polish off your pastry from a paper plate in the alleyway Or if you want to make your own get your hands dirty on a cooking course at Beit Sitti Fish swim near the Cedar Pride wreck in the Red Sea near Aqaba Â Shahar Shabtai Shutterstock Go underwater with a scuba diving trip in Aqaba Thanks to recent conservation efforts the coral in the northern end of the Red Sea are flourishing putting another notch into the countryâ s belt of adventure options Despite Jordan having only of coastline Aqaba is quickly morphing into a diving hub of the region Dive instructors in the city offer full PADI courses If youâ re already certified plunge into the depths to explore the Cedar Pride a creature laden long sunken cargo ship thatâ s considered one of the best dives in the area Go on one of Jordan s wildest adventures in the slot canyons of Wadi Mujib Â Bargoti Photography Getty Images Conquer a canyon at Wadi Mujib Somehow still under the radar Wadi Mujib is one of Jordanâ s most exciting adventures and if you like your hike with a side of swimming these trails are certainly a walk on the wild side Just north of the Dead Sea this nature reserve is the lowest in the world and the rapid elevation changes mean that the riverâ s swift waters are choked into impossibly narrow slot canyons that require abseiling scrambling wading and sliding down natural waterfalls the perfect desert cool down Lauren Keith traveled to Jordan with
