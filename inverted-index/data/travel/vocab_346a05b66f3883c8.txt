with gorgeous coastline fresh foods and enchanting towns such as Ostuni Â Feng Wei Photography Getty Images Itâ s hard to sum up the kaleidoscope of territories ecosystems and rhythms of life that make up Puglia Perhaps thatâ s why some older Italians use the plural Le Puglie â many Pugliasâ to describe this alluring region of southern Italy Pugliaâ s miles of coastline â which was once part of the Magna Graecia and home to ancient Romansâ mighty flotillas â outlines what is known as the â boot heelâ of the Italian peninsula In the past decade some areas have made headlines for flashy weddings and celebritiesâ escapes Yet much of the region remains a little known historical natural and culinary gem When you venture into some of its hundreds of small towns you will encounter a traditional way of life filled with earthy flavors sharp colors and welcoming smiles Advertisement Intrigued yet Hereâ s all you need to know about Puglia Hiring a boat to take in Pugliaâ s dazzling shoreline is a wonderful way to beat the heat in peak season Stefano Zaccaria Shutterstock When is the best time to visit Puglia Puglia gets hectic during July and August when almost all Italians get their mandatory summer vacations Hotels are pricey and book up months in advance beaches are uncomfortably crowded and it can get scorching hot with some days heating up past C F During this time nightlife blooms Clubs in the Salento area blast music until sunrise music festivals such as Locus and Notte della Taranta draw musicians from all around the world and town squares fill to celebrate sagre di paese the much awaited yearly religious and food fairs Before and after the two central summer months the regionâ s mild climate produces C F days as early as April and into October making these months ideal if you are looking for peace charming towns and empty waters This is also an excellent time to venture into the green countryside and taste some of the regionâ s wine and olive oil Hotels are more affordable whatâ s more as the pressures of the high season abate the quality of food and services improves You might find yourself among few other travelers from November to March when some restaurants and hotels close for the season and public services wind down Still this might be the best time to sit at a neighborhood cafe drink an espresso and chat with the pugliesi Many of them will point you to their favorite local restaurant and take the time to explain why their townâ s panzerotto fried pastry tiedda Bariâ s famous rice potatoes and mussels dish or grape variety is undoubtedly and incontestably the best Watch people make pasta and purchase the hand made pasta too in Bari Ivo Antonie de Rooij Shutterstock How much time do I need to visit Puglia Puglia is not a day trip destination How long do you need to visit the region That depends on the time of the year and what you seek I would allow a full week to pass through its four main areas savor what the region offers and take some time to understand its rhythms But suppose you only have a weekend to spare In that case land in Bari in the morning have a focaccia barese slice at Panificio Fiore and accompany it with a cold Peroni beer while checking out the Basilica di San Nicola and the historic city center Next drive to visit Castel del Monte and sleep in a masseria in Valle dâ Itria The following day visit Alberobello and a coastal city such as Polignano a Mare or Monopoli If the weather and season allow for it count on a swim before returning home If you can spare a couple more days consider adding a night in the Alta Murgia area to enjoy a dinner in Minervino Murge After the day in Valle dâ Itria check out Lecce and its baroque splendors Renting a car is the best way to explore Puglia â though youâ ll see intrepid cyclists and biking groups too Andrea Pistolesi Getty Images Is it easy to get around Puglia Pugliaâ s two biggest airports at Bari and Brindisi are the main gateways to the region High speed trains from Rome Naples and Milan reach Puglia with a reasonable frequency Brindisi and Bari are also connected with ferry boats to Greece Croatia and Albania Advertisement For the richest Puglia experience we recommend renting a car Even for just a weekend having your own wheels will allow you to visit different places on the same day without relying on the often unreliable public transportation system Several tour operators organize group cycling trips around the region In the less hot seasons of spring and autumn itâ s common to encounter groups of adventurous cyclists on the roads Must visit places in Puglia If you reach Puglia by car from more northern parts of Italy that is to say all of them do not think Ah we have finally arrived once you cross the regional border You might still have miles â almost the distance between Paris and Amsterdam â to drive if you aim to reach its deep south in one go On the way south youâ ll cross Pugliaâ s four main subregions Along Pugliaâ s coast and in its hilly interior hiking opportunities abound Getty Images iStockphoto Gargano peninsula Promontorio del Gargano with its mountains passing above sea level towers over the rest of the region In this mountainous land Foresta Umbra â an ancient forest of centuries old beech trees â offers a variety of hiking opportunities Above the peninsula sits the castle topped Monte Santâ Angelo whose St Michael the Archangel sanctuary built inside an old karst cave is a UNESCO designated site of pilgrimage If you dig panoramic and curvy roads donâ t miss the drive between Peschici and Mattinata during which you notice old wooden structures leaning forward into the sea Those are trabucchi traditional fishing structures of the area While some lie abandoned others have been refurbished to host some of the most memorable restaurants in the area At Al Trabucco da MimÃ in Peschici you can sip a glass of dâ AraprÃ one of Pugliaâ s best sparkling wines in one of these old wooden structures while a band of jazz musicians plays as the sun drops down below the horizon The medieval Castel del Monte is an iconic landmark of Puglia Alexandre G Rosa Shutterstock Alta Murgia Where the Apennine mountains end the hilly Alta Murgia begins This stony land is one of Italyâ s last wild steppes I grew up here at Biomasseria Lama di Luna my familyâ s organic masseria one of the typical guest welcoming farmhouses that delineate the landscape All around a dozen towns hide precious city centers stunning but austere cathedrals â Trani â s cannot be missed â and castles With its octagonal geometry Castel del Monte a medieval castle and another UNESCO World Heritage Site is a must see wonder make sure you get a guide that will tell you more about its story and legends Antonella Urbano the horseback riding instructor who taught me how to ride when I was a kid can take you for a slow late afternoon horseback ride through Alta Murgia National Park The perfume of wild herbs and flowers surrounding you youâ ll be able to see the outline of the octagonal castle on the horizon Puglia produces about of Italyâ s olive oil and the town of Andria is first when it comes to the extra virgin kind Check out Le Contrade in the surrounding countryside for a walk in the olive fields followed by a tasting with Sebastiano and Valeria a young couple who make stellar EVOO Next try glass of Nero di Troia the local red wine at Morasinsi winery in Minervino where Sveva will tell you all about regenerative agriculture Stop for a meal at Antichi Sapori in Montegrosso and Mezzapagnotta in Ruvo both restaurants that have made local recipes based on foraging from within Alta Murgia National Park make sure you book well in advance Alberobelloâ s trulli â the cone shaped stone houses typical of the region â will enchant any visitor LauraVl Shutterstock Valle dâ Itria Past Bari the regional capital youâ ll hit Valle dâ Itria where your first sight will be a continuous forest of monumental olive trees so twisted by their age that their branches seem to be supporting the weight of the sky All around white towns pop out on various hilltops With its stunning views Ostuni known as the â White City â claims the prize for the most brilliant At the same time Alberobello yet another of Pugliaâ s UNESCO World Heritage Sites will leave you speechless with its trulli traditional stone houses with cone shaped roofs If you stop by the medieval town of Cisternino stop into one of its many butchers and select your set of bombette â â little bombsâ of sliced meat rolled and stuffed with cheese and herbs â that theyâ ll grill for you on the spot Admire the view from one of Polignano a Mare â s dramatic cliffside terraces â and maybe stop for a tuna tartare and burrata sandwich at Pescaria If you fancy sleeping in a masseria Borgo San Marco Il Frantoio and Masseria Cervarolo are worth considering Lecce is a treasure trove of baroque architecture marcobrivio photography Shutterstock Salento As you reach the tip of the region you enter Salento the easternmost part of Italy Its capital Lecce is known as the â Florence of the Southâ for the stunning baroque architecture and splendid palaces that grace its city center Each town in Salento has a historic center that brightens up during summer nights when religious festivals and food fairs take place In addition to its history the crystal clear waters off Salentoâ s coast set it apart With choices like Torre Santâ Andrea Porto Cesareo Castro Santa Maria di Leuca Gallipoli and Porto Selvaggio youâ ll have plenty of options for swimming or perhaps renting a little boat to cruise along the rocky coastline for the day For the past years a foreign bacteria has devastated the region killing most of its olive trees those gray trees youâ ll see along the road are all dead â yet a pocket of young farmers is working to revive this vital resource TÃ ccaru for example is processing the beautiful century old dead olive wood and replanting young specimens resistant to the deadly invader Wineries are doing their part for sustainability too preserving the areaâ s old vineyards At Castello Frisari in Scorrano and Castel di Salve in Depressa young winemakers will be eager for you to taste traditional primitivo and negramaro varietals Between glasses of wine check out La Taverna del Porto in Tricase and Farmacia dei Sani in Ruffano for a hearty meal The drive from Otranto to Santa Maria di Leuca offers amazing views Paky Cassano Shutterstock My favorite thing to do in Puglia My perfect Puglia day involves a drive along the coastal road that connects Otranto and Santa Maria di Leuca in Salento On the way Iâ ll stop off at one of the rocky bays with access to the sea for a swim maybe at Grotta Zinzulusa in Castro followed by a caffÃ leccese an espresso shot with ice and a finger of almond syrup and sweet pasticciotto at Martinucci Next I keep driving until I reach Tricase Porto for another dip in the clean port waters To end the day Iâ ll walk a few stairs up to CaffÃ dâ Oltremare for a glass of negroamaro wine a handful of taralli and pickled olives Sitting on the open terrace overlooking the sea lets the blue Mediterranean calm my eyes and reward me for taking the time to slow down Youâ ll find your euro will go far at bars and restaurants in Puglia
