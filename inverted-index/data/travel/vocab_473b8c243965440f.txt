Walker Jun min read Share Make like the locals for a sundowner aperitivo at Sky Bar at Hotel Hostal Cuba and drink in Palma below Â Hotel Hostal Cuba Iâ ve watched Palma â s culinary star shoot high in recent years Mallorca â s capital is quickly becoming one of the hottest cities in the Med for food Raiding sea mountains meadows farms and orchards chefs are elevating stunningly fresh island produce to the extraordinary in dishes full of flair and creativity Over the past years Palma has become a love affair on the plate And eating here is incredibly chilled You donâ t have to book months in advance to score top tables times are relaxed Mallorcans typically dine late and youâ re often welcome to just rock up Part of the beauty of Palma is wandering through its honey stone streets starting the day with coffee and pastries on a sunlit plaÃ a easing gently into a starlit evening with tapas and vermouth in a backstreet vermuterÃ a or kicking back with an aperitivo in an inner courtyard bar No hassle No rush No pretense Theatrically positioned by the sea Palma has always looked out across the water to the world beyond And the world now comes to Palmaâ s kitchens Astoundingly fresh sushi ceviche with pisco sours Brazilian barbecue classic French â youâ ll find the lot alongside Michelin starred restaurants where chefs like Marc Fosh and AdriÃ n Quetglas pride themselves on simplicity in dishes that big up Balearic flavors as clean and bright as the light that beats down on these streets Mama Carmen is a great breakfast and brunch spot by the Mercat de Santa Catalina Â Mama Carmen Palma de Mallorca is one of the best cities to visit next year See our full list of Best in Travel winners Breakfast Most Palma locals save their appetite for lunch and Iâ ll often take their lead just grabbing a coffee and pastry But my my what pastries The Mallorcans excel on this front and pinning down the cityâ s best ensaÃ mada a feather light beautifully flaky snail shaped pastry lightly dusted with icing sugar can turn into a quest I suggest keeping it traditional and heading to the likes of family run old school Ca n Joan de S Aigo which has been baking since or the Forn del Santo Cristo where sublime ensaÃ mades come with silky fillings from marzipan to honey white chocolate and dulce de leche For something more substantial nose around the produce laden stalls at the Mercat de Santa Catalina before nipping into Mama Carmenâ s for brunch A bubble of artsy back in time warmth this cafe does smoothies specialty coffees try the pumpkin spiced latte granola bowls sprinkled with seasonal fruits cacao nibs and edible flowers impressive vegan eggs and artisan baked bread with toppings like avocado rocket and fetaâ all served with love on pretty vintage crockery If Iâ m more in a NYC mood Iâ ll make for Rosevelvet Bakery near La Rambla instead They do fabulous coffee moreish pistachio pastries and brunch specials like pulled pork brioche with pickled onion and coriander and wicked huevos rancheros Mexican style eggs Finally Swedes are doing wonderful things at sourdough bakery Fika Farina headed up by Mattias MÃ rtensson and his partner Jimmy Groth Come for coffee fresh pressed orange juice that tastes of pure sunshine and some of the best cinnamon buns pains au chocolat and open sandwiches youâ re likely to get anywhere NanÃ Coffee Lab is a much loved coffee spot on Passeig des Born Â Nano Coffee Coffee Palmaâ s coffee scene has exploded recently Gone are the days when the only options were cafÃ con leche coffee with milk and cortado espresso with a splash of milk Now you canâ t move for chat of third waves and single origin beans The best way to stay connected Saily provides a hassle free solution to travel data â just choose your data plan and prepare for your trip When you get to your destination you can go online right away Get your eSIM In an untouristy part of town La Molienda is one of my go tos for a freshly roasted cup With an eye on the ethical sustainable sourcing of beans this is hands down some of Palmaâ s best coffee When the sunâ s out this corner cafÃ â s terrace hums with locals sipping artistically presented cappuccinos and citrusy cold brews Bang in the center just off PlaÃ a Major Arabay has been going strong since and is now an industro cool cafe roastery and barista academy These days itâ s all organic and fair trade and the smell of coffee hits you like a crisp left hook as you step inside The baristas really know their stuff whether you go for a frappÃ or French press Wander along tree lined boulevard Passeig des Born chuck a left down a quiet street and youâ ll come to NanÃ Coffee Lab This urban cool metro tiled number takes its beans seriously I love the happy hiss of the La Marzocco espresso machine the cute window seat space for max two and what they rightly call â damn good coffee â Britsh Baleriac fusion cuisine at Market Kitchen Â Jodi Hinds R Prawns and chips always hits the spot at Mola Â Mola Lunch Opposite the food market in the artsy Santa Catalina neighborhood Mola hits the sweet spot with its breezy blue and white splashed interior and chilled atmosphere On the menu round the world sharing plates bigging up primary ingredients The zingy Thai salad and perfectly crisp tempura prawns with wasabi mayo are divine Turn the corner and thereâ s the Market Kitchen headed up by food mad Brits Rob and Amber Kirby who have found their spiritual foodie home in Palma With cookbook writing and TV chef experience under his belt Rob now devotes his energy into rolling out British Balearic fusion food in a quirky vintage cool bistro setting The London salt beef bagel with cheese cured pickles and homemade crisps is superb as are the Sunday roasts Except here they are often served with mimosas and blood orange negronis More central Who would think that just a five minute stroll from Palmaâ s knockout Gothic cathedral you would find a treasure like the Forn de Sant Joan a stunning minimalist conversion of a century bakery complete with brick walled cellar Here Mallorcan ingredients are imaginatively elevated in dishes like oyster with cold almond soup and salmon roe slow cooked lamb with Idiazabal cheese and mint oil and tuna tartare with guacamole Try La Rosa VermuterÃ a for a central and buzzy aperitivo Â Sasha Brady Aperitivo Warming up for the evening with a vermouth fortified wine flavored with spices and herbs is a thing here One of the most atmospheric picks is central and buzzy La Rosa VermuterÃ a where quality red white and rosÃ vermouths are nicely paired with tapas As the sun sinks and sky pinkens I love a sky high aperitivo Thereâ s a growing crop of rooftop bars in Palma but few can rival the Sky Bar at Hotel Hostal Cuba for dress circle views of the Bay of Palma and the cathedral which glows gold in the moody blues of dusk They do great cocktails including a cava spritzed Bellini and Balearic signatures like Mule Xoriguer gin with ginger beer passion fruit and orange bitters For holiday flavor and a dash of class the poolside Singular Rooftop Terrace is also good Slightly more affordable and less posh is the eighth floor Hotel Almudaina Sky Bar where the city spreads out at your feet AdriÃ n Quetglas is a great spot for a special lunch or dinner Â Arthur Le Brac Dinner Palmaâ s summery heat and sociable nature mean that Iâ m often more in the mood to tapear eat tapas â yep itâ s a verb when the sun plops into the Med rather than go for a blowout dinner There are some incredible options for doing just that with top billing going to La Bodeguilla run by two food loving brothers Itâ s a grown up monochrome space with giant hunks of serrano dangling from the ceiling and wine barrel tables referencing the phenomenal wine list that canters boldly around Spain The produce led menu pops with island flavors from meltingly tender suckling pig to scarlet shrimp slick with garlicky aioli I love AdriÃ n Quetglas for a special lunch and for dinner too it s unmissable Vertical gardens and fern prints bring a natural touch to this Michelin starred number Hailing originally from Buenos Aires AdriÃ n returned to his Mallorcan family as a passionate traveler talented chef and advocate for â democratizing haute cuisine â This is reflected in ingeniously simple dishes like turbot with peas Tramuntana lemon and lemon verbena and gazpacho with prawn carpaccio pickled watermelon and basil almond ice cream The five course lunch is a snip at â But for romance La VermuterÃ a wins Tucked away in the palm speckled inner courtyard of Can Cera this century palau mansion is now a boutique bolthole in Palmaâ s old town heart Itâ s an enchanting backdrop for zingy cocktails and island wines matched with exquisite island tapas from Mallorcan cheeses to black pork sobrasada and smoked sea bass If youâ re up for more of a party vibe swing over to dark sexy Vandal look out for the graffiti at the entrance Itâ s full of retro sparkle and Mallorcans sipping signature cocktails like Tonic gin rosemary and clementine marmalade Argentine Italian chef BernabÃ Caravotta delivers playful palate awakening sharing plates like ceviche cones with coconut foam pisco Bloody Mary oysters and slow cooked lamb with labneh and Moroccan spices All utterly delicious Cocktails at the Great Gatsby esque speakeasy Door Â Door Bar If it has been a hot one and I want to dip my toes in the water and peer out across the Med with a sundowner as DJs spin clubby Ibiza tunes I head to Anima Beach but a stylish flip flop from the center Later on for a speakeasy vibe jazzy beats and mind blowing drinks I recommend the Clandestino Cocktail Club The cocktails here are works of art â take the zesty matador pisco calvados lemon yuzu foam and Inca bitters for instance For time travel I adore Abaco Push open the heavy wooden door of this opulent century palau and youâ ll find yourself in a fairy tale courtyard brimming with fruit flowers and classical music Here you can nurse a house cocktail rum whisky Grand Marnier and fruit juice and feel like a film set extra as candlelight flickers Craving one last late night cocktail Check out Door hidden in a warren of stone walled lanes near the old capuchin convent Find the secret code or ring the bell to be admitted to this speakeasy cave with Great Gatsby esque dÃ cor and bohemian vibes Itâ s a smashing spot for inventive cocktails like gin dry vermouth JalapeÃ os and burnt rosemary as live bands play everything from flamenco to swing Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Mallorca Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers Everywhere Follow us
