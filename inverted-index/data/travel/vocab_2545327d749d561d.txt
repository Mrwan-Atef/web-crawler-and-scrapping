So is Panama expensive Well it s not the most expensive country in Central America â that prize goes to Costa Rica closely followed by Belize â but thrifty travelers will need to plan carefully and sacrifice a few home comforts to keep costs down Fortunately there are plenty of ways to save on food lodgings transport and excursions The beaches are free and thereâ s no shortage of outdoor

during the wet season to start saving money The cheapest time to visit Panama is during the wet season which runs from May to November Hotel rates can drop to compared to the high season December to April but you will have to contend with bursts of torrential rain Most downpours are quite brief erupting in the afternoon and clearing an hour or two later but there can be days of continuous rainfall Certain activities such as birdwatching and white water rafting are much better in the rainy season Bocas del Toro has a highly changeable microclimate the province is frequently wet when the rest of the country is dry and sometimes vice versa International flights to Panama are usually cheapest towards the end of the wet season from September to November Flying to Costa Rica and getting the bus over the border can be cheaper Â Rainer Lesniewski Getty Images If you only intend to visit western Panama consider flying into Costa Rica Many of Panamaâ s best attractions lay in the western provinces of ChiriquÃ and Bocas del Toro If you donâ t intend to travel beyond these areas itâ s sometimes but not always more economical to fly to San JosÃ in Costa Rica and then travel overland to Panama especially if you re a backpacker The direct bus from San JosÃ to the international border at Paso Canoas on the edge of ChiriquÃ is an hour or so longer than the bus from Panama City to David the second largest city in Panama and capital of ChiriquÃ Youâ ll have to pass through immigration which can be time consuming The journey to ChiriquÃ is quicker and cheaper if you use intercity buses rather than international ones like Ticabus which typically means longer commutes and higher prices but it doesnâ t stop in David Get the Metrobus to from the airport Â Kryssia Campos Getty Images Take the bus to and from Tocumen airport Official taxis from Tocumen International Airport to downtown Panama City can set you back US to US A shared taxi is cheaper at around US per person if traveling solo The cheapest option is the Metrobus A bus ticket with them costs no more than US Before leaving the airport be sure to buy a rechargeable Metrocard suitable for use on all Metro buses and trains They cost US and are good to go with US of fares included Note you will need a Metrocard to access long distance services at Albrook bus station Advertisement Backpackers or single travelers should stay in hostels Â undefined undefined Getty Images If youâ re single stay in a hostel dorm Single travelers will find the cheapest digs in hostel dorms Depending on location you ll get a few amenities and clean quarters for US to US per night Hostels are widespread in the major tourist hubs of Panama City Boquete and Bocas del Toro but less common elsewhere They are a great way to meet fellow travelers too If there s more than one of you traveling book a hotel Â Cavan Images Getty Images Couples and groups should stay in hotels A private room in a cheap hotel is roughly the same price as a private room in a hostel around US to US per night In terms of comfort however hotel rooms are usually superior The cheaper more spartan rooms have fans and cold water only showers air conditioning can bump up prices by US to US Some hotels have a handful of extremely basic ultra cheap rooms US to US with a shared bathroom ask reception if they have algo mÃ s something cheaper or un quarto con baÃ o compartido a room with a shared bathroom Of course the main disadvantage of using hotels as cheap accommodation is that you wonâ t have a shared kitchen at your disposal A hammock can be the cheapest way of grabbing a bed for the night Â MarcPo Getty Images If you really want to save sleep in a hammock If you donâ t mind roughing it or sleeping in a homestay a hammock is the cheapest option Hostels typically charge US to US per night for a pitch and you may find locals prepared to offer the same service from their family home Use mosquito repellent nets and or insecticide coils especially in the wet season A warm blanket or sleeping bag may be necessary as temperatures can drop markedly at night even in the steamy lowlands Note itâ s unsafe to sleep overnight in public spaces including the beach Be careful which taxis you use if you want to save some money in Panama Â Jeremy Poland Getty Images Use public transportation in Panama City Panama City taxis are notoriously wily Drivers overcharging is the norm especially if you appear to be foreign Worse yet the city is frequently gridlocked making travel by car slow and inefficient To save money and hassle use Metro buses and trains to get around US to US per journey If you must use taxis try to agree on a price before getting in And if your driver turns out to be a good one many of them are get their cellphone number for future use Avoid tourist taxis and taxis that wait outside hotels They will definitely overcharge you In Panama Uber is usually cheaper and easier than taxis Opt for buses over domestic flights Domestic flights are undeniably fast You can cross the entire country from Panama City to David by plane in about an hour But with most round trip fares exceeding US domestic flights are not cheap and carry a hefty carbon footprint too Although significantly slower the same trip from Panama City to David takes seven to nine hours Panama bus travel is far more economical and environmentally friendly Catch a ride from the Terminales David PanamÃ TDP on the Padafront buses Panama sells plenty of cheap fresh fruit such as coconuts Â Pedro Merino Getty Images Gorge on fruit for breakfast Fresh fruit in Panama is nutritious delicious ubiquitous and cheap Options include a rainbow array of locally grown produce like pineapples papayas avocados bananas watermelons and oranges Get fruit from street vendors local markets or supermarkets a fruit breakfast in a restaurant is relatively poor value Smoothies are another healthy and economical option Feast on carbs for lunch If you intend to eat out a lot lunch is the most economical meal of the day Street food is thin on the ground in Panama but cheap sit down eateries abound and usually offer inexpensive set menus and or carb rich lunch buffets for around US a head A typical Panamanian lunch consists of a fatty meat or chicken main with a generous side of rice and beans plus a few slivers of sometimes sweetened plantain and a sugary drink Sadly vegans and vegetarians are not well served in Panama You can drink tap water in most places in Panama but not all Â NTCo Getty Images You can generally drink the tap water With the exceptions of Bocas del Toro Guna Yala and other remote areas the tap water in Panama is generally safe for consumption Save on dollars and plastic waste by refilling reusable water bottles at a kitchen faucet Sourcing your own guide can be cheaper than using a tour operator Â Jeremy Poland Getty Images Choose guides and excursions carefully Unless times are very tight you will want to splurge on one or more tours If you speak Spanish reasonably well sourcing your own local guides can work out cheaper than using a tour operator Itâ s best to seek solid recommendations from your hotel or hostel as they typically know where the best daily deals are Most towns have an office of the National Environment Ministry Mi Ambiente and will point you in the right direction
