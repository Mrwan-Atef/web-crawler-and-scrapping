and mobile networks Monica Gerges Dec min read Share Stay connected with our guide to wi fi and mobile phone services in Egypt Lizavetta Shutterstock Egypt â s rich cultural heritage and modern digital conveniences are far from being mutually exclusive Just because Egypt is a land of antiquities doesnâ t mean your experience needs to be antiquated â though we do still recommend grabbing a postcard or two for noveltyâ s sake And while there are moments where youâ ll want to switch off from the world and lose yourself to Cairo â s vibrant city streets being disconnected should always be optional not accidental With four major telecom providers a variety of data plans and the growing adoption of eSIM technology travelers have a number of options when it comes to staying connected while visiting Egypt Will my phone work in Egypt Roaming with your US carrier in Egypt can get pretty pricey Sure itâ s convenient but roaming packages from most US carriers can come with hefty charges and inconsistent coverage Instead consider exploring options like local SIM cards or international eSIMs such as Saily or Airalo Either way a gigabyte of data can stretch further in Egypt than you might think For light users who just need data to refresh their inbox or avoid getting lost will likely be sufficient for a week If travel content creation is your bread and butter or if you plan on streaming videos or uploading photos should do the trick Vodafone and WE Telecom are the network providers in Egypt with the most widespread coverage Antonio Batinic Shutterstock What mobile networks are available in Egypt Egypt has four primary mobile network operators Vodafone Orange Etisalat now e and WE Telecom For the most widespread coverage and strongest services opt for Vodafone or WE Telecom If youâ re sticking to big cities like Cairo or Luxor and donâ t plan on roaming off the beaten path you can head to Orange or e for good coverage with more competitive prices coverage is widespread especially in major cities like Cairo and Alexandria as well as tourist destinations like Luxor Aswan and across the Red Sea Mobile internet in Egypt is generally reliable in urban areas should you find yourself in a more rural region or somewhere in the desert you may experience less consistent service or significantly lower signal quality How can I get a local SIM card Visitors can pick up a local SIM card at mobile provider stores supermarkets or mall kiosks Mobile providers also have kiosks set up at Egyptâ s major airports but itâ s best to grab a local SIM card from outside the airport All youâ ll need to buy a local SIM card is your passport â itâ s that simple Before leaving the store test the SIM card to make sure itâ s activated and has the correct amount of mobile data on it Most providers will recommend that you download their app to track your usage and top up your account if necessary Youâ ll need to enter your phone number which you can find on the back of the SIM card package Is eSIM available in Egypt and how does it work eSIM technology has gained traction in Egypt with all four mobile network operators offering eSIM services for compatible devices as of December The best way to stay connected Saily provides a hassle free solution to travel data â just choose your data plan and prepare for your trip When you get to your destination you can go online right away Get your eSIM International eSIM providers allow you to activate a data plan before your arrival which can be a great connectivity option These plans are ready to use as soon as you land in Egypt saving you time and ensuring youâ re immediately connected so you can make it out of the airport hassle free We recommend Saily as our eSIM partner Use code to receive off your Saily mobile data plan Reliable public wi fi is hard to find in Egypt and mobile internet can be patchy in more remote areas Rudi Suardi Getty Images Where can I find reliable wi fi in Egypt Reliable wi fi in Egypt is truly hit or miss For starters wi fi at Cairo International Airport is unreliable and often unavailable making it difficult to depend on for your first connection upon arrival Travelers should consider using an Egypt eSIM to set up mobile data as soon as they land especially if those looking to use a ride hailing app to make their way out of the airport While youâ re out donâ t depend on the local Dunkinâ or McDonaldâ s for a free public wi fi connection Some cafes coffee shops and restaurants do offer free public wi fi but connection speeds leave much to be desired On the other hand if youâ re in a major city like Cairo or Alexandria you can always pop by a coworking space if you need to sit down and get connected Wi fi is typically provided at most hotels hostels and resorts Speeds can be slower than average especially in budget accommodations expect better connectivity at luxury hotels but itâ s a good idea to have mobile data as a backup â especially if a constant reliable connection is a necessity for you How fast and reliable is the internet Mobile internet is generally reliable in Egyptâ s major cities and across its tourist areas However there may be occasional outages especially in more remote regions or along desert highways In the city mobile internet download speeds sit at around megabits per second Mbps which is sufficient for browsing streaming and video calls More isolated destinations like Siwa Oasis or the desert outskirts will have lower speeds and far spottier connections To manage your expectations and put this into perspective speeds in New York or Los Angeles sit well above Mbps Having offline maps or downloaded content is a good idea if you plan to travel to less connected areas Are there any internet restrictions or censorship laws Censorship laws are nothing to worry about if youâ re in Egypt as a short term visitor They donâ t affect social media access or access to any travel related resources you may need to navigate your way around the country Should you happen to come upon a censored local website while in Egypt a VPN may help Mobile internet can be patchy in more remote areas such as Siwa Oasis Shutterstock Can I stay connected at major tourist sites Major tourist sites like the Pyramids the Valley of the Kings and Egyptâ s many museums do not offer free wi fi so you ll need to rely on mobile data Will I encounter language barriers when getting connected A lot of people in Egypt speak quite a bit of English so thereâ s no need to worry about language barriers when it comes to getting connected Most mobile operators in Egypt offer English language websites and apps making it easy to manage your account and track your usage Customer support is also readily available in English whether youâ re giving customer service a call chatting with them via the providerâ s website or youâ re face to face with an in store rep at most tourist frequented locations How much does it cost to stay connected in Egypt Prepaid SIM cards are the most economical option for short term visitors Most providers have a travel line with data local minutes and international minutes For example Orangeâ s Holidays Line starts at US for of data and local minutes while e â s Traveler line gives you of data local minutes and five international calls for the same price You may be tempted to opt for a pay as you go option with a local provider but their units points systems may be a bit confusing to navigate and you donâ t want to find yourself overpaying or wondering why youâ re suddenly disconnected and having to recharge yet again International eSIM options like Saily can run around US per GB but they offer a convenient hassle free solution for those who prefer to set everything up before arrival People are often using their phones in Egypt but ensure your cell is kept quiet when visiting a mosque Shutterstock What local tech customs or etiquette should I be aware of Egyptians love their tech Youâ ll find that just about everybody has a phone most people are often on their phones and many people opt out of using headphones in public spaces Youâ ll want to keep it quiet if youâ re visiting one of Egyptâ s many mosques as some historic mosques are still in use and itâ s not appropriate to use a phone while prayers are going on However if youâ re in there at any other time â even if there are individuals in there choosing to pray â you just need to use headphones or talk quietly Egypt uses plug types C and F with a standard voltage of bring a universal adapter if your devices arenâ t compatible How do I contact emergency services if needed The general emergency numbers in Egypt are for police and for medical emergencies Downloading maps and using Google Translate are great ways to navigate offline and overcome language barriers in case you find yourself without an internet connection Plus the locals are friendly and always happy to help so donâ t
