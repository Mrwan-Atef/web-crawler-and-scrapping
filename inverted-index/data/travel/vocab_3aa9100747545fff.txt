budgets â here s how to travel here and save money Â Jupiterimages Getty Images With dozens of luxurious all inclusive resorts and some of the most popular attractions in the Caribbean a trip to Jamaica can be pricey But it doesnâ t have to be Jamaica offers myriad experiences that donâ t put a strain on your wallet from free street dances to inexpensive concerts and stunning secluded rivers and beaches Jamaicans have crafted their own cultural experiences and way of life that are both enriching and affordable Here are the top tips on how to enjoy the best of Jamaica without draining your finances Average daily costs in Jamaica Guesthouse motel room JM Basic hotel room for two JM Self catering apartment including Airbnb JM Public transportation route taxis and buses JM per ride Coffee or tea JM Patty JM Bottled water JM Lunch for two JM Dinner for two JM Beer at a bar JM Advertisement Average daily cost JM per person for a basic room plus three meals a day at low end restaurants and inexpensive entertainment Stay at a low budget hotel Jamaica offers a range of different types of accommodations from luxury resorts to motels Low budget hotels are the middle ground lesser known typically two or three star accommodations that provide basic amenities Properties such as the Shirley Retreat Hotel in Kingston Tobyâ s Resort in Montego Bay Pineapple Court Hotel in Ochi Rios and Lashings Boutique Hotel in Treasure Beach are a step up from guesthouses and motels but still extremely affordable At most of these hotels youâ ll also be able to get some meals on the property Guesthouse rooms are a cheaper option but they arenâ t always the most comfortable and some have a tainted reputation JUTC yellow buses operate throughout Kingston and beyond Â colin wheeler Shutterstock Take public transportation The most affordable option for getting around Jamaica is public transportation If youâ re in or near Kingston state owned JUTC yellow buses operate throughout and beyond the city Payment is by cash upon entry or you can purchase a JUTC Smartercard and use it as you travel Thereâ s a bus park in every town and a bus stop on almost every main road Route taxis with red license plates and minibuses or coaster buses are also popular methods of transportation all costing around JM per ride If youâ re on the west north or south coasts you wonâ t find JUTC buses â route taxis and minibuses are the main way to travel for Jamaicans For route taxis you can also pay a little more for drivers to go off their usual route for example if your destination is a little further than their final drop off point If youâ re traveling from town to town consider taking the Knutsford Express bus which operates in most towns in Jamaica This is more comfortable and a bit more expensive than other forms of public transportation but still cheaper than getting a private driver or renting a car Visit cookshops for the best authentic Jamaican meals If you find yourself craving authentic Jamaican food donâ t think you need to go to an upscale restaurant to get the best â most locals take advantage of the thousands of cookshops on the island The running joke is thereâ s one on almost every street in Jamaica Advertisement These small food establishments serve hot meals in styrofoam takeout boxes at the most reasonable prices traditional favorites such as oxtail curry goat stew peas or fried chicken and rice and peas for under JM Many donâ t have a dining area just a kitchen and window where you order Grocery shop at mini marts or wholesales If youâ re planning to cook and need ingredients or just want to stock up on groceries avoid the island s major supermarkets such as Megamart Loshusan and Hi Lo Supermarkets as they re more expensive You can generally find much of the same selection for a lot less at a small wholesale store the word is usually in the name for example Tiger Wholesale in Kingston or mini mart Many wholesales donâ t have aisles you can browse â only a window to order what you want and pay Mini marts will always have aisles but they are much smaller in comparison to a general supermarket These stores also tend to have items sold in bulk or special deals For fruits and vegetables again avoid major supermarkets and get your products in the town markets or from street vendors who tend not to hold a price Donâ t be afraid to negotiate in Jamaica s craft markets Â Darryl Brooks Shutterstock Negotiate your prices Speaking of not holding a price donâ t be afraid to negotiate In craft markets vendors are all about the sale even if it means selling their products for a little less than what they want to Donâ t be unreasonable but definitely bargain â youâ ll get the best deals Get a Jamaican SIM card If you plan on staying in Jamaica for a lengthy period of time it s best to get a local SIM card A SIM can be purchased at any outlet of the two mobile networks on the island Digicel or FLOW International plans or minutes for a foreign number can cost a pretty penny It works out cheaper to get a local SIM card which costs less than JM then buy a data plan or international minutes if you need to Use local currency Local businesses and vendors especially those in tourist areas will sometimes charge in US dollars using the most expensive rate possible especially when they recognize that youâ re a tourist Get and use Jamaican currency â that way you wonâ t be tricked into paying a â foreign priceâ for goods and services Winnifred Beach in Portland is one of many popular free spots Â Franz Marc Frei Getty Images Take advantage of free rivers and beaches Thereâ s lots to see and do in Jamaica While many of the points of interest and attractions charge a fee there are also tons of free beaches across the island where you can hang out unwind or even party Winnifred Beach in Portland Seven Mile Beach in Negril and Treasure Beach on the south coast are among the popular free spots Jamaicans also take advantage of many secluded rivers and waterfalls Reggae Falls Nanny Falls Old Spanish Bridge and Salt River to name a few that are mostly free â and rival some of the islandâ s most famed attractions Find free entertainment galore Jamaica is never short of entertainment From massive festivals and concerts to small street parties there is always something to do If youâ re a fan of dancehall the legendary weekly Weddy Weddy party at the Stone Love Headquarters in Kingston is one of the most popular and inexpensive street parties in Jamaica The entry fee is only JM and the party usually goes until the wee hours of the morning Across the island usually in small communities street parties happen on a daily basis In general these arenâ t widely advertised so you have to ask around They are usually free of charge â the only expectation is that you buy a drink For reggae fans Kingston Dub Club and Dubwise Cafe are the top reggae spots in Kingston The entry fee for both is around JM plus thereâ s a chance your favorite artist will stop by Island wide bars lounges and some restaurants are also sources of great entertainment either free or with a small entry fee These spots usually have karaoke and other themed party nights during the week guaranteed to keep you entertained Travel outside major local holidays If you can be flexible with your travel plans try to visit the island outside of major local holidays such as Christmas New Yearâ s Easter and National Heroes weekend in October During these holidays there is a peak in tourist arrivals so prices of accommodations goods and services tend to increase Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address Subscribe now Subscribe to Lonely Planet
