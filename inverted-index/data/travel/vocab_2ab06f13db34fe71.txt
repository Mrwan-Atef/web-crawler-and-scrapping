Camping with conservationists in Botswana s Okavango Delta A herd of elephants playing in a shallow pan during the Okavango Delta s wet season Photograph by Christiaan Winterbach TRAVEL Camping with conservationists in Botswana s Okavango Delta An Eden for Africa s most famous species Botswana s Okavango Delta offers unrivalled safari experiences even in its dramatic rainy season Photographs by Joe Sills August min read This article was adapted from National Geographic Traveller UK Bouncing with the updrafts in the back of a single engine Cessna I watch the slim shadow of our aeroplane dance across the marbled expanse of the Okavango Delta some below If we go down out here shouts the pilot mischief in his voice you ll be near the bottom of the food chain We swoop over swamplands and lagoons concealing half submerged crocodiles and hippos as the pilot whips the plane into a series of ever steeper banks and turns This makes the flight less like the scenic aerial cruise advertised and more like riding a crop duster through a storm which in many ways proves a fitting introduction to my fortnight in northern Botswana Revived by recent rain showers the Kalahari Desert s shallow clay pools and braided waterways reflect the passing clouds as keenly as quicksilver the palms and plains are electric green It s a version of the Delta that few travellers see as most safari guests choose the country s arid months over this the tail end of the long rainy season We fly lower Beneath one wing of the bobbing aircraft a herd of giraffe ambles towards a vast watering hole beneath the other wildebeest sprint across emerald brushland Feeding this oasis is the Okavango River slicing southwards from Angola quenching these thirsty lands with myriad tributaries destined to finally peter out and soak away into the sandy earth En route the water serves as lifeblood for a menagerie of African species that have earned this region a reputation as one of the richest wildlife enclaves left on Earth Guide Keitopetse Petros Kagande navigates a mopane grove on the outer Okavango Delta while voluntourists look out for wildlife Photograph by Joe Sills Despite the hypnotising tranquillity of the landscape from on high the reality for conservationists at ground level is more fraught All this beauty balances on a knife edge Rising global temperatures are threatening the stability of both natural ecosystems and community life in the Okavango Researchers in Botswana need to know which animals live where how those populations interact with people and where potential pressure points are going to appear And with state sponsored conservation funding in short supply across the region they re increasingly relying on paying voluntourists to help with the manpower needed for data collection Back on the ground at Maun International Airport a generous label applied to a large collection of sun soaked single engine air safari planes and a handful of regional jets a team from voluntourism outfit African Conservation Experience ACE are waiting for me and another incoming volunteer with a four wheel drive We have a three hour mile trip from Maun into the bush ahead of us As a donkey strewn tarmac road crumbles into a rutted sandy track outside town the welcome spiel quickly segues into chatter about the stark realities of my visit The picture for Botswana is this the mean temperature is going to rise by over the next to years warns Christiaan Winterbach an often shoeless wildlife researcher who has been working in the Okavango Delta since the Though Christiaan specialises in lions he s participated in projects that have painted a climate map of the area dating back more than years By studying core samples taken from ancient baobab trees and combining the information with his decades of expertise about the region s apex predators Christiaan has been able to connect the dots between water and wildlife Rainfall in the Angolan Highlands is predicted to be about of its current level in the next three decades he explains painting a future where wild animals livestock and humans will compete for water resources Conservation data collected in the field will play a critical role in striking a new balance A herd of zebras graze in the Okavango Delta During the wet season animal sightings like this typically occur through dense verdant brush Photograph by Margarita Samsonova Time to get to work Four canvas tents Two porcelain toilets One makeshift stove powered by propane We ve arrived at our home for the next two weeks That s a Mozambique spitting cobra booms the voice of our guide Keitopetse Petros Kagande by way of a greeting as we pile out of the four wheel drive He s pointing to a patch of grass through which thin jet black coils are rippling We almost never see snakes out in the open like this This is very lucky he insists sincerely as we walk the short distance to my bunk Our research base sits on the grounds of Mankwe a luxury safari lodge on the eastern fringe of the Delta that s partnered with ACE to provide a base camp for voluntourists working with Christiaan Although guests at Mankwe have access to typical luxury resort amenities our camp is more spartan We cook our own food We take cold showers We bake our own bread in a fireside hole dug into the soil In contrast to the plush cabins at the main lodge our outpost has no wildlife fence and definitely no swimming pool Keitopetse takes great pride in telling me we re the only people camping in an area of square miles The year old professional guide grew up in this area but took a serpentine route to end up in Christiaan s research team When a schoolyard bully forced him out of the educational system Keitopetse was sent to work on a cattle post Unable to benefit from a traditional education he learned English in order to translate his bush knowledge passed down from his parents and grandparents to Western tourists on safari The combined skills were enough to enable him to put more food on the table for his family and get his foot in the door with research projects One of the canvas tents for volunteers at the research camp at Mankwe Photograph by Joe Sills Keitopetse is the leader of our seven person crew there s me Christiaan two British voluntourists a Latvian documentary filmmaker and Tembos Seyamba a Botswanan tracker who s Keitopetse s right hand man Our mission is to travel along the rugged roads of the outer Okavango Delta inching across the terrain while recording animal sightings and predator tracks Typically this is done with Keitopetse shouting at us through the open back window of a Toyota Land Cruiser as Tembos keeps a keen eye on the landscape It only takes a few days to settle into the routine At dawn we fill a lunchbox with apples to snack on and drive to a designated section of dirt road where our data collection begins With the two Botswanans on point the rest of the team ride in the back of the truck learning how to use a rangefinder identify prints and log data Key to the mission is a tablet equipped with GPS and logging software that connects our findings with those of the rest of Christiaan s team As we drive the GPS tracks our location We manually input the species or predator tracks we see I have a gift for spotting guinea fowl it transpires but little else Today starts out like any other While driving along a grass lined fire road we spot a secretary bird eating a puff adder giraffe heads popping up over vegetation tracks from a long gone leopard and a wildebeest careening through a shallow pan of glassy water All animals are logged and will be built into population map models that help conservationists inform their research At each sighting we learn more about the animals and plants that make this part of the Okavango Delta unique We eat native plants We learn the logic behind the behaviour of every animal and we start to understand how transecting making observations along a predetermined straight route is different from your average safari which has no scientific control applied to its movements A spoor chart allows for quick identification of animal tracks Photograph by Melanie Vanzyl Although animal encounters are plentiful Keitopetse refuses to promise us glimpses of Africa s Big Five the combination of lion leopard elephant buffalo and rhino that many travellers look to tick off At high end safari lodges teams of guides work together using radios to swiftly ferry tourists between major sightings but our group works alone in the bush And unlike a conventional safari trip our guides are not tasked with manufacturing wildlife encounters for us The research comes first and what we don t see is as important for the data as what we do see As we crunch through another box of breakfast apples Keitopetse slows the Land Cruiser to a halt on a sandy stretch of road lined by low mopane trees Here he says pointing Lion tracks For days we d scoured massive swathes of brushland in search of signs like this They re fresh The sight of recent prints is enough to send our crew into an uproar The voluntourists bound out from the back of the Land Cruiser we have to get close to the ground for Keitopetse to teach us how to identify prints I snatch up the tablet to log the place where lion paws recently lingered GPS coordinates estimated age and gender and time of the sighting are all swiftly uploaded via satellite As the rest of the team trace the lions activity into the tree line I m left alone to marvel at the scale of prints each as large as my own hand This is the pay off for hard working voluntourists the fruits of a slow safari where science takes the front seat At any sighting on a traditional safari it s highly likely that you re going to have another truck there if not another four or five says fellow voluntourist Julie Reynolds a veteran of luxury safari experiences in Kenya and South Africa Here we re getting moments like this to ourselves We can also move around to get whatever angle we want We can take as long as we want to really watch and absorb the animals The arrival of the annual flood in the Okavango Delta causes river channels to burst their banks saturating floodplains and creating deposits of white sand Photograph by James Gifford Keitopetse and Tembos deduce that the group of lions here were fully grown and rested in the road for a while before making their way into the mopane groves We track the pride s trajectory for a few miles in the Land Cruiser before finding ourselves completely surrounded by dozens of excited grazing elephants gorging themselves on the trees An encounter with a herd this size is entirely new for me and going by Keitopetse s glee a rare occurrence It s a degree panorama of running trumpeting pachyderms While I scramble to retrieve the tablet the herd rumbles past shaking the earth and the trees Thankfully our presence is inconsequential to them a small detail that helps steel mine and Julie s nerves as we quell our adrenaline and document each elephant Today s observations will have significant scientific value for Christiaan When building population maps it s important not only to note the location and time of a sighting but also animal behaviour Are the animals wary of vehicles Are they aggressive or ambivalent Do they react to human presence Our impressions will hopefully inform the routes that safari lodges are encouraged or discouraged from driving in the future They may also help the government decide where livestock grazing areas are allocated My memories of this day will occupy my daydreams for years to come they ll take pride of place among my dinner party anecdotes and flash upon my inner eye during dreary commutes But of far greater and more lasting value is the simple information we collected data that could have implications for the survival of generations of animals to come A yellow billed hornbill searches

and confluence Back at camp Keitopetse pokes at a dubious stir fry thrown together by myself and another member of the team Yes there s conflict between farmers and wildlife he tells me as the African sunset begins to burn orange over our canvas kitchen tent As usual our conversation has turned to the issues facing the Delta Farmers sometimes kill lions that break into corrals and eat their cattle Elephants destroy fields planted for food When they do children have to come home from school to help fix things and they miss out on learning in class The expert guide is not only a spearhead of Christiaan s wildlife monitoring effort he s also a rancher with his own contingent of cattle and goats When water shortages affect the region he ll be one of the first to feel the impact And he knows all too well the ways wildlife can impact local livelihoods although a fence separates the wild Okavango from the nearby farming plots Keitopetse recently lost most of his livestock to a clan of hyenas In a rapidly modernising nation with a growing population like Botswana it s easy to see how some would regard wildlife as an obstacle to enterprise Christiaan whips out a laptop to elaborate on the issue Lions he explains are in the crosshairs of human conflict with lions occurs within miles of conservation areas where the big cats roam beyond fences to find cattle Few get further before they re killed In Botswana two of the main ways of making a living are through livestock and tourism linked to wildlife he says kicking off his sandals and inviting the group to gather around a PowerPoint presentation on his screen For rural people livestock and climate change are going to create competition for water but if we can start planning now we can alleviate some of that problem Tracker Tembos Seyamba foreground and Keitopetse Petros Kagande teach the team how to log a fresh set of leopard prints Photograph by Joe Sills Christiaan s data seeks to provide the people of Botswana with a roadmap to economic solutions before conflict arises As he clicks through slides years of research unfold before us Botswana I learn is home to two of the remaining mega populations of African lion And lions it so happens are a key indicator of the health of the entire ecosystem If there s a disruption in the food chain lions are one place where you can pick up the response very quickly explains Christiaan his voice weighted by the gravity of work ahead to save the species As lions go so goes the ecosystem A night plagued by dreams of barren grasslands and embattled big cats gives way to a glorious dawn While we re out driving in the relative cool of morning a glimmer of gold catches my eye in the rain soaked grass as we bump over a verge Lion I stutter through the open back window slapping my hand on the roof of the Land Cruiser Right there o clock As Keitopetse pumps the brakes I realise I ve finally spotted something that isn t a guinea fowl It s our team s first lion a large adult male the first lion I ve ever seen in the wild The cat glows Its presence triggers a primal reaction in my bones a feeling of both awe and fear In this moment I begin to understand what Christiaan feels is at stake in the Okavango Delta Separated from this radiant beast only by the open side of a pickup truck our team calmly gather the tablets and do what we have been trained to do We log its location we measure its distance from the road We send the information to researchers Then star struck we move on Weeks pass and I m driven back to Maun In the hundreds of miles I ve travelled during my stay with ACE we managed to add an incredible array of wildlife to the log We never did find any more lions but we did see honey badgers caracals leopard tortoises and wild cats By putting ourselves to work for the wildlife we were able to get boots on the ground in a way that drenched these encounters in meaning for me more so I believe than any curated sighting would have done At Maun s Dusty Donkey Cafe a smattering of researchers property developers and miners are dining nearby all percolating with ambitions of saving wildlife building wealth or expanding their portfolios in this far flung corner of Botswana A few hundred yards away the single engine Cessna that introduced me to the Okavango awaits another cluster of tourists searching for a private glimpse of the Delta from the sky My understanding of this paradise has evolved over the weeks spent working alongside ardent conservationists and wildlife trackers What I discovered was a slice of wilderness in desperate need of a helping hand one that anyone who has the time and determination can provide Volunteers learn how to use binoculars and rangefinders to identity individual species and their genders
