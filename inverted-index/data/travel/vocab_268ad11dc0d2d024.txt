Czech Republic Europe Top choice in Staré Město Login Save This museum consists of six Jewish monuments clustered together in Josefov the Maisel Synagogue the Pinkas Synagogue the Spanish Synagogue the Klaus Synagogue the Ceremonial Hall and the Old Jewish Cemetery There is also the Old New Synagogue which is still used for religious services and requires a separate ticket or additional fee In one of the most grotesquely ironic acts of WWII the Nazis took over the management of the Prague Jewish Museum first established in to preserve artefacts from synagogues that were demolished during the slum clearances in Josefov around the turn of the century with the intention of creating a museum of an extinct race They shipped in materials and objects from destroyed Jewish communities throughout Bohemia and Moravia helping to amass what is probably the world s biggest collection of sacred Jewish artefacts and a moving memorial to seven centuries of oppression An ordinary ticket gives admission to all six main monuments You can buy tickets at the Reservation Centre the Pinkas Synagogue the Spanish Synagogue and the shop opposite the entrance to the Old New Synagogue Queues tend to be shortest at the Spanish Synagogue If you are pressed for time the highlights are the Old New Synagogue and the Old Jewish Cemetery Completed around the Old New Synagogue is Europe s oldest working synagogue and one of Prague s earliest Gothic buildings You step down into it because it predates the raising of Staré Město s street level in medieval times to guard against floods Men must cover their heads a hat or bandanna will do paper yarmulkes are handed out at the entrance Around the central chamber are an entry hall a winter prayer hall and the room from which women watch the men only services The interior with a pulpit surrounded by a century wrought iron grill looks much as it would have years ago The century scriptures on the walls were recovered from beneath a later restoration On the eastern wall is the Holy Ark that holds the Torah scrolls In a glass case at the rear little light bulbs beside the names of the prominent deceased are lit on their death days With its steep roof and Gothic gables this looks like a place with secrets and at least one version of the Golem legend ends here Left alone on the Sabbath the creature runs amok Rabbi Loew rushes out in the middle of a service removes its magic talisman and carries the lifeless body into the synagogue s attic where some insist it still lies Across the narrow street is the elegant century High Synagogue Vysoká synagóga so called because its prayer hall closed to the public is upstairs Around the corner is the Jewish Town Hall Židovská radnice built by Mordechai Maisel in and given its rococo facade in the century It has a clock tower with one Hebrew face where the hands like the Hebrew script run backwards It s closed to the public The handsome Pinkas Synagogue was built in and used for worship until After WWII it was converted into a memorial with wall after wall inscribed with the names birth dates and dates of disappearance of the Czech victims of the Nazis It also has a collection of paintings and drawings by children held in the Terezín concentration camp during WWII The Pinkas Synagogue contains the entrance to the Old Jewish Cemetery Europe s oldest surviving Jewish graveyard Founded in the early century it has a palpable atmosphere of mourning even after more than two centuries of disuse it was closed in Remember however that this is one of Prague s most popular sights so if you re hoping to have a moment of quiet contemplation you ll probably be disappointed Around crumbling stones some brought from other long gone cemeteries are heaped together but beneath them are perhaps graves piled in layers because of the lack of space The most prominent graves marked by pairs of marble tablets with a roof between them are near the main gate among them are the graves of Mordechai Maisel and Rabbi Loew The oldest stone now replaced by a replica is that of Avigdor Karo a chief rabbi and court poet to Wenceslas IV who died in Most stones bear the name of the deceased and his or her father the date of death and sometimes of burial and poetic texts Elaborate markers from the and centuries are carved with bas reliefs some of them indicating the deceased s occupation look out for a pair of hands marking the grave of a pianist Since the cemetery was closed Jewish burials have taken place at the Jewish Cemetery in Žižkov There are remnants of another old Jewish burial ground at the foot of the TV Tower in Žižkov You exit the cemetery through a gate between the Klaus Synagogue Klausová Synagóga and the Ceremonial Hall Obřadní síň both of which house exhibitions on Jewish forms of worship family ceremonies and traditions such as birth circumcision bar mitzvah and marriage A block to the southeast lies the neo Gothic Maisel Synagogue which replaced a Renaissance original built by Mordechai Maisel mayor of the Jewish community in It houses an exhibit on the history of the Jews in Bohemia and Moravia from the to the centuries with displays of ceremonial silver textiles prints and books Finally about two blocks east of the Maisel is the Spanish Synagogue Named after its striking Moorish interior and dating from its exhibit
