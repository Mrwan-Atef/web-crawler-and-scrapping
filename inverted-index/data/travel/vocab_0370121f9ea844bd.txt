Kerry Murray for Lonely Planet Indulge in conventual sweets Egg yolks sugar and occasionally almonds are the core ingredients of typical Portuguese pastries known as conventual sweets Cloistered nuns and monks hence the name conventual created these concoctions making use of extra egg yolks the whites were exported and used in winemaking and newly imported sugar from Brazil in the century Initially these treats were for residents consumption But in the century when religious orders were all to be dissolved these sweet creations became their only source of income as convents and monasteries were forced to stop taking in novices Advertisement Each region of Portugal has its traditional conventual sweet with some local or seasonal ingredients thrown in the mix such as beans in the pastel de feijÃ o i n Torres Vedras or the paper thin wafer encased ovos moles in Aveiro Pastel de nata custard tarts are Lisbon s most famous conventual sweet and also the one that s seen the most variations including vegan alternatives Party at Santos Populares local saints festivals Traditional or popular saints festivities Santos Populares happen all over Portugal in June but St Anthony s in Lisbon on June and St John s in Porto on June are the best known In these cities historical neighborhoods locals hang colorful ribbons across the narrow cobblestoned streets and set up charcoal grills to cook sardines and pork steaks preferably washed down with a cold local beer or house wine These festivals started as a way to honor the communities patron saints but nowadays it s the perfect excuse to meet local residents share a meal and dance the night away NazarÃ is known for the best big wave surfing in Portugal Shutterstock Surf or watch the giant waves in NazarÃ The giant Atlantic waves that roll in during NazarÃ s rough winters were no secret to local surfers and fishers but when North American surfer Garrett McNamara established a new World Record by riding a wave in

Fort is one of the most photographed in town Celebrate Carnaval all over Portugal For three days before Ash Wednesday in February or early March kids and grownups dress up in costumes and participate in Carnaval parades and celebrations happening all over Portugal The first celebrations can be traced back to the century when some of ancient Rome s pagan festivities were appropriated by the Catholic Church Nearly every town around Portugal hosts a Carnaval parade on Fat Tuesday the last day of Carnaval but some are more iconic than others Torres Vedras Ovar and LoulÃ are home to the best Carnaval celebrations and they mix local traditions with Brazilian inspired samba parades Local tip Can t make it to Portugal for Fat Tuesday There is an alternative In Podence a small village in Portugal s northwest Carnaval is celebrated differently from the rest of the country Here it s a unique end of winter celebration that inherited the pagan traditions of former Celtic settlers and is

commercial routes the mountain villages between Coimbra and Castelo Branco were practically deserted in the mid century as locals migrated elsewhere in Europe The dark schist stones used to build the
