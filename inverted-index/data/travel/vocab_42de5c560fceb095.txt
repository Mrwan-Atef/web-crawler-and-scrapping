Ballet founded in relax outside their Casa del Prado studio and performance space in Balboa Park Photograph by Kris Davidson By Maryellen Kennedy Duckett Photographs by Kris Davidson October When someone comes to visit me the first place I take them is Balboa Park Aside from all of the museums and countless things to do and see like the San Diego Zoo the park is vast peaceful It s just beautiful to stroll through with its varied gardens and Spanish Colonial Revival architecture Any time is the best time to visit my town because there is perfect weather pretty much year round Life is lived outdoors in San Diego Even the little bit of Southern California morning fog and clouds we get in late spring doesn t keep anyone indoors The best views in my town are from the coastal lookouts at Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve Take the Beach Trail which is relatively short and yet nothing short of magical You get stunning views of the Pacific and the cliffs plus steps leading down to the ocean for a refreshing dip Nestled in San Diego s North Park neighborhood airy Pigment carries a carefully curated collection of home furnishings plants kitchen utensils and products from local makers Photograph by Kris Davidson Top Left and Photograph by Kris Davidson Bottom Right Spanish Village Art Center in Balboa Park is the place to buy authentic local souvenirs You can watch local artisans like potters painters metalsmiths basket makers at work in their studios and buy one of a kind art and craft Commonly called The Nat the San Diego Natural History Museum in Balboa Park features four floors of exhibitions showcasing the natural history and biodiversity of Southern California and the Baja California peninsula Photograph by Kris Davidson My town s best museum is the San Diego Natural History Museum in Balboa Park The upper mezzanine of the Extraordinary Ideas from Ordinary People A History of Citizen Science exhibit always has rare books from the museum s research library One really old book recently on display had handwritten reference notes on mythical sea dragons which I loved very Harry Potter ish The best place to spend time outdoors in my town is everywhere The occasional palm tree decorated for Christmas in December is the only indicator of a seasonal shift It truly is an endless summer here and many San Diegans own more swimsuits than underwear My town really knows how to celebrate Mexican culture It s not overt more of an effortless elegance that s woven in The edge of America both by sea and land border is beautiful and culturally textured in a way that defies words and is undoubtedly far more relaxing than one might imagine Catching a wave at Sunset Cliffs Natural Park in Point Loma requires navigating rocky and rugged coastal terrain Photograph by Kris Davidson You can tell if someone is from my town if they walk down the street barefoot particularly close to the beach Getting there is half the fun at False Idol the vintage tiki bar speakeasy hidden within the Craft Commerce gastropub in San Diego s Little Italy neighborhood Photograph by Kris Davidson Winemaker Ross Rizzo Jr continues his family s three generation Italian wine producing tradition at San Diego s Bernardo Winery established in and owned and operated by the Rizzo family since Photograph by Kris Davidson For a fancy night out I head to Little Italy for a really nice dinner at either Craft and Commerce or Ironside After that it s onto the Gaslamp Quarter for drinks at Fifth Rose the elegant cocktail bar at the Pendry hotel Just outside my town you can visit the Bernardo Winery Southern California s oldest family owned and operated winery You could spend the whole day There s a tasting room shop artists studios and great coffee At Andaz San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter one of the best places to watch the sunset is the rooftop pool and bar called The Rooftop by STK Located next to the San Diego Zoo the popular Balboa Park Carousel features a menagerie of hand carved animals Photograph by Kris Davidson One of the best ways to feel like a kid again in my town is riding the Balboa Park Carousel It has a two level platform and all the different animal figures such as horses ostriches zebras pigs and frogs are the hand carved originals Sit on the outside row to try to grab one of the brass rings The best outdoor market in my town is the Little Italy Mercato Farmers Market It s on Saturdays year round and a great place to buy fresh locally grown produce For more ethnic foods and crafts check out Fair on Saturdays in City Heights Also on Saturday I really love going down to the Tuna Harbor Dockside Market to see what s fresh They have great chefs there preparing sandwiches and tacos from whatever the catch was that day To find out what s going on at night and on the weekends look at meetup websites You can join all sorts of groups for hikes kayaking camping beach volleyball and other activities and events The beach is another a great place to meet new people and discover what s happening Locals are friendly and very easy going Just go down to the beach and make friends A contingent of Disney princesses take a break from the buzzing convention scene at San Diego s annual Comic Con International Photograph by Kris Davidson My town s signature festival is Comic Con You might not realize it but Comic Con was born in San Diego Even if you re not into superheroes comics or science fiction fantasy the costumes people wear are pretty amazing An experience embodying the spirit of my town is gathering around a fire on the beach at sunset This local business called Beach Fire Guy will set up the fire and do all the work The dish that represents my city best is fish tacos made with locally caught fish Try them any chance you get anywhere you are because people in San Diego take a lot of pride in making a good fish taco It is fun to see how different venues interpret the same dish I love the fish tacos batter dipped white fish filet topped with cabbage chiffonade onion and white cream sauce from the Taco Tuesday food truck Only in San Diego would a German engineer dig a tunnel to a sea cave La Jolla s Sunny Jim Cave from his living room Related Topics TOURISM You May Also Like TRAVEL How to eat your way through San Diego like a local TRAVEL San Diego California s culture capital
