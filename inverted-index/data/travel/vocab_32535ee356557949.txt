in history at the turn of the century The image of early Alaska set to the harsh tunes of countless honky tonk saloons and the clanging of pans is rooted around the Interior s goldfields Gold fever struck in Circle and Eagle in the spread into Canada s Yukon Territory in the big Klondike gold rush of headed as far west as the beaches of Nome in then came back to Alaska s Interior when Fairbanks hit pay dirt in Through it all the broad swift Yukon River was the rush s main highway Flowing almost miles from Canada to the Bering Sea just below the Arctic Circle it carried prospectors across the north in search of instant fortune Although Fairbanks has grown into a bustling city with some serious attractions many towns and communities in the Interior seem little changed from the gold rush days Visiting the galleries at the Morris Thompson Cultural and Visitors Center makes it clear how intertwined the Interior s past and present lifestyles remain When early missionaries set up schools in the Bush the Alaska Native peoples were sent to regional centers for schooling and salvation but that stopped long ago and today Interior Alaska s Native villages are thriving with their own schools and a particularly Alaskan blend of modern life and tradition Ft Yukon miles northeast of Fairbanks on the Arctic Circle is the largest Athabascan village in the state with just less than residents Alaska s current gold rush the pipeline carrying a little less each year black gold from the oil fields in Prudhoe Bay south to the port of Valdez snakes its way through the Interior The

Territory to the world s attention with the Klondike gold rush of Maybe as many as people set off for the confluence of the Yukon and Klondike rivers on the promise of nuggets the size of basketballs just waiting to be picked up In the end roughly only a dozen of them actually went home rich in gold but all who returned did so rich in memories and stories that are still being told Though the international border divides Alaska from Yukon Territory the Yukon River tends to unify the region Early prospectors miners traders and camp followers moved readily up and down the river with little regard to national boundaries An earlier Alaska strike preceded the Klondike find by years yet Circle was all but abandoned in the stampede to the creeks around Dawson City and Whitehorse Later gold discoveries in the Alaskan Fortymile Country Nome and Fairbanks reversed that flow across the border into Alaska Guidebooks for Every Journey Fodor s Alaska Buy Now See All Guideboks Fodor s The
