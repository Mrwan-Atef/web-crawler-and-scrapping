activities to keep the little ones happy in Budapest Advertisement Budapest has plenty of kid friendly parks museums and attractions Â martin dm iStockphoto Getty Images Is Budapest good for kids While Budapest s architecture and history will keep adults enthralled with kids in tow you may need to go beyond the must sees to keep the entertainment levels dialed up to The good news is that Budapest s famous thermal waters offer fun for the whole family and there are plenty of kid friendly parks museums and attractions Budapest has a very good reliable and well connected public transport system so thereâ s no need to rent a car or take a taxi even with little ones Trams buses and metro trains can take you absolutely everywhere â you can get from downtown to the top of Budapest in

than buses or the metro Note that several boat lines form part of the public transport system and can be used with a travel pass making for a cheap river cruise Where is best in Budapest for kids Budapest is made up of calmer quieter Buda on the west bank of the Danube and lively buzzing Pest on the east bank with the outlying settlement of Ã buda merging into the northern fringes of Buda The inner city is fairly compact however and there isn t one specific neighborhood that stands out for families when it comes to picking accommodations Many local families live on the Buda side but staying here will put you further from the big sights and you ll have fewer choices when it comes to accommodations We recommend staying on the Pest side to be within walking distance of the top sights and make getting around much easier Avoid inner District when booking your accommodation â this is Budapest s party district and it overflows with noisy tourists and bachelor parties in summer

four seater wheelie bike for the whole family to pedal around the island â cars are banned so apart from the island bus and meandering bikes thereâ s no traffic on the main road Make your way to the

Bridge Of the big historic thermal baths the GellÃ rt Baths admits children but the pools are only recommended for kids over years of age because of concerns about the effects of the hot water on
