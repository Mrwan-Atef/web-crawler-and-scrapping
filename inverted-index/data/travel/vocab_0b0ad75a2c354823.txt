the main entry point to the capital Reykjavik The most recent was on November though flights are unaffected and operating normally so far in The town of Grindavik was initially evacuated due to the

waters at Ã ingvellir National Park for a dare and witnessed tourists being sucked into the waves at black sand beach one of Iceland s best Though Iceland s dramatic terrain can be perilous there are usually no safety rails beside cliff edges and no ropes alongside plummeting waterfalls Icelanders prefer not to mar beauty with obvious signs or railings instead they rely on people to be aware of their surroundings and mindful of potential danger If there are signs or barriers heed them Icelandic lagoon dotted with icebergs reflects the colors of the sky Ondrej Senk Shutterstock Plan ahead before taking a road trip Having your own wheels in Iceland is a wonderful treat it allows you to roam the grand countryside at your leisure But it s important to be prepared before setting out â investigate driving times and road conditions via the Icelandic Road Administration weather forecasts safety issues and if you re walking in nature trail conditions and requirements Plan an itinerary

road It s illegal and incredibly damaging to the fragile environment Cavalier tourists leave tracks where they ve flouted the rule and those tracks entice others to do the same Even with a stick to marked roads Always shower with soap before taking a dip in hot springs Part of the unique gift of Iceland s volcanic landscape is the natural hot springs you ll find from the town center to the fjord side It s practically a national pastime to hit the local spring soak and gossip It is however an absolute mandatory hygiene and etiquette rule to wash thoroughly with soap before donning your swimsuit to enter the hot springs and pools Most pools are untreated with chemicals so cleanliness is a real factor Whether you re at the famous Blue Lagoon or the remote Krossneslaug there s no quicker way to disgust an Icelander than to jump in dirty You should also take your shoes off and put them on the rack provided as you enter the changing room Iceland Fast Phrases Pack proper outdoor gear and equipment for hiking Bring good maps and appropriate gear plus you ve heard it before common sense is key Consult a proper hiking or cold weather packing list Consider this â if you had no access to a car or building would you be warm and dry enough in what you are wearing Never go hiking in jeans don t climb on glaciers without proper guidance don t try fording rivers in subcompact cars and don t go camping without hardcore waterproof tents With proper gear you can relax and enjoy all that beauty no worries required Being prepared can open up great wilderness areas such as the Westfjords beautiful Hornstrandir Nature Reserve known for its Arctic foxes spectacular birding cliffs and unspoiled hiking and camping If you need additional equipment once in Iceland ReykjavÃ k has
