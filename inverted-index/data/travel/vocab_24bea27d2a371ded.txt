Sydney Harbor bridge climb don t need to break the bank Alberto Mazza Sydney is not a cheap city to visit For starters unless you re already nearby flights alone are incredibly expensive Then of course you ll need to factor in the cost of accommodation transportation food and drink and activities Advertisement Luckily there are some ways to make your Aussie dollars go further in Sydney Avoid visiting during the peak holiday seasons Use public transport Plan picnic meals at city parks by the harbor or at the beach And make the most of free things to do from art galleries and museums to public festivals Here are our top tips on visiting Sydney on a budget along with a guide to daily costs A guide to daily costs in Sydney Hostel bed in shared room AUD to AUD USD to USD Basic room for two AUD to AUD USD to USD Self catering apartment including Airbnb AUD USD Unlimited daily travel on transport AUD USD Coffee AUD USD Sandwich AUD USD Dinner for two AUD to AUD USD to USD Beer at the pub AUD USD Average daily cost to USD to USD including three meals a day and modest accommodation and activities Pick a hostel for the best budget sleep Sydney is generally not a bargain city to stay in but there are accommodations that fit different budgets At the more affordable end of the spectrum there are a few excellent hostel options â like the Sydney Harbour YHA In the midrange field Sydney is winning at super hip boutique hotels that are as friendly and charming as they are cool Yes theyâ re not cheap but then you wonâ t want to leave hotels like these with unique features like gorgeous architecture rooftop decks and even a basement cinema at Paramount Hotel You ll find smaller less expensive hotels further from the city center in Kings Cross Glebe and at the beaches but in those cases you ll have to factor in travel time and costs Visit outside the Australian school holidays The most expensive times to stay in Sydney are during the Australian holidays particularly the Australian summer December to February plus Easter and the late September school holidays Winter June to August is when youâ ll find hotel deals that offer options to â pay for two nights but stay three â While it may not get very cold in Sydney during winter the sun goes down early leaving less time for many of Sydneyâ s most memorable experiences like kayaking in the harbor learning to surf and walking its stunning headlands To save on meals grab takeout from a market or grocer and enjoy it al fresco Jean Jacques Halans Getty Images Picnic with a view instead of dining in Looking at a menu with mains starting at may make your eyes water but when you consider the quality of the produce the professionalism of the hospitality staff and in many cases the gorgeous surroundings â that dinner may end up being one of the most memorable meals of your life It s important to consider the entire value of a meal out when you re reservation hunting while traveling It s also worth noting that menu pricing always includes tax and tip Advertisement Sydney is dotted with metro style supermarkets and small grocers with mouth watering produce from fresh fruit and vegetables to delicious deli treats Enjoy the sights and sounds of browsing these markets and scoop up a picnic style meal to be eaten al fresco Sydney has hundreds of perfect spots to dine for free many with million dollar views â from Mrs Macquarie s Chair to North Head at the entrance to Syndey Harbor or a shady spot at the Royal Botanic Garden Get an Opal card and use Sydneyâ s public transport Sydney has an excellent public transport system called Opal which includes frequent buses trains light rail trams and harbor ferries NightRide buses run after midnight delivering transport on some train and bus routes Rather than booking an expensive harbor cruise take it all in on the Manly ferry or ride the Parramatta River ferry upstream via Olympic Park Get an Opal card and pay a maximum of USD per day for transport in Sydney and USD for children to years old Weekends are cheaper although there are fewer services available Caps on weekly trips for adults are USD kids is USD Do the Sydney Harbour Bridge experience on a budget The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a bucket list climbing experience worth the price tag But for those of us who canâ t afford the climb thereâ s the Pylon Lookout and Museum which has a related experience for a fraction of the cost Here you can learn about the bridge s history before climbing one of the four pylons for some decent harbor views If you want something completely free walking across the bridge between Milsons Point and The Rocks on the pedestrian walkway wonâ t cost you a cent Itâ s accessed via a staircase at either end of the bridge You can always admire it as you whiz by on a ferry back to Circular Quay Get a combo pass for big ticket attractions If youâ re planning to see multiple big ticket attractions like Madame Tussauds Sydney Tower Eye Sea Life Sydney Aquarium and Wild Life Sydney Zoo youâ ll save on entrance fees with a combo ticket of two three or four attractions within days You can buy these online before you visit and all attractions are close to one another so you may even tick them off in one day if you start early General admission to the Art Gallery of NSW is free Oliver Strewe Getty Images Find out what you can do for next to nothing Many museums and galleries offer free admission to all or part of their collections including top attractions such as the Art Gallery of NSW Rocks Discovery Museum Maritime Museum White Rabbit and the Museum of Contemporary Art by Circular Quay There are loads of other Sydney activities you can do for free such as snorkeling at the beach or stargazing at Barrenjoey Lighthouse to stretch your budget further while seeing the best of Sydney Check out what festivals and events are on when youâ re in town Thereâ s almost always some cultural event happening with free or low cost activities from the spectacle of Vivid in winter to the drama of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race heading off on Boxing Day Add a DIY walking tour to your plans If you can fit at least one fully guided tour into your travel budget we highly recommend local tours particularly an Aboriginal cultural tour where you will learn about the Gadigal people and more about Sydney After that if youâ re still itching to see more there are many self guided walking tours to look up that will help you explore Sydneyâ s history â wild sideâ and eclectic architecture Check out the City of Sydney culture walks app for more than walking tours Sunset cocktails with spectacular views don t have to be expensive if you know where to go Stephen Bridger Getty Images Find cheaper places for sunset view beers and cocktails Is that iconic drink with incredible Sydney views one of your must do Sydney experiences If the minimum bar spend at the ultra luxury Crown Towers rooftop bar CIRQ feels just out of budget donâ t fret although if we could we would You have options Order a glass of wine at O Lounge Bar atop Sydney Tower walk ins allowed or down a signature cocktail from Blu Bar at the Shangri La Hotel in The Rocks while watching the sunset to the west of Sydney Harbour Bridge If you want views but donâ t want to get out of your shorts and sandals head to Harbour View Hotel in The Rocks Perched right next to the Sydney Harbour Bridge you can sip an ice cold beer on the rooftop of this pub while spotting ferries slinking under the bridge Get a GST refund before you go A goods and services tax GST is automatically added to almost everything you buy in Australia If you purchase goods with a minimum total value of USD from any one shop within days of departure from Australia the Tourist Refund Scheme entitles you to a refund of any GST paid Keep your receipts and carry the items on board your flight as hand luggage or get them checked before you check them in you can get a refund at the designated booth located past Customs at Sydney airport Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address
