read Share People are always on the move in Tokyo and there are many transportation options to get around the city Â JohnnyGreig Getty Images Given that Tokyo is the most populated city on earth it needs a transport system that s up to the task of moving millions of people around daily Fortunately the public transportation in Japan s capital is efficient reliable clean and generally safe â it makes getting around the region a breeze Of most use to travelers is the train and subway system which is simple to navigate thanks to English signage and color coded lines â even if some large stations most notably Shinjuku can be a maze for the uninitiated But donâ t feel obliged to use trains for every journey Despite unpredictable traffic patterns buses tend to be equally punctual and can be useful for short journeys in quieter suburbs Tokyoâ s relatively flat topography also means cycling and walking donâ t require too much of a sweat and allow you to explore neighborhoods youâ d otherwise bypass on the underground And if you want to combine your commute with sightseeing take to the river on one of Tokyoâ s beetle like water buses which travel between mainland Tokyo and the reclaimed islands of Tokyo Bay This is everything you need to know about getting around Tokyo Advertisement The Shinkansen bullet train is an incredible way to see Japan Â gui jun peng Shutterstock Tokyo s trains and subway system get you around quickly Tokyoâ s extensive rail network includes Japan Railways JR lines a subway system and private commuter lines that depart in every direction for the suburbs like spokes on a wheel Journeys that require transfers between lines run by different operators cost more than journeys that use a single operatorâ s lines Major transit hubs include Tokyo Shinagawa Shibuya Shinjuku Ikebukuro and Ueno stations â all connected via the JR Yamanote Line that circles the Imperial Palace Tokyoâ s central point Trains arrive and depart precisely on time and are generally clean and pleasant though they get uncomfortably crowded during rush hours and late at night for a short window in the morning and early evenings many trains have women only carriages The city s trains stop running between midnight and give or take an hour depending on the line while many bars clubs karaoke rooms and izakaya gastro pubs remain in business until the wee hours or even It s wise to check when your last train departs or be prepared to find another more expensive means of transport home The JR network covers the whole country and includes the Shinkansen bullet train In Tokyo the above ground Yamanote loop and the ChÅ Å â SÅ bu central lines are the most useful Tickets start at Â and go up depending on how far you travel Tokyo has subway lines nine of which are operated by Tokyo Metro and four by Toei The lines are color coded making navigation fairly simple â although a transfer ticket is required to change between the two networks A Pasmo or Suica card makes this process seamless but either way a journey involving more than one operator comes out costing slightly more Fares depend on the distance traveled A rail pass makes travel more convenient and saves you money Â YingHui Liu Shutterstock Grab a transport pass for seamless travel in Tokyo Referred to generally as IC cards or IC passes prepaid rechargeable Suica and Pasmo cards work on all city trains subways and buses you can also use passes purchased in other regions of Japan such as the Icoca from western Japan or the Kitaka from HokkaidÅ Buy these from any touch screen ticket vending machine in Tokyo including those at Haneda and Narita airports most have an English option and the cards are interchangeable JR stations sell Suica and subway and independent lines sell Pasmo Both require a Â deposit which is refunded along with any remaining balance when you return the pass to any ticket window Passes can be topped up at any touch screen ticket vending machine not just for example at JR stations for Suica passes in increments of Â Unfortunately a shortage of chips has resulted in a supply failure of the physical cards and they re now hard to find in Tokyo iPhone users can use a digital IC card through their Apple Pay function and there are tourist specific cards available at the airports These have a much shorter expiry date than the regular cards â days versus years If you still have an IC card from your last trip to Tokyo it will work fine if it s less than years old If youâ re planning a packed day you might consider getting an unlimited ride ticket The Tokyo Subway Ticket allows unlimited rides on both Tokyo Metro and Toei subway lines with hour hour and hour options available This pass is only available to foreign travelers on a tourist visa youâ ll need to determine whether the trains you plan to use will be largely JR or metro to get your moneyâ s worth Using IC cards is simple just run them over the card readers at the ticket gates upon entering and exiting Fares for pass users are slightly less a few yen per journey than for paper ticket holders The bus service in Tokyo is punctual and you get to see the city as you travel Â B S P I Getty Images See more of Tokyo on a bus Toei runs an extensive bus network in Tokyo though itâ s only more convenient than the subway when youâ re in the outer suburbs or making short inner city jaunts A particularly useful bus the number connects Shibuya Hiroo and Azabujuban â three popular cosmopolitan neighborhoods Fares are Â for adults and Â for children there are no transfer tickets Pay by IC pass or deposit your fare into the box as you enter the bus â if your pass is out of credit you can charge it at the front of the bus the word for â chargeâ is cha ji Thereâ s also a change machine by the driverâ s seat that accepts Â notes Most buses have digital signage that switches between Japanese and English otherwise listen for your stop Signal the bus to stop in advance of the approaching stop by pushing one of the buttons near your seat Advertisement Japan is a global leader in hydrogen energy one of the worldâ s cleanest energy sources which emits only wastewater even if some question the technologyâ s cost effectiveness Some hydrogen fuel cell buses have been in operation since March traveling primarily between Tokyo Station and the Tokyo Big Sight convention center in Ariake while passing through the popular Yurakucho Ginza and Tsukiji neighborhoods The local government is aiming to have more than hydrogen buses in operation by Get a fresh view from a water bus Tokyoâ s â water busesâ look like robotic beetles skimming across the placid waters of its eastern river networks Thanks to their glass walled exteriors theyâ re a great option for taking in the sights of Tokyo Bay while traveling between Asakusa and the likes of Odaiba Toyosu and Hama rikyÅ Gardens Journeys will cost between Â and Â depending on distance and are generally more comfortable than their terrestrial public transport counterparts Taxis make sense for short distances in Tokyo Â sack Getty Images After a late night out consider a taxi Getting a taxi in Tokyo only makes economic sense for short distances or when in groups of four â unless youâ re stranded during the lull in nightly train operations All cabs run by the meter with fares starting at Â for the first miles and then rising by Â for every you travel or for every seconds spent in traffic When traveling longer distances this starts to add up at a rather alarming rate especially when you factor in the nighttime surcharge of between and and potential highway tolls Drivers rarely speak English though most taxis have navigation systems Have your destination written down in Japanese â or better yet a business card with an address Most taxis now also take credit cards and IC passes since the pandemic began many have introduced automated payment systems attached to screens on the back of the main passenger seat Train stations and hotels have designated taxi stands In the absence of a stand you can hail a cab from the street by standing on the curb and sticking your arm out there are typically far more taxis roaming the streets than punters hailing them down Local tips for using cabs and finding addresses Japanese cab doors are automatic and even after years of residence in the city many foreigners find themselves struggling to open self opening doors Exercise patience Once in the taxi youâ ll notice how difficult Tokyoâ s streets are to navigate even for locals Only the biggest streets have official names and they donâ t figure into addresses Instead addresses are derived from districts blocks and building numbers Central Tokyo is divided first into ku wards â Tokyo has of them which in turn are divided into chÅ or machi towns and then into numbered districts called chÅ me pronounced â cho mayâ Subsequent numbers in an address refer to blocks within the chÅ me and buildings within each block Since itâ s nearly impossible to find your destination using the address alone smartphones with navigation apps have been a real boon Many restaurants and venues also have useful maps on their websites If you get lost police officers at kÅ ban police boxes have maps and can help with directions though few speak English At the very least they should be able to steer you back to the nearest train station from where you can try again Many businesses have also started using the app which has divided the world into square grids to help users pinpoint a specific location Uber does operate in Tokyo but it s not cheaper Uber arrived in Tokyo in May though its boutique chauffeur service Uber Black dates back to The ride share company has partnered with three local taxi operators to provide rides in Tokyoâ s central business district and other busy areas Even though Tokyo strictly regulates ride sharing apps other competitors are entering the market such as the cityâ s premier taxi app JapanTaxi which isnâ t particularly tourist friendly Given Uberâ s unpredictable availability and a pricing structure similar to that of street cabs there are few occasions where using the app is merited Stick to city parks rather than roads when cycling in Tokyo Â Alexander Spatari Getty Images Cycling in Tokyo At first glance Tokyo doesnâ t seem like a bicycle friendly city dedicated lanes are almost nonexistent on major thoroughfares cyclists often come up against pedestrian overpasses that need to be scaled though a few have ramps for walking bikes up and down and youâ ll see no parking signs for bicycles everywhere Despite all this youâ ll also see plenty of pedaling locals This is because Tokyo is a largely flat city and much bike friendlier if youâ re cycling through city parks in residential neighborhoods along the river promenades near Tokyo Bay or around the maze of backstreets Cogi Cogi is a bike sharing system with ports around the city including some hostels Despite instructions in English the system is a little complicated to use youâ ll need to download an app register a credit card and have a wi fi connection on the go to sync with the ports Driving in Tokyo is generally not worth the hassle Â Jerry Driendl Getty Images Think twice about hiring a car Considering the traffic the confusing and often excruciatingly narrow roads and the ridiculous cost of parking itâ s best not to use a car to get around Tokyo even most Tokyoties donâ t bother owning a vehicle Day trips can easily be done by public transport though renting a car will expand your options and allow you to explore regions rarely visited by the touring masses For rentals you will need an International Driving Permit which must be arranged in your own country before you leave certain conditions must be met see the Japan Automobile Federation website for further information Rental companies with branches around the city include Nippon Rent a Car and Toyota Rent a Car Local tips for car rentals in Tokyo Rental cars are generally affordable especially when the cost is split among passengers and are economical with respect to gas mileage That said highway tolls in Japan can be exorbitant â driving to Osaka and back for example would cost over Â in toll fees mitigating some of the money saved on skipping the bullet train Also be sure to pay the extra fee for damage insurance In the event that you are in an accident no matter how small you must first call the police to record the incident before the vehicle is returned to the shop or youâ ll risk incurring hair raising financial penalties Rental operators are fairly unsympathetic to those who donâ t follow these rules itâ s worth bringing a translator to go through the small print to avoid any such mishaps Accessible transportation in Tokyo Tokyo is working hard to improve universal access â or bariafurÄ â barrier freeâ ã ã ªã ã ã ªã in Japanese Itâ s estimated that at least of Tokyoâ s approximately train stations have step free facilities and accessible toilets while of buses are also wheelchair accessible Newer buildings have wheelchair access ramps more and more subway stations are introducing elevators look for signs on the platform as not all exits have them and yellow braille lines direct visually impaired passengers through major stations and guide them safely along platforms Train station staff will also help wheelchair using passengers on and off trains with a temporary slope A fair number of hotels from the higher end of midrange and up offer a barrier free room or two be sure to book well in advance Note that what constitutes â barrier freeâ is not always consistent so check the details carefully Larger attractions department stores and shopping malls
