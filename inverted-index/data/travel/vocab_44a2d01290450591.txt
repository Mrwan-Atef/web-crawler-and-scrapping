Getty Images By Angela Locatelli May This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Lake Como conveys notions of easy elegance and the Italian art of slow living and has come to stand for something bigger than it is Officially called Lario Italy s third biggest lake has been drawing visitors since the century when it was a popular stop for European nobles on their grand tours More recently it stepped into the spotlight as the backdrop for films including Ocean s Twelve and Casino Royale But the lake s prestige dates to Roman times when Julius Ceasar drained a swamp at its southwestern end strategically located near Alpine passes and funded the creation of a city known as Novum Comum It laid the foundation for Como the main hub to this day which gave Lario its more popular nickname This spring is the best time to visit the city in over a decade as sections of its waterfront sidewalks which had been cordoned off for expansion since are once again open to walkers The centre is dominated by the azure dome of the Duomo di Como one of the last gothic cathedrals built in the country Behind it is Teatro Sociale and to one side is the shopping street of Via Vittorio Emanuele II It s a good place to pick up a souvenir mulberry trees were planted on Lake Como s hills in the century and boutiques like A Picci sell handkerchiefs and scarves using their silk Next to the shop Via Lambertenghi leads to Via Alessandro Volta named after the physicist credited as the inventor of the electric battery The townhouse where he was born in is marked with a plaque and around it are some of the most coveted addresses of the time This is not least thanks to their giardini pensili gardens built on the Roman walls that once guarded the city centre Equally evocative is Passeggiata Lino Gelpi between the lake and shorefront private gardens The path s name pays tribute to the century mayor who reclaimed a strip of land from villa owners to pave Como s most scenic public footpaths It s a front row spot from which to watch the lake s seaplanes land and it s especially lovely in spring when wisteria blooms along the banks Continue walking along the waterside road for half an hour to Cernobbio one of the lake s most popular resorts Local Comaschi come to eat at Harry s Bar in a piazza by the shore it serves whitefish from the lake but the pick is the sole
