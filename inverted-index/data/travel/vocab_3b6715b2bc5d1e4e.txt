Discovering an unexpected wilderness on Wisconsin s Ice Age Trail Wisconsin s Ice Age Trail a nationally designated scenic trail winds along the remnants of ancient glacial activity including Devils Lake Photograph by Jacqueline Kehoe TRAVEL Discovering an unexpected wilderness on Wisconsin s Ice Age Trail Kept home by the pandemic one writer explores a glacial history in her own backyard By Jacqueline Kehoe Photographs by Jacqueline Kehoe June min read It s a strange thing to believe that where you re from doesn t really have a great outdoors The Midwest s prairies limestone bluffs and river valleys that s just Land That Can t Quite Be Farmed A reflection of the wild maybe but not wild itself Above Colorado s alpine tree lines amongst Utah s shades of red hidden between California s monstrous conifers that s when you re somewhere wild Out there you re at adventure s doorstep or so they say You re approaching grandeur You re this close to more likes on Instagram For years I was proud to spend time in these lands deemed worthy of protection attempting to kill off my roots in lands that aren t Roughly a million people enjoy the Ice Age Trail each year though its sprawling length promises a good chance at solitude Photograph by Jacqueline Kehoe And then we entered a global pandemic I was relegated to my own backyard stuck somewhere I barely knew Wisconsin Life seemed sure to be smaller and stagnant like a yearlong winter without the snow or ice I imagined myself perpetually indoors sipping tea and lighting fires despite the degree heat That of course didn t happen I scoured the list of local green spaces dead set on finding a life raft Even something not quite wild would be fine so long as it was quiet Related Learn how Dayton Ohio became a destination for urban parks I settled on Indian Lake County Park just northwest of Madison Among its surprisingly sweeping views my life got disrupted yet again I discovered that the park s wide open trails were actually part of a mile network called the Ice Age Trail It was on the IAT that I d start walking and walking and walking and finally see The glacier s ancient path One of National Scenic Trails in the United States the Ice Age Trail winds through Wisconsin along the edges of the most recent glaciation which ended some years ago Zoom in to explore the Ice Age Trail in detail SOURCE ICE AGE TRAIL ALLIANCE The trail is particularly wild up north in the bear country of Chequamegon Nicolet National Forest It dives south toward Madison where glacial meltwater met resistant quartzite and sandstone and created spectacular formations around Devils Lake Parfrey s Glen and Gibraltar Rock As it edges toward Milwaukee the trail s oldest sections trace Kettle Moraine State Forest s roller coaster hills finally reaching its eastern terminus in Door County on the shores of Sturgeon Bay Although you can see the glacier s signature all across the country New York State s Finger Lakes Washington State s coulees nowhere are traces of this polar rage clearer than right here Related Learn how a high school teacher helped discover the origins of this mysterious landscape The IAT marks an ancient icy battleground studded in every direction with formations like moraines eskers kames and drumlins All along the trail you can track the carnage and chart the glacier s movements You can dunk your hand in kettle lakes the watery orphans of a two mile thick ice sheet that scraped and scoured every inch of this area You can nearly step into this volatile past I walk through aspen and maple groves remnants of oak savannah along marshes prairie and drumlin fields up flat top buttes and terminal moraines Seen on their own the vistas are gentle and serene but together they tell a story of destruction and transformation Tune yourself into this way of thinking and even the quietest sounds or changes in vegetation carry heft The marks of ancient glacial activity remain on the landscape across northern North America but nowhere are they more apparent than along the Ice Age Trail Photograph by Jacqueline Kehoe A section near Cross Plains reminds me of the Rockies High on a narrow ridge the pines are thick The trail winds downward enters town and then heads east on a county road at least for now Like all our public lands the IAT is a work in progress Trailblazing The staff and volunteers of the Ice Age Trail Alliance IATA are still carving out the trail Though it s technically miles long and has been a national scenic trail since it doesn t entirely or easily connect yet A core of or of us show up to most trail building events explains Bob Kaspar volunteer coordinator of Dane County and a volunteer himself We work hard but there s an immense amount of satisfaction there You get a first timer maybe it s only feet they re working on but for the rest of their life they re going to say Hey I built this They ve got a ways to go So far volunteers have cut out and marked some plus miles connector segments will crisscross suburbs or wind down empty county roads until more suitable land is bought acquired or donated Their painted yellow blazes always seem to far outnumber the hikers and thru hikers aka thousand milers are a fairly recent phenomenon Those of us who have hiked the trail are our own breed Tess Mulrooney tells me She became a thousand miler in I don t usually go for glamor but I wanted to be one of the first Getting to that number was really something In just five years it s doubled to she says Designated parking lots service nearly every segment of the trail providing hundreds of options for day hikes Maps and guidebooks are available through the Ice Age Trail Alliance Photograph by Jacqueline Kehoe I keep walking At times I m inches from cornstalks others I m navigating slippery boulders and mini canyons others still I m walking over fresh laid boardwalks to the tune of tireless wood frogs Most often I do so alone Though it s estimated that roughly a million people gather on the trail each year to hike snowshoe or simply disconnect you d never know it Though the pandemic may be changing that Traffic on the trail has definitely increased with the pandemic says Gail Piotrowski Central Moraines Chapter Co Coordinator We expect there to be a lot of maintenance in the coming years but the organization is incredibly well led at the Alliance level We get out there as family Related As trails reopen is it safe or ethical to go hiking this summer I tell Gail that I want to work on the trail with my hands too giving back part of what s been given to me I tell her that I don t own a good shovel and that I barely know how to work a screwdriver She laughs and tells me I can be taught One of the oft repeated phrases is trail building is people building That s it for us But for now I simply walk following a trail that winds for miles just minutes from my door and marks a path of both destruction and creation a trail built by people who love this land and deem it worthy of protection Take a hike alone Bob told me Take a look at what we ve done some of it s a work of art And it is Because it s only now in all this disruption that I ve found the wild Jacqueline Kehoe is a freelance writer and photographer from the Midwest Find her on Instagram Related Topics HIKING TRAILS VOLUNTEERING GLACIERS You May Also
