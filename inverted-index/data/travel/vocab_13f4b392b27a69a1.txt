Richard Jacyno iStock Getty Images Towering snow capped mountains evergreen forests filled with wildlife deep blue waters and coastlines dotted with little towns this isnâ t the setting of a fantasy novel this is Canada home to some of the worldâ s most thrilling landscapes Crossing Canadaâ s six time zones provinces and three territories might seem like a daunting challenge â and it can be Yet with new budget airlines a national train service and loads of car rental options Canada makes itself truly accessible to ambitious travelers Due to its vast size and varied regions different parts of Canada rely on different modes of transportation Trains run in the more densely populated areas like the Toronto â MontrÃ al corridor while public ferries operate extensively in British Columbia QuÃ bec and the Maritime provinces If you want to cover large distances in a shorter period of time regional and national airlines connect the country Flying takes days off travel time and lets you reach northern settlements inaccessible by road Advertisement All of Canadaâ s major cities have public transportation â and are committed to continuously expanding their networks of subways streetcars buses and bike routes Smaller cities also share this commitment to public transport If you want to city hop across Canada flying and taking the train and perhaps occasionally ferrying from province to province to avoid renting a car is totally doable Here are the best ways to get around Canada by plane train car boat and your own two feet Soak up some of Canadaâ s best scenery on a road trip Â Ascent Xmedia Getty Images Driving is one of the best ways to see the country Canada brims with amazing road trip opportunities and its vastness and spectacular natural scenery make driving one of the best ways to get around the country Whatâ s more train and plane tickets can quickly add up and wonâ t get you to the most remote spots Exempting the northern territories all of Canada is connected by the Trans Canada Highway Which you could easily drive from Vancouver British Columbia to St Johnâ s Newfoundland â in a mere hours without traffic of course Having a car makes it super easy to jump from town to town visit national parks and stop at interesting places which you just canâ t do on any other form of transport Even major cities like Toronto and MontrÃ al were built to navigate by car â although these days they have ample public transportation and horrible traffic Tip for traveling coast to coast If youâ re short on time a combination of car rentals and inter province flights will probably be your best option for traveling across Canada There are long stretches on the long drive that are just prairie land Though these landscapes are not without their interesting points a hour drive across such flatness might not be the best use of your limited time in the country How easy is it to rent a car in Canada In most provinces visitors can legally drive for up to three months with their home country driver s license In British Columbia that period is six months If youâ re spending considerable time in Canada think about getting an International Driving Permit IDP which is valid for one year Your home automobile association can issue one for a small fee Always carry your home license together with the IDP To rent a car in Canada you generally need to be at least years old some companies will rent to drivers between the ages of and for an additional charge hold a valid driver s license an international permit may be required if youâ re not from an English or French speaking country and have a major credit card Advertisement Major international car rental companies usually have branches at airports train stations and in city centers In Canada on the spot rentals

most gorgeous landscapes in the world through mountain valleys and alongside roaring rivers VIA Rail operates most of Canadaâ s intercity and transcontinental passenger trains its trains chugging over miles of track In some remote parts of the country such as Churchill Manitoba trains provide the only overland access Rail service is most efficient in the corridor between QuÃ bec City and Windsor Ontario â particularly between MontrÃ al and Toronto the regionâ s two major hubs The rail network does not extend to Newfoundland Prince Edward Island or the Northwest Territories Taking the train is more expensive than the bus and often comparable to the price of flying Still most people find it a fun comfortable way to travel June to mid October is peak season when prices are about higher Buying tickets in advance even just five days before can yield significant savings If you want to take a train ride that doubles as a sightseeing tour VIA Rail has several classic train services the Canadian Toronto to Vancouver Hudson Bay Winnipeg to the polar bear hangout of Churchill Ocean MontrÃ al to Halifax and Jasper to Prince Rupert across the Canadian Rockies Privately run regional train companies offer additional rail touring opportunities such as the famed Rocky Mountaineer Intercity bus services in Canada are slow but extremely cost effective Â AscentXmedia Getty Images Save some money by riding the bus You can travel between most major cities by coach Although Greyhound Canada has cut service dramatically the only routes in Canada are now to the USA Megabus still offers many

conditioning bring a sweater reclining seats free wi fi and onboard movies On long journeys buses make meal stops every few hours usually at highway service stations Bus travel is takes longer than other means of transport â but itâ ll cost you much less The earlier you buy a ticket online the cheaper your fare yet if you wait too long a ticket can be as high as â at which point you may as well just fly If youâ re short on time take a plane There are options for carriers to fly you between Canadian cities including Flair WestJet and Air Canada With many low cost fares youâ ll have to pay extra â and these surcharges can add up fast So do all the calculations before you determine which airline you will fly A seemingly inexpensive flight can end up costing you a lot more than a more expensive one with fewer surcharges And like most fares if you book far enough in advance you will likely get the best deal With some planning you can cross the entirety of Canada via back roads Â PamelaJoeMcFarlane Getty Images Enjoy Canadaâ s back roads on a bike Much of Canada is great for bicyclists With some planning you can set off on long distance trips entirely on quiet back roads while many cities including Edmonton MontrÃ al Ottawa Toronto Vancouver and Victoria have designated bike routes Traveling all the way across Canada on a bike is a three month marathon Thereâ s a big community of support at Biking Across Canada if you want to team up with a group or get some tips for this herculean task Buying a bike in Canada is easy as is reselling it before you leave Specialist bike shops have the best selection and advice general sporting goods stores may have lower prices Some bicycle stores and rental outfitters also sell used bicycles To sniff out the best bargains scour flea markets garage sales thrift shops Facebook Marketplace and Kijiji or check the noticeboards in hostels and universities These are also the best places to sell your bike Ferries offer essential
