holiday in Voyage Sorgun The resort is beautifully situated in the middle of nature with pine trees all around and stunning sea views The rooms are modern clean and comfortable cleaned every day with attention to detail The staff is very friendly and helpful You really feel welcome from the moment you arrive What was particularly striking was the quality of the food varied fresh and always delicious Whether you dine at the buffet restaurant or choose one of the à la carte restaurants it s culinary delight The facilities are top notch multiple swimming pools an aquatic park for the children a fine spa and plenty of entertainment for young and old Especially the shows in the evening were professional and very entertaining A big plus is the all inclusive formula which really covers everything even premium drinks Voyage Sorgun is an absolute must for those looking for luxury comfort and relaxation in a beautiful setting Thanks to Jiska and our personal assistant this holiday became unforgettable for us Voyage Sorgun is highly recommended anyway but with such a personal assistant it really becomes a star experience The resort itself has been groomed to perfection The rooms are cleaned daily with towel change and in the evening your bed is made which makes for a truly luxurious feeling Everything exudes calm and quality Don t hesitate Read more Automatically

sufficient although there are rocks in the sea you can enter from the pier The sea was very beautiful in September We have a child we stayed in a bungalow and they arranged a room place it was like home it was very spacious you wake up with the birds chirping among the trees Cleaning was good it was time to get towels and there was service The food is already very good so I look for ulterior motives in those who don t like it We had come a car before and it was free of charge but this year we did not choose it because it was paid We had most of our lunches at Cuseine it was very successful Alcohol is very good beer is served in bottles coke redbull etc in the same way Also the QR code application is very good you do not have to look at the employees to ask for something you order immediately The employees are very nice everyone is helpful and friendly The evening after show entertainment was good the lobby bar was calm and good The patisserie is very good there is a separate section for the chocolate you want The fruit section by the pool was nice This was our Voyage holiday its quality is indisputable As for the things that can be improved we didn t have children when we came before so I didn t pay much attention to them but the kids club area is small there are no shows or anything for children to have fun they do more school like activities There were also events for children in Belek before the evening show but not here Aquapark is inadequate They built an amusement park it was nice Evening shows remained weak Apart from that you are asked if you have any requests for anything from the really wonderful cleaning ladies to the kitchen staff There are already two assistant employees you can always reach them you convey all your requests to them and they find solutions First of all we would like to thank Ms Yasar and Oyku and all other Voyage employees we had a very nice holiday and we will choose it again Read more Date of stay

for the time We had a wonderful holiday as always In a new feature the room includes a toothbrush with a cap and a small tube of toothpaste A mosquito net was added to the balcony door Towels are changed twice a day when cleaning in the morning and in the evening if desired In the main restaurant there are more dishes with shrimp and mussels On this occasion we actively benefited from the assistance of our assistants Alexander Zhanara and Cinar Thank them very much for their promptness positivity and active desire to improve the quality of our holiday I also want to thank the reception manager Alina Her professional assistance in the matter of occupancy and extension of the room was very important and invaluable to us I m hoping for an equally wonderful holiday next year I wish the

cleaners do everything quickly and neatly the cleaning of the rooms is excellent turndown service is convenient the food varied and tasty even our picky children ate with pleasure we were also pleasantly surprised by the Easter surprise from hotel for Orthodox Easter a pastry shop everything is fresh and very tasty the cheesecake is on fire bars the cocktails are delicious and intoxicating the beach small but clean and well groomed aquashoes are not required but will not be superfluous swimming pools a lot clean for different tastes noisy children s relaxation The area is clean well groomed very green we checked in at am and the first thing that struck me was the incredible smell of plants and pine trees And of course this is the highlight of the hotel personal assistants thank you very much for your help Aidai Apar and Mahabat Aidai was always in touch helped with the nuances of the room gave a tour of the hotel helped with a mini excursion in Side thank you very much to

arrive in the morning The room is usually only available from noon but you can store your suitcases and lock your hand luggage in the spa There are also changing rooms and showers Thus the holiday can start directly and you are already allowed to use everything in full The food is a dream at any time of the day Breakfast lunch and dinner are all offered as a giant buffet and in addition there are of course various snack stations and a la carte restaurants And there s really something for everyone Simply a rich offer of food and drinks in very good quality around the clock The hotel itself is very clean and you just don t lack anything The staff is always eager to meet every wish I couldn t find a better service like Voyage on other trips The partial separation into different reclining areas for families and adults only also makes the concept interesting for everyone There is a rich sports and entertainment program to choose from However if you just want to lie lazily in the sun you will not be bothered or harassed For me just really the best hotel there is We will certainly come back quite often See you soon my friends Read more Automatically translated Date of stay September

learned that it ll also serve during this winter season We were there on the last week of November with a group of friends First thank you very much to your friends at the front desk who upgraded our room in the reservation and led us to the family room We already knew we t be disappointed choosing this place for years but we were also pleased with the satisfaction of our fellow friends that we convinced to take our vacation here I can confidently say that the indoor pool temperature is sufficient and we have no trouble with hygiene as we spent most of our time at the spa Not all à la carte served because it was winter season but everything at the open Carino Steak was flawless as usual from flavor to presentation At the hour Cuisine restaurant certain items were removed from the menu until the summer season but the rest were good enough and still very tasty as usual It s obvious that we haven t had a lot of trouble since we stayed for the price of the summer season Drinks are served in closed boxes beers are bottled and the drink selection is wide The food variety at the main restaurant is sufficient and delicious And the dessert and artisanal chocolates in the bakery section are a must try The chef and his team sign for incredible flavors Voyage Sorgun s highlight is the staff that provides these services and has made us choose this place for years When we go I can t describe how beautiful the gesture is when our beloved Mehmet Eroğlu comes to see us who we have known for years and are upset to know if we can see If we had the news and hadn t had a shortage of time we would have arrived right there We ve booked the next year so when we arrive in October we re eager to get a taste of that wonderful mixture from Mehmet We know from previous years and this year also assisted us Mrs Story and Cuisine Careful of Carino Steak and Cuisine restaurant Halilcan careful of us at the main restaurant as soon as you see us at our usual place preparing our person service before we sit in our place Ahmet Polat the beloved Nuray who did not even give us the opportunity to ask for everything that is missing in our room for days the beloved Emine the beloved Fatma Bacak and Umut who are always with us at the speed of light in the lobby bar in the evenings the beloved Ebelboy belren who is not to be tortured for us to see in the winter season the beloved Zele and our hotel entrance and exits in the lobby bar Mr Ahmet was a memorable holiday in this year We ve already been able to give up on Voyage Sorgun for years with the comfort of seeing familiar faces but I d love to share with you that this year s visiting friends will not be their first but last vacation here Thanks again and again Voyage Sorgun and the impeccable team at Voyage Sorgun To meet

daughter between August It was a holiday where we felt the importance given to service quality and customer satisfaction in every field Even though I chose a bungalow during the reservation it was a nice gesture that they upgraded us to the main building due to my mother s age It is very nice to have assistants assigned to support you in every need you need they even sent mosquito repellent to the beach thank you The hotel is built on a large area but I can say that it is more compact and generally flat compared to similar hotels It s easy to get down to the beach from the main building Since August is a period when both the sea and the air are very hot we preferred to spend time in our room or in the cool lobby of the hotel during the day and in the pool after The rooms are of ideal size We used the sofa as a bed instead of an extra bed for the third person Even though the bed wasn t as soft I felt very comfortable There is a Nespresso machine and capsules for coffee lovers in the rooms L occitane products are used in the bathroom down to the loofah They ll probably provide it if you want but you don t need anything other than a toothbrush and toothpaste Towels and sheets are clean Room cleaning is done as often as you want Multiple pools available We preferred the version as it was quieter and under the trees It s not big you can t swim for long the depth is cm it s just cooling for the season We never went down to breakfast except the last day but both the breakfast and the food are very rich There is food that appeals to every diet and palate We did not feel the need to go to a la card restaurants The food is delicious and the desserts too Especially taste the sauteed shrimp and baklava Overall it was a holiday experience that we were very pleased with We would like to thank especially our assistants Gökçe and Yaşar Hanım all the friendly staff and the hotel management who have adopted the understanding of service and quality Read more Date of stay

VOYAGE I had the opportunity to stay in this beautiful hotel between October It is an excellent hotel that is worth the money From the first check in to the last check out day they were very attentive and attentive the employees were extremely friendly all the staff were helpful They try to help as much as possible Mr Fatih at the reception helped me with the room as much as he could I thank him very much for this There is a private assistant application in the hotel I would like to thank Öykü Hanım and Yaşar Hanım for everything every problem They were helpful just write WhatsApp and they will come to you and solve your problem Once again thank you very much to both ladies food and beverage quality Food variety and taste were very good the bars on the beach and the food in the lobby are all very good and high quality Room cleaning is very good room cleaning is done every day and towels are changed twice in the afternoon The mini bar is renewed every day there is a coffee machine hot water heater and safe in the room free of charge Even though it is the middle of October the weather is very nice and the sea is warm There are fragments and fragments of rocks in the sea Since I entered the sea from the pier I was blown away The staff working at the pier always provide service and meet our requests They ask me if I am available The occupancy rate at the hotel was around and the next day I checked out the occupancy rate was The majority of Russian tourists are approximately Russian German Turkish and the rates from other countries when I stayed at the hotel are locals and foreigners everyone is equal I can even say that Turks are given a little more attention There are no wristbands no towel limit beach towels and all employees Thank you very much see you next year

hotel is very luxurious you have a personal assistant during the stay that you sit with in a group app and who arranges everything for you from a buggy to medicine to transport to the reception etc free swimming diapers by the pool swimming towels to be released and exchanged times a day fresh towels in the room night light is turned on in the room in the evening curtains closed in the evening minibar stocked every day and belongs to all inclusive children s buffet in the buffet restaurant Hipp baby food all day to grab animation team and kids club really so extensive and good in the bedroom all kinds of shampoos soap even shaving cream and razor toothbrushes good hair dryer The hour restaurant is also very good The staff is very helpful and friendly throughout It is nice to use Google Translate if you do not speak Turkish many staff only speak Turkish Our son has various food allergies the tickets at the buffet could be filled in a little more accurately When I asked for help with this it was taken very seriously We were a bit disappointed that we suddenly had to pay for a number of a la carte restaurants this was not the case the previous times Incidentally the food

hotel is a fairy tale big green area lots of coniferous trees very well planned The beach is not very big but it bathes a large green lawn with sunbeds walking on this grass is one pleasure a special advantage for families with babies The only thing I would like to add is an area with more sun protection some big tent The pools are clean never had any health problems It s a handy children s pool but I d like some of it to be under the awning too It s very convenient that you don t need to receive and hand in towels on cards you don t need to go with them and make sure that someone doesn t pick up The animation is good not very obtrusive but a lot of things everyone can find something for themselves Food beyond praise tasty everything fresh control every day And what s just great especially for families with children is you can take food from the restaurant to the room And the most important thing is this amazing pastry shop crazy delicious cakes and chocolates We re
