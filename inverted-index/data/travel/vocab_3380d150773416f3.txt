To Eat Eat Need To Know Know The Fodor s Five The five things you need to know before traveling to Kyoto Respectfully get to know Kyoto s geisha culture Kyoto s Gion and Pontocho have been known as the geisha districts since the century Visit these neighborhoods to get immersed in geisha culture you might even spot some of these ladies strolling past in kimonos and pale makeup However please be respectful by not approaching or photographing geisha without permission and note that all photography is banned on Hanamikoji Street You can also visit Gion Corner to see geisha perform music and elegant dances or dress up like one at a makeover portrait studio Kyoto s subway system can be inconvenient so plan on walking or taking the bus Compared to Tokyo the subway system in Kyoto is limited and many popular attractions are not accessible by train The best way to reach popular areas is usually by bus Check Google Maps for routes and timetables and keep in mind that public transportation shuts down between approximately midnight and dawn You can also allow time for long scenic walks between each destination just be sure to wear good walking shoes and sun protection Taxis are another option but be aware that fares can be high Stay in an affordable machiya or traditional townhouse Hotels in Kyoto can be pricey and book up fast especially during high season spring is a popular time to visit For a more unique and cultural experience consider booking a machiya or traditional wooden townhouse Many machiya are available on Airbnb and other booking sites and are a great deal when shared between multiple people traveling together You ll get to stay in a house that has old school tatami mats and sliding doors yet with renovated modern amenities Bring cash and your passport to shop for artisan goods Kyoto is a wonderful shopping destination for those that love artisanal handmade products and foods Look for yatsuhashi baked rice flour sweets in beautiful packaging ceremonial matcha from Uji and shrine souvenirs made from natural materials such as pentagram ema or wooden plaques from Seimei Shrine Have lots of yen in your wallet as Japan remains largely cash based and shops often don t take credit cards Some boutiques give tax free discounts to tourists if you show your passport and spend over yen US Plan ahead to avoid swarms of tourists Kyoto s most popular attractions can get overrun with visitors especially on weekends and holidays To avoid the crush plan to visit the famous temples as early or late in the day as possible and book advance tickets if you can If you re keen to see the red torii of Fushimi Inari consider going in the evening and heading to the distant gates that have less foot traffic You can also consult the Kyoto Travel Congestion
