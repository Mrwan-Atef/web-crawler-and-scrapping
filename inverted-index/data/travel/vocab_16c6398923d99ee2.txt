Everything you need to know about moussaka the classic Greek dish The dish we now recognise as moussaka seems to have been refined in Nicholas Tselementes s seminal Greek cookery book Odigos Mageirikis but there are countless variations across the country and beyond Photograph by Ant Duncan TRAVEL Everything you need to know about moussaka the classic Greek dish It may be an icon of Greek cuisine but this hearty layered dish hails from beyond the country s borders and its present form is a relatively recent innovation By Felicity Cloake Photographs by Ant Duncan August min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK You ll find moussaka with its chunky layers of deeply savoury sweetly spiced meat silky aubergines and creamy bechamel sauce on the menu at every whitewashed tourist taverna No surprise then that it s perceived by many visitors as Greece s national dish Some in the Greek diaspora however seem less convinced with chef Peter Conistis telling listeners to the Ouzo Talk podcast that You might hate me but it started as a Turkish dish In reality moussaka s true origins may lie even further afield In Kitab al Tabikh a century manuscript referred to in English as A Baghdad Cookery Book there s a recipe for maghmuma or muqatta a consisting of alternating strata of aubergine and onions spiced meat and fat soaked in a vinegar spiked gravy And according to Charles Perry an expert on medieval Arabic cuisine the word moussaka comes from the Arabic musaqqâ moistened It s an etymology that aptly sums up the attraction of a dish sauced with olive oil tomatoes and meat juices all topped with a generous slick of bechamel and that s just the modern Greek iteration In fact versions of moussaka can be found throughout the Middle Eastern North African and Balkan worlds under an array of different names Food and travel writer Ghillie Başan writes that the word musakka in Turkish simply denotes a dish of fried vegetables with minced meat which is what it s generally agreed would have passed for moussaka in Greece too until Nicholas Tselementes arrived on the scene Born on the island of Sifnos in Tselementes grew up in Athens and seems to have trained in classical French techniques in Vienna at the turn of the century before returning to Greece where he began publishing a cookery magazine in A book of recipes and household advice followed and proved such a success that his name quickly became synonymous with Greek cuisine even today almost a century after Odigos Mageirikis Cookery Guide first appeared on the market tselemente remains a generic Greek term for a cookbook The Greek food writer and journalist Aglaia Kremezi who s written extensively on Tselementes notes that despite taking the credit for publishing the first comprehensive Greek recipe book the chef doesn t appear to have been particularly keen on traditional cooking describing it as greasy over spiced and unappealing deficiencies he blamed on the influence and contamination of the Ottoman occupation which lasted from the mid century until Olive oil garlic herbs and lemon were anathema to his taste buds according to Kremezi who concludes that Tselementes favoured sweet and very mild foods and this partly explains his adoration for bechamel sauce which is made of course with butter and milk rather than oil An early version of moussaka is mentioned in a century manuscript but bechamel sauce is a more modern addition Photograph by Ant Duncan Extra vegetables such as courgette can be added to the dish Photograph by Ant Duncan Prior to the publication of Odigos Mageirikis Kremezi claims there was no moussaka as we know it today Just layers of fried aubergine topped with meat and tomato sauce with maybe some cheese at the top This was the version her own grandmother used to cook The dish we now recognise as moussaka seems to have come into being in the pages of Tselementes s book He devoted an entire chapter to the subject providing six different recipes mostly involving swapping the aubergines for other vegetables and almost all involving his signature blanket of white sauce It s this topping that now sets a Greek moussaka apart from its many cousins around the region as Conistis concedes on Ouzo Talk In history it starts off as a Turkish dish but it s definitely Greek with a lot of thanks to the French for the bechamel In other words a dish that those of us outside the region think of as quintessentially Greek is historically speaking far more complex indeed the food writer Nikos Stavroulakis calls Tselementes s obsession with French ingredients and techniques the biggest tragedy in Greek cuisine Just as the vegan chickpea and aubergine stew that passes as a moussaka or maghmour in Lebanon is very different from Albanian musaka involving yoghurt topped pork and potato there s also huge variation between recipes and no single right way to make moussaka even within Greece The basics of the dish tend to stay the same layers of aubergine and minced meat are finished with a creamy topping The finer details however are fiercely contested Athens born Rena Salaman informs readers of her classic collection Greek Food that lamb is more authentic than beef while Greek celebrity chef Akis Petretzikis recommends the latter Food writer Georgina Hayden s Greek Cypriot family recipe uses a mixture of beef and pork and the late Evdokia Antginas a home cook and cookbook author from the Peloponnese favoured a mixture of veal pork and lamb The choice of vegetables used is equally up for debate Potatoes according to Salaman are an addition from the Greek region of Macedonia while Athens born and bred food writer Carolina Doriti includes them in the recipe in her recent book Salt of the Earth They create a more stable foundation and help the dish keep its shape better she writes adding they also add flavour and starchiness which is always comforting The courgettes meanwhile are her mum s addition but in the Cycladic islands she reports artichokes often feature instead The dish typically features layers of aubergine and minced meat finished with a creamy topping but the rest varies from cook to cook Photograph by Ant Duncan The Orthodox fasting calendar means meat free versions aren t uncommon either Tselementes had a vegan recipe using minced aubergines tomatoes and breadcrumbs Traditionally fried in copious amounts of olive oil the vegetable element these days is just as likely to be either baked or cooked on a griddle to make the dish lighter The bechamel sauce meanwhile might be replaced with yoghurt or whipped feta or enriched with egg yolks Chefs around the world have played with the form in numerous other ways too creating recipes for moussaka made with everything from lobster New York s Konstantinos Troumouhis to butter chicken Australian chef George Calombaris Koukoumavlos in Santorini reimagined the dish as a souffle Dubai s Eat Greek Kouzina chain served it in a burger The Zillers in Athens added it as a pizza topping and London s Kalimera once deconstructed it entirely The fact that none of these variants are still on offer at the establishments concerned might suggest that actually some things are better left alone although for the adventurous a scallop and taramasalata moussaka remains on the menu at Sydney s Alpha Both Salaman and Doriti decry what the latter describes as the heavy oily versions of moussaka found in more tourist orientated restaurants in Greece Doriti writes that she hardly ever orders it when eating out saying Like many other Greeks I know moussaka is a dish I mostly enjoy cooking and eating at home Moreover making it for oneself gives the cook licence to tweak it to their own tastes whether that means leaving out the meat or adding copious amounts of olive oil and garlic in defiance of Tselementes s fussy palate Red wine can give a moussaka s meat sauce more depth Photograph by Ant Duncan The type of protein used is a matter of debate with some favouring lamb and others arguing for beef pork veal or various combinations of meats Photograph by Ant Duncan However you like your moussaka though Greek cookery teacher Elisavet Sotiriadou advises exercising patience once it s cooked explaining the dish needs time to set to allow the flavours to bloom She recalls being at restaurants in Greece where chefs have refused to serve the moussaka as it needed time to rest True as this may be resisting the temptation to dive straight in might prove a challenge Carolina Doriti s moussaka Greek moussaka is always layered and baked in the oven A base of sliced potatoes helps keep the shape better and works as a great flavour combination too To make the dish lighter you can roast the vegetables instead of frying them as described here I use an oval shaped dish approximately x x Serves Takes mins Ingredients For the meat sauce tbsp olive oil minced beef ideally chuck and blade shoulder large onion chopped garlic cloves chopped bay leaves cinnamon stick dry red wine tomatoes peeled and pureed in a blender or canned chopped tomatoes with the juices tsp tomato puree tsp dried oregano tbsp chopped parsley pinch of sugar optional For the vegetables medium aubergines cut lengthways into slices light olive oil for frying potatoes peeled and cut lengthways into slices large courgettes cut lengthways into slices For the bechamel litres whole milk butter plain flour pinch of freshly grated nutmeg kefalotyri or pecorino cheese grated A base of sliced potatoes gives Carolina Doriti s moussaka structure Photograph by Ant Duncan Method To make the meat sauce heat the olive oil in a large wide frying pan Brown the minced beef breaking it up as you stir for mins Add the onion garlic bay leaves and cinnamon stick and season with salt and pepper Stir for a couple of minutes until it looks mostly dry then pour in the wine and stir again Add the tomatoes and tomato puree and turn the heat down to low if it doesn t look juicy enough add a bit of water to the mixture Let the sauce gently simmer stirring occasionally until most of the liquid is absorbed for mins Meanwhile soak the aubergine slices in a bowl of lukewarm salted water for mins then pat them dry and set aside Add the oregano and parsley to the meat sauce Adjust the seasoning and add the sugar to taste if desired then give it another stir Remove the cinnamon stick and bay leaves and discard Take the frying pan off the heat and set aside Set another large frying pan over a medium high heat Pour in enough of the light olive oil to cover the base then pan fry all the vegetables in batches turning them until softened and golden on both sides they don t need to be completely cooked as they ll cook further in the oven Place on a tray lined with kitchen paper and season both sides with salt and pepper Heat the milk for the bechamel in a saucepan Place another large saucepan over a medium heat and gently melt the butter Add the flour to the butter and mix constantly with a whisk to form a pale roux Gradually add the warm milk whisking constantly until you ve used all the milk and the sauce thickens you want it to be medium thick not too runny and definitely not too stiff Stir in the nutmeg and remove from the heat Season with salt and pepper to taste Spoon tbsp of the bechamel sauce into the meat sauce and mix Mix tbsp of the grated cheese into the rest of the bechamel Heat oven to fan gas Arrange the potato slices in a large deep baking dish Layer the courgettes on top and sprinkle with tbsp of the grated cheese Pour over the meat sauce and spread out using the back of a spoon Layer the aubergines on top pour over some of the bechamel and sprinkle with a little more of the grated cheese Pour over the remaining bechamel and spread it out evenly Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake on a low shelf in the oven for mins or until golden on top Remove from the oven and leave to cool and settle for at least mins before serving Taken from Salt of the Earth by Carolina Doriti Quadrille Food stylist Amy Stephenson Prop stylist Vivi Garcia Published in Issue autumn
