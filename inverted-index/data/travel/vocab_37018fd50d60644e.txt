Berlin Germany Europe Top choice in Friedrichshain Login Save The East Side Gallery is the embodiment of Berlin s grit and guts It s a symbol of hope creativity and resilience for Berliners but also the rest of the world In the Berlin Wall a grey and grisly divider of humanity was finally torn down after years Today its longest surviving stretch forms the world s largest permanent open air art gallery known as the East Side Gallery The nearly mile long km section of wall located along the Spree River and Mühlenstrasse showcases more than murals Dozens of international artists have translated the Cold War era s global euphoria and optimism into a mix of political statements psychedelic induced musings and manifold artistic visions These days graffiti tagging forms a good part of the artwork though it s strictly frowned upon as great measures have been taken to preserve and even reproduce some of the Gallery s most iconic paintings like Dmitri Vrubel s so called Fraternal Kiss and Thierry Noir s cartoon faces Nowadays you ll often see the East Side Gallery covered in groups of shutterbugs the city estimates over three million visitors come here annually as well as ample unsightly fences warding off vandalism On its backside carousers drink beer and play techno from boomboxes along the banks of the Spree while on the other side of the wall Mühlenstrasse has turned into the kind of dry characterless commercial development that makes the locals moan But despite such a touristy backdrop just ask your average Berliner there will always be a kind of magic about the East Side Gallery Driving past after a serious night of clubbing or a biking adventure through the city will provide a little burst of pride and excitement like watching a film strip of history unfold After all this relic is proof of just how far Berlin has come People walk past the My God Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love artwork on the East Side Gallery in Berlin LordRunar Getty Images The history of the East Side Gallery During the Cold War the part of the wall where the East Side Gallery is now situated was a border crossing to East Germany accessible to West Germans only Essentially it was an interior wall acting as an extra barrier to stop fleeing East Germans before reaching the infamous death strip a no man s land between the East and West sides where guards shot on sight Following the Peaceful Revolution in most of the Berlin Wall was soon dismantled this is the longest remaining stretch One year later over artists from countries staged a now legendary painting session here on the eastern side of the Wall The East Side Gallery was eventually declared a monument by local authorities Some of the most famous murals have forever found their places on the pages of history and pop culture For example Birgit Kinder s Test the Rest showing a Trabi bursting through the Berlin Wall Dmitri Vrubel s My God Help Me To Survive This Deadly Love also known as Fraternal Kiss depicting East German leader Erich Honecker and high ranking Soviet politician Leonid Brezhnev locking lips and East German artist Thomas Klingenstein s Detour to the Japanese Sector a vivid depiction of the Japanese landscape Japan was one of the countries East German citizens were prohibited from traveling to In the gallery underwent a controversial restoration due to the wall s decay from atmospheric conditions and tourist graffiti Several murals were erased and in many cases artists were asked to take part in repainting Birgit Kinder s Test the Rest showing a car bursting through the wall Tupungato Shutterstock Some refused and even took legal action saying that they had not received adequate revenue from the monument and arguing that the restoration had destroyed the authenticity of the works Others including Vrubel who recreated Fraternal Kiss obliged albeit with a heavy heart Today the East Side Gallery is a symbol of an older period of Berlin the Cold War but also the early years of German reunification when the city was as gritty and hard boiled as ever Opposite the wall on the other side of Mühlenstrasse lies a newer Berlin high rise condo buildings a concert arena and further beyond a new shopping mall that s often been described as an eyesore The East Side Gallery too remains an area of interest to investors In part of the monument was scheduled to be destroyed to build deluxe apartments Protests from Berliners and even an appearance from David Hasselhoff himself eventually led to the murals being moved across the street and preserved Plan your visit The East Side Gallery is located on Mühlenstrasse a main thoroughfare straddling the Kreuzberg former West Mitte and Friedrichshain former East neighborhoods It runs parallel to the Spree
