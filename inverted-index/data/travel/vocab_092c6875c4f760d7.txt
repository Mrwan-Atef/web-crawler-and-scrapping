center For many a major trip goal is a dip at Insta famous Cala Porto beach for others itâ s a reservation at Grotta Palazzese a fine dining restaurant whose spectacular setting in a cave right above the sea commands a major premium Consider visiting the town either side of July and August to avoid the heftiest crowds and make time for its excellent Museo Pino Pascali an abattoirâ turnedâ contemporary art gallery dedicated to the great Puglian artist Pino Pascali Local tip Try the townâ s caffÃ speciale coffee spiked with sugar cream lemon zest and amaretto Itâ s said that the drink was invented at local institution Mario Campanella Il Super Mago del Gelo The mosaic floor of Otrantoâ s cathedral is a medieval marvel Davide Zanin Photography Shutterstock Otranto Best for history More than locals were slaughtered when the Ottomans invaded Otranto in Today their skulls make for an unconventional welcome committee at the cityâ s Romanesque cathedral Yet what makes this hulking landmark unmissable is the action packed mosaic floor â one of the largest and most intriguing ever executed in medieval Europe Since Otranto lies a mere miles from the Balkan coast itâ s not surprising that its history is riddled with occupations and liberations Sleuth around its compact old quarter to peel the past off in layers Greek Roman Turkish and Napoleonic In summer peel down to your swimsuit for Otrantoâ s beaches are among the most inviting of Puglia beaches The orecchiette making ladies of Arco Basso are the stars of Bari Vecchia Ivo Antonie de Rooij Shutterstock The orecchiette making ladies of Arco Basso are the stars of Bari Vecchia ollirg Shutterstock Bari Best for street food and street made food Advertisement Forget the North Pole â youâ ll find the real St Nick in Bari The cityâ s gigantic Basilica di San Nicola shelters the relics of this early Christian bishop whose fondness for secret gift giving inspired the white bearded icon we all know and love In Bari Vecchia the lovable labyrinthine old town you can visit the remarkable century Norman cathedral and the excellent archaeological museum Yet the undisputed stars of this quarter are the legendary pasta making ladies of Arco Basso Early each morning they set up their spianatoie wooden boards along the narrow backstreets then get to work kneading rolling and expertly shaping Pugliaâ s signature orecchiette In addition to ear shaped pasta the city also whets the appetite with Italian cuisine like focaccia barese Bari style focaccia sgagliozze polenta fritters and panzerotti deep fried calzone â fortifying street snacks on any Bari bar crawl After visiting the areaâ s charming towns connect to nature in the Parco Nazionale del Gargano JurateBuiviene Shutterstock Promontorio del Gargano Best for town nature balance A chocolate box of photogenic paesi towns and arresting natural beauty the Gargano Promontory is an all in one treat in Pugliaâ s northeast Clifftop Vieste and Peschici make ideal bases their narrow streets scattered with fluttering laundry color popping geraniums and seafood trattorie In the warmer months boat tours sail from their harbors to Garganoâ s dazzling sea caves coves and stacks Both towns are also summer gateways to the nearby Tremiti Islands where fragrant hikes clear waters and a medieval abbey add up to an evocative offshore escape Behind Vieste and Peschici twisting backroads and hiking trails crisscross the rugged mountainous expanse of the Parco Nazionale del Gargano home to ancient woodlands and brooding mountain villages The prettiest of the lot is Monte Santâ Angelo where according to the faithful the Archangel Michael made several apparitions in the fifth century Youâ ll find unusually shaped trulli houses all over Alberobello Martin Jung Getty Images Valle dâ Itria Best for one of a kind dwellings Should Snow White and her seven besties ever move to Italy World Heritageâ listed Alberobello is where youâ d find them The most visited town of the bucolic vine laced Valle d Itria itâ s known and beloved for its peculiar trulli limestone abodes crowned with conical roofs â a fabulously surreal sight clustered together like giant beehives in a fantastical fairy tale You can wine dine and shop in many of them as well as learn about their past at Trullo Sovrano a â livingâ museum that gives visitors at taste of trullo life in the century While several of Alberobelloâ s trulli offer accommodation consider exploring the town as a day trip and basing yourself instead in one of the valleyâ s lesser known jewel box towns Among them is chic whitewashed Ostuni rustic Cisternino and baroque Martina Franca Foodies know the last for its capocollo a delicately sweet cured meat regarded as the king of Pugliaâ s salami Planning tip From mid July to early August Martina Franca hosts the Festa della Valle dâ Itria a renowned music festival focused on opera GrecÃ a Salentina Best for Hellenic connections From Campania to Sicily ancient Hellenic ruins attest to a time when much of southern Italy was part of Magna Graecia Less known is the mark left by the Byzantine era Greeks This influence within the cultural heritage of Puglia is still palpable in the GrecÃ a Salentina Greek Salentine an area comprising low rise towns Calimera Carpignano Salentino Castrignano deâ Greci Corigliano d Otranto Cutrofiano Martano Martignano Melpignano Sogliano Cavour Soleto Sternatia and Zollino to the south of Lecce Here a few locals still speak Griko a variant of neo Greek and itâ s not unusual to see signs written in Greek characters If time is limited focus your attention on Corigliano dâ Otranto home to one of Pugliaâ s most impressive castles Melpignano and Martano The last two towns feature on the coveted Borghi Autentici dâ Italia Authentic Hamlets of Italy list Planning tip Several of Martanoâ s beautiful private courtyards are open to the public during Cortili Aperti Open Courtyards In

beautiful descend en masse to soak in sun at Gallipoliâ s superlative beaches â as well as the townâ s chic vibe and hedonistic nightlife Not that itâ s all beach clubs and bronzed pinups Gallipoli harbors the Cattedrale di Santâ Agata a shining example of barocco leccese architecture and the extraordinary Frantoio Ipogeo a subterranean century olive press Itâ s also home to the mysterious Fontana Greca Greek Fountain an intricately carved monument whose exact origins are still up for debate Planning tip Consider visiting Gallipoli in June or September to enjoy the beaches clubs and warmth without the peak season masses Architecture buffs will want to drink in the baroque monuments of Lecce marcobrivio gallery Shutterstock Lecce Best for baroque splendor If you like baroque architecture Lecce will dazzle you For the and century architects who developed the signature barocco leccesse more really was more â a philosophy made thrillingly evident in hyper theatrical buildings like the Duomo Palazzo Vescovile and Basilica di Santa Croce Santa Croceâ s intricately carved facade is one of Italyâ s architectural masterpieces Of course Lecceâ s backstory is much older than its year old showstoppers On Piazzetta Castromediano Sigismondo glass floor panels reveal a glimpse of a Renaissance oil store At nearby Museo Faggiano a mundane search for a sewage pipe led to the discovery of millennia old subterranean relics among them a pre Christian Messapian tomb and a Roman granary Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Italy
