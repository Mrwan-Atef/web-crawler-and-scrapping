score more went up like ecclesiastical billboards New ones were added in the mid century and one plus replacements for some lost to floods in the As most of the statues were carved from soft sandstone several weathered originals have been replaced with copies Some originals are housed in the Casements at Vyšehrad others are in the Lapidárium in Holešovice The most famous figure is the monument to
