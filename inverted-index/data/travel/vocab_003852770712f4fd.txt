Share The year in Ghana can be divided into wet and dry seasons Â and there are upsides and downsides to visiting in either Â Steven Harewood Shutterstock Being just a few degrees north of the equator Ghana has an average temperature that remains balmy all year Its mild tropical climate boasts two distinct seasons wet and dry Both of them offer their own perks and setbacks The wet season is an excellent time to visit the countryâ s north because the heat can be stifling the rest of the year but itâ s the dusty dry season that offers the regionâ s best wildlife viewing As a general rule Ghanaâ s mildest temperatures occur at higher elevations such as in the Ashanti Uplands with humidity clinging to the coastline in places like Accra and the Cape Coast The farther north you go the hotter and drier it gets Whenever you decide to visit Ghana youâ ll always find plenty of fantastic experiences including a calendar of colorful festivals thatâ s one of the country s distinct calling cards Season by season month by month here is our guide to the best times to visit Ghana Advertisement December to March is the best time for wildlife and festivals Ghanaâ s high season is also its dry season which runs from November to March With little to no rainfall itâ s fairly easy to travel across the country via Ghanaâ s network of well maintained roadways These months are an especially good time to visit the countryâ s south including the capital city of Accra In fact many Accra residents claim December is the best month to visit with the holidays in full swing and festivals such as Afrochella â a celebration of African music fashion art and culture â kicking up the celebratory feel One recurring event to keep an eye out for year round is the Ashanti Akwasidae festival held in Kumasi It takes place every sixth Sunday based on the Ashanti calendar and includes loads of drumming and dancing along with an impressive procession of the Ashanti king and his entourage Although the air can be quite dusty and dry in this season â the result of Saharan winds that blow across West Africa into the Gulf of Guinea â the rains are few humidity is lower meaning fewer mosquitos and the temperatures are cooler if only by a small but very noticeable degree Harmattan is the name for these cool dry winds which cause hazy skies not to mention dry skin eyes and throats Lather on some locally made shea butter to keep your skin moisturized and be aware that the overcast skies can make photography less than stellar The winds can also cause flight delays or cancellations because of poor visibility most notably in and out of Tamale in Ghanaâ s north Ghanaâ s dry season remains the best time of the year for wildlife sightings especially from December to March the countryâ s driest months This is when youâ ll find the elephants of Mole National Park and other reserves gathering around any remaining watering holes with a more barren landscape making it easier to spot monkeys hyenas and buffalos March is typically Ghanaâ s hottest month though rains can occur and provide a cooling respite at any time Colorful festivals take place throughout Ghana during the harvest and dry seasons Â Yaayi Shutterstock September to November means harvest festivals and smaller crowds While theyâ re still a part of the rainy season September and October are when most travelers from Europe and North America have already come and gone and the countryâ s harvest festivals are starting up This is an ideal time to visit Ghanaâ s north which has been consistently cooled by rains By November the rains have stopped in the south but the Sahara winds havenâ t quite kicked in All three months are a good time to visit for those looking for smaller crowds relatively decent weather and ample events Advertisement April to August is the rainy season and popular with vacationers from Europe and North America The low season in Ghana is the wet season a time that can be humid and sticky but with cooler temperatures and a lush explosion of greenery Rains can consist of anything from a passing shower to a days long monsoon Inland travels can be restricted during this time because of flooded roadways but thereâ s still plenty to see and do in the countryâ s outer regions In Ghanaâ s southern half April May and June are some of the wettest months of the year The rains then abate slightly through July and August though showers are still common before starting back up in September and into October With relatively clear skies and ample greenery this is a good time for photography Up in the countryâ s north the rains are continuous and can cool temperatures down making the weather more bearable However this is also when mosquitoes are most frequent so be sure to take extra precaution Even though these rainy months are Ghanaâ s low season the country still sees an increase of European and North American travelers between June and August Ghanaâ s coolest month so book your flights and accommodations early It s easier to spot wildlife during Ghanaâ s dry season particularly December to March Â Frans Lanting Getty Images Spot wildlife in January As the Harmattan winds rear their dusty head January has the least rainfall in the country overall Wildlife sightings are abundant Key event Edina Bronya Keep the binoculars handy in February The Harmattan winds remain active as does the wildlifeâ â which tends to crowd around watering holes in places like Mole National Park Key event Dzawuwu It s very hot in Ghana in March March is Ghanaâ s hottest month though the rains can begin anytime The north also experiences squalls strong sudden winds that only last for a few minutes Key event Independence Day By the end of the dry season Ghanaians are eagerly awaiting the rains Â Gerhard Pettersson Shutterstock The rains finally arrive in April April marks the official start of the wet season and Ghanaâ s low season Heavy rains can often wash out roads especially in the central part of the country though reliable infrastructure makes most roads safe to travel Key event Dipo Days are wet and temperatures are cooler in May Rains are typically heavy in May especially in the countryâ s center and south Temperatures are a bit cooler as well Key event Aboakyir Accra gets busier in June Typically Ghanaâ s wettest month and still the low season June is also when travelers from Europe and North America start arriving for their summer vacations making cities like Accra especially busy Key event Dzimbi Festival The north is cooler in July The rain often takes a break in southern Ghana in July and tourism from Western countries remains high Itâ s a good time for visiting both Ghanaâ s northern and southern regions because the weather is a bit cooler up north and days are typically warm and dry in areas like Accra and the Cape Coast Key events Republic Day Bakatue Festival PANAFEST August is Ghana s coldest month Although the rains remain on standby in southern Ghana August is traditionally the countryâ s windiest and coldest month European and American tourists are still here in droves and PANAFEST typically continues into the month in odd numbered years Key events Chale Wote Street Art Festival Homowo Colorful processions are a hallmark of Ghanaâ s many annual festivals including Fetu Afahye on the Cape Coast Â MyLoupe Getty Images Celebrate the harvest in September Most Western travelers have dispersed in September and although the rains have started back up again in the south itâ s time for the harvest festivals to begin Up north the rains continue but the air is cooler and more tolerable than in other months Key event Fetu Afahye October is one of the best times to visit Ghanaâ s overall climate remains cooler and less humid and the Harmattan winds are still a ways off Harvest festivals are in full swing and the rains have essentially stopped in southern Ghana and are winding down in the north October is a great month to visit Key event Ngmayem The fair weather continues all across Ghana in November November is another good month to visit The rains dissipate in the south and end in the north and the weather is still relatively cool and less humid The Harmattan winds are getting ready to blow but they often have yet to arrive Key event Hogbetsotso Join the returning Ghanaian diaspora in December As the Ghanaian diaspora flies home to celebrate Christmas December sees lots of celebrating and merrymaking though some shops are closed so that families can be together For a local feel December is a good month to visit While the Sahara winds have most likely picked up so have the wildlife sightings in the north as more animals make their way toward the limited number of watering holes Key events Farmersâ Day Christmas Afrochella Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Ghana Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For
