this Lonely Planet writer youâ re a hardcore Harry Potter fan add a little magic into the mix and let your favourite characters inspire your next trip Where will your next trip take you Â Ingus Kruklitis Shutterstock Advertisement Do you consider yourself a Hermione Granger or more of a Harry Potter Do your pals think youâ re the Ron Weasley of the group or gulp the Draco Malfoy Wherever your allegiance lies use your spellbinding personality traits for good and find out which destination you should accio to your bucket list Not sure which Potter personality you most resemble Take our quiz to find out Avoid the Dursleys when you visit Suffolk Â Ron Ellis Shutterstock Harry Potter â Suffolk UK or Bolivia Even the Sorting Hat had trouble placing this character of conflict who toes the line between good and evil Brave headstrong and stubborn this wild spirit also has a deep connection to home For the Potters of this world we suggest splitting your time between nostalgic escapes in Suffolk and adrenaline fuelled adventures in Bolivia Explore the half timbered medieval houses of Lavenham that inspired the setting for Godrickâ s Hollow Snap a shot of De Vere House which featured in the films as Harryâ s birthplace â reportedly itâ s the second most photographed building in the UK after Downing Street When you ve had your fill of Suffolk indulge in a spot of sandboarding ziplining or jaguar spotting in Bolivia Like Harry dance with death along Boliviaâ s aptly named â Death Roadâ This infamous cycle route has over miles of spine tingling cliff edge road guaranteed to leave you feeling like the Boy â or Girl â Who Lived Embrace your inner calm at Lake Bled Â Natalia Deriabina Shutterstock Ron Weasley â Croatia or Slovenia Rons may be rough around the edges but these happy go lucky souls are loyal to a fault and love spending time with their friends Growing up as one of seven children however means that while company is appreciated a trip that encourages peace and quiet should be on the cards Retreat to the calm coastal beauty of Northern Dalmatia Croatia where you and your pals can hole up in an understated waterfront villa before island hopping to some of the countryâ s lesser visited spots like Cres Silba and Pag â the latter being the motherland of the eponymous cheese a perfect port for snack fiends like our favourite redhead Rons would also flourish in laidback Slovenia where rustic glamping options get you out into the mountains or to the shores of Lake Bled â where better to enjoy a game of Wizard Chess among friends The world is your oyster if you re a Granger Â Dima Zel Shutterstock Hermione Granger â everywhere In her third year at Hogwarts this knowledge hungry Gryffindor couldnâ t even pick between school subjects so one or two destinations just isnâ t going to cut it If you too have a brilliant bookish brain explore the world in an encyclopaedic fashion with a round the world trip Time Turner not included Advertisement Grangers will revel in the months of research planning and booking necessary to explore the four corners of the globe And as keen activists best known for their work championing the rights of House Elves will relish the additional challenge of trying to off set their carbon footprint by utilising train networks or biking and hiking instead of flying camping at various locations and using eco friendly products and services along the way Itâ s going to involve a lot more homework but who doesnâ t love extra assignments Embracing luxury is the Malfoy way Â Food Travel Stockforlife Shutterstock Draco Malfoy â Maldives Beneath his brash exterior lies a lost soul and a kind heart â he did come around to the right side in the end Having grown up in a huge manor house with a small fortune to play with Draco is not one to suffer the drudgeries of everyday life Fellow Malfoys should make for the Maldives and indulge in an all inclusive luxury break Do you deserve it Probably not But hey youâ ve got the cash to burn As Mother Natureâ s sunken garden the Maldives offer unparalleled underwater experiences Since scuba diving is somewhat meditative perhaps this activity might afford our reformed renegades the chance to reflect on their past misconduct Lean into your inner Luna on a yoga retreat in India Â ManuelfromMadrid Shutterstock Luna Lovegood â India Lunas march to the beat of their own drum This gentle hearted non conformist is also a pillar of zen despite having her possessions frequently pinched by the other students she philosophises that the â things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end if not always in the way we expect â If you align with Luna let her free thinking ways lead you to a wellness escape in India This is the motherland of yoga retreats Mysuru in Karnataka the birthplace of ashtanga yoga has centres citywide or visit International Centre for Yoga Education and Research in Tamil Nadu for comprehensive day to six month courses Restore balance in your mind body and soul with an ayurvedic treatment or connect with Lunaâ s philosophical side by attending a Bhuddist meditation at one of the centres in Himachal Pradesh Explore the delights of Margate with your very own Fawkes Â Lee Rogers Getty Images Dumbledore â Margate UK According to his Chocolate Frog Card Dumbledore is considered by many to be the greatest wizard of modern times who also enjoys chamber music and ten pin bowling Sure heâ s the only person Voldemort ever feared but we remember this enigmatic man for his love of Sherbert Lemons woolly socks and of course his beloved phoenix Fawkes Discerning Dumbledores were therefore made for Margate on Englandâ s south coast This vintage seaside town has risen from the ashes as a top tourist spot and is equal parts camp kitsch and full of curiosities Visit the inexplicable Grade I listed Shell Grotto why and by whom it was built is unknown have lunch on the top deck of Rosie the Bus Cafe or spend a day on the beach Donâ t leave without testing your powers and your stomach on one of the retro rides at the revamped Dreamland theme park Embrace nature just like Newt in Borneo Â yusnizam Getty Images Newt Scamander â Borneo or Madagascar Your fascination for fantastical beasts has already taken you halfway across the planet researching elusive Bowtruckles in Germanyâ s forests and dodging highly dangerous Lethifolds in Papua New Guinea For their next adventure Scamanders should explore the equatorial rainforests of Borneo or the plus endemic species of Madagascar Borneoâ s forests are some of the most wildlife rich on earth but the drawcard is their fiery haired occupants no the Weasleyâ s havenâ t emigrated their native colonies of orangutans See them in the wild at Batang Ai National Park by guided tour only or visit the heart stoppingly cute outdoor nursery at world famous Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre Madagascar has almost mythical status when it comes to wildlife dive the kaleidoscopic reefs stand in the shadow of magical baobabs and spot species of lemur in Parc National Andasibe Mantadia Dolores Umbridge â Tokyo Japan She may not be your favourite character but you canâ t deny that Dolores Umbridge leaves a mark literally in Harryâ s case A devotee of order and a collector of â Frolicsome Feline platesâ with a flare for embellished frocks any Umbridges out there will love Tokyo with its cat cafes and bubble gum fashion districts Tokyo is sleek serious and well structured The trains here run on time and smart signposting makes it a breeze to get around Beyond the well oiled infrastructure get a pop of iconic pink frills at the Harajuku and Aoyama shopping district before lunch at a restaurant staffed by robots They may have originated in Taiwan but cat cafes were puurfected in Tokyo If youâ re anything like Dolores youâ ll want to get your furry fix at stunningly designed Mocha Lounge Ikebukuro or Asakusa Nekoen which rehabilitates stray cats for permanent adoption Read more Where to travel based on your Harry Potter house Where to travel based on your Chinese zodiac sign From Hogwarts to
