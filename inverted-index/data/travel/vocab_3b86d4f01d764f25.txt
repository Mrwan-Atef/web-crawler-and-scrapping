West An unexpected kinship with the wild landscapes of the West inspires a US park ranger to find peace and a place to call home in America s subalpine zone By Catherine Raven December min read This article was adapted from National Geographic Traveller UK The first time I hiked the Highline Trail in Glacier National Park Montana I fell under the spell of subalpine country the cool largely coniferous biotic zone in western North America Patches of mist danced like fairies shining the sedge grass with tiny droplets of water and gentling the sun s rays A couple of miles later down the trail a mountain goat looked down from a rock ledge at a sight that was fairly uncommon in the a girl hiking alone Tilting our heads in unison we each studied a rare creature from a new angle we gazed into each other s eyes mine almond shaped and brown hers perfectly round and black Several years later working as a backcountry ranger in Mount Rainier National Park in Washington state I was hiking uphill on the Wonderland Trail when I crested a rise and entered subalpine country and promptly found myself knee deep in purple lupine Several feet ahead on a stage of pink heath with the white grey dome of Mount Rainier for a backdrop a chunky mountain goat kid pushed his head under a tiny fir tree and peeked at me I was so astounded I stopped breathing Between my first and second encounter with mountain goats I d visited the most astounding scenery in the American West But the goat gave me something the physical world couldn t recognition and acceptance The feeling of communicating across a species boundary sank into my soul When I started working for the US National Park Service the Wonderland Trail heading into Indian Bar from Stevens Canyon was one of the wildest places in America In Congress designated the area a Wilderness with a capital W an honour not yet achieved by Glacier National Park And wild it was I slept in bivy sacks far off the trail I hiked cross country unrestricted by man made routes and forged streams unrestricted by man made bridges At first I thought these freedoms would make me tougher and that I d become conqueror in the inevitable girl vs nature battle Instead I slipped into Mount Rainier s wilderness unnoticed abruptly cognisant of my lack of prowess Still I worshipped Rainier and not just because I wasn t brave enough to climb her highest peaks and rappel into her deepest crevasses It was the sense of community Travelling cross country breaking the barrier between humans and animals we were a society of wild things Me the goats and all our living neighbours were a fellowship akin to Tolkien s hobbits elves dwarves and man But instead of wizards the white bearded mountain goats gave the area its unique magic Oreamnos americanos mountain goats aren t closely related to their domestic cousins but are truly wild As a ranger while I replanted damaged campsites curious goats gathered around me When I pitched a tent in a circle of hemlock and fir they lay beside me When they sneezed I called out Gesundheit Drawn to land without a human watermark but not wanting to be alone the subalpine became my favourite home not for its beauty but because of the goats As a biology student I understood that this landscape where plants surrendered to wind sun and ice before disappearing into rocky alpine peaks marked life s last stand Empathising with mountain goats changed my view I saw instead a land where wind sculpts fir trees into whimsical shapes and where goats thrive Only when threatened by predators will they flee to the suboptimal alpine zone Now when I hike down from a mountain summit I see life restored The subalpine isn t where life ends but where it begins I manage my own land now At dawn today in my home in Montana a doe and two spotted fawns greeted me a skunk waddles near my feet most evenings and for several years my best friend was a wild red fox In Fox I An Uncommon Friendship I tell the story of nurturing the land and befriending the wild animals of America and why I m making my own tiny spot in a place where a wild animal or even just a butterfly can feel at home Catherine Raven is
