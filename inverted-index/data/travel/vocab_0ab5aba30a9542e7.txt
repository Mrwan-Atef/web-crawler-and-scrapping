Sep min read Share From avoiding the crowds to getting the best budget deal here s what s happening through the seasons in California Â Artur Debat Getty Images Enormous California with its booming economy bounty of nature agriculture and vibrant cities could be a country unto itself Advertisement Thereâ s a season for everything as the song goes so whether you come for the sun surf skiing or culture here s a guide to the best times to visit the Golden State Outside Lands takes over San Francisco s Golden Gate Park in August Â C Flanigan WireImage June to August is the best time for beaches and festivals California is about miles long â the UK could fit inside California one and half times over â so the state s weather varies immensely from north to south During summer from San Diego to Santa Barbara the nearly continuous ribbon of beaches is thronged and the Pacific is warm In the SoCal desert June through August is notoriously hot while the San Francisco Bay Area can be famously chilly because of its summer fog Regardless travelers roam in droves while school is out and this is when you can expect the busiest beaches the most expensive hotel rooms and the biggest crowds For the entire month of June California celebrates LGBTIQ pride especially in San Francisco which sets the global standard Advertisement California s campgrounds beaches and theme parks hit peak popularity especially on the July holiday â summerâ s biggest travel weekend The California State Fair brings pie eating contests craft beer competitions championship hogs carnival rides and much more to Sacramento later in July Also in late July Comic Con â the nationâ s biggest annual convention of comic book fans hardcore pop culture collectors and sci fi and anime devotees affectionately known as Nerd Prom â brings out of this world costumed madness to San Diego San Franciscoâ s Summer of Love roots underpin the Outside Lands music and comedy bacchanalia that takes over Golden Gate Park in August California s vineyards erupt in golden and orange hues in fall Â Getty Images iStockphoto April to May and September to October are the best times for outdoor activities In the spring as wildflower season peaks in the high desert the southern desert bursts into song at Coachella Music Festival and San Francisco twinkles with international celebrities as the nation s oldest film festival lights up with star studded US premieres of hundreds of films from around the globe usually during two weeks in April Early autumn is also a spectacular time In wine country vineyards erupt in an ocean of golden orange and magenta hues from Sonoma and Napa to Paso Robles On the Northern California coast summertime fog retreats and balmy days become the norm Fall is also when the Central Coast starts to warm up and the heat in SoCal finally breaks Fall festivals include the storied Monterey Jazz Festival and many wine country harvest festivals With students back in their seats at school shoulder season is prime time for visiting California s national parks or exploring the beaches And in the Sierras early winter storms in November can blanket the mountains in snow giving winter sports fans an early start to the ski season Shoulder season also offers lower hotel prices and accommodation availability goes up statewide Cooler temps in the desert make winter a great time to hike Â Getty Images iStockphoto November to March is the best time to avoid the crowds Winter in California is famously mild especially in the south but you can still find killer powder on the peaks and whale watching on the coast Winter â particularly December and January â is a prime time to spot whales offshore as they migrate south to their seasonal home in Baja California Accommodation rates will be lowest along the coast and this is a perfect opportunity to visit California s deserts January is the wettest month in California and a slow time for coastal travel â but this is when mountain ski resorts and Southern California deserts hit their stride The famous New Yearâ s parade held before the Tournament of Roses college football game draws more than spectators to the LA suburb of Pasadena As spring approaches California sunshine breaks through the drizzle skiers hit the slopes in T shirts and wildflowers begin to bloom And the cooler temps in the desert make it a great time to hike in Joshua Tree and Death Valley Winter is also the season to see thousands of monarch butterflies warming up in California groves and find colonies of elephant seals nursing pups in Central Coast dunes Meanwhile after wintering in South America the swallows return to Mission San Juan Capistrano in Orange County around March â and the historic mission town celebrates its Spanish and Mexican heritage all month long Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address Subscribe now Subscribe to Lonely
