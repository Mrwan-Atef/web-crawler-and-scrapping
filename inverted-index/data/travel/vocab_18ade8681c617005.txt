a commemoration of Lewis and Clark s epic expedition and most recently a national park Redesignated on February the former Jefferson National Expansion Memorial s new status confuses many At urban acres the United States national park doesn t resemble its fellows But massive renovations and a state of the art American history museum highlight the significance of this monumental landmark Here s how to plan for your next visit Why go now Something new million went into renovating the Arch and laying out acres of waterfront green space laced with walking trails Interpretive signs dot the paths which connect to downtown St Louis to make the Arch more accessible than ever before The massive changes are worthy of the area s upgraded status A parking garage is now an amphitheater a pedestrian bridge now crosses the interstate The glassy futuristic visitor center complements its interior a complex homage to the country s complex past much like the Arch itself See the view from the top It took seven years million and tons of stainless steel to build the world s largest man made arch Though you can t climb its steps a four minute tram ride after a longer wait in line takes you up through the arch s hollow legs to the foot high viewing booth A clear day offers mile views over the St Louis skyline and the Mississippi River You re welcome to stay at the top for as long as you like But you ll probably also want to see the Arch from its many angles including on a one hour Mississippi riverboat cruise or via helicopter tour Same day tickets are available but consider advance reservations in the busy summer months Mississippi River flooding has temporarily suspended riverboat and helicopter tours which are expected to resume in June Walk through history In Thomas Jefferson

of its kind in the country brings each visitor into that hard to grasp mindset Its six distinct sections are part new age Oregon Trail and part reality check To fulfill Jefferson s plans of westward expansion this land was taken by force from Native peoples many times over The museum reminds visitors that Jefferson s dream was a dream for some but not all Visit other great park museums in North America The forced displacement of Native peoples isn t the only dark chapter of American history the national park confronts St Louis Old Courthouse a short walk to the Arch through the park s new trail network memorializes the scene of two landmark cases Dred Scott v Sandford which argued for African Americans equality and Virginia Minor v Happersett which argued for women s rights Both cases lost Venture inside to see the ornate rotunda the restored courtrooms or listen to a talk from a park ranger Museum admission is included with any tram ride ticket Certain ticket packages include the minute documentary Monument to the Dream which shows footage from the construction in a gripping reminder that men built the structure in the wind and rain hundreds of feet in the air with a razor thin margin for error Eat drink and stay North of the park grounds you ll find Laclede s Landing the oldest district in the city now full of renovated warehouses and riverfront patios For dining with
