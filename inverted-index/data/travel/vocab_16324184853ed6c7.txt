surf at Praia dos Mosteiros SÃ o Miguel the Azores Nessa Gnatoush Shutterstock Visitors to the Azores â the gorgeous volcanic islands in the Atlantic miles from mainland Portugal â can savor beaches of all types On some islands youâ ll find ocean pools the ocean waves have naturally carved into the coastal tuff or perhaps soft black sand beaches Sometimes localsâ favorite swimming spots have a mix of both For travelers used to scorching weather the often blusterly Azores might feel a bit cold for swimming â but the climate just takes some getting used to Beach going weather in the summer can last a whole month but you can expect that to be interspersed with showers that turn up humidity levels up to Advertisement The one thing that can dampen your beach plans for the day Finding a large patch of jellyfish in the ocean or washing over the sand Portuguese man oâ wars are particularly dangerous and are being spotted more frequently every year Yet even with that potential hazard youâ re almost guaranteed to enjoy these top beaches in the Azores The black volcanic sands of Praia dos Mosteiros on SÃ o Miguel Nessa Gnatoush Shutterstock Praia dos Mosteiros SÃ o Miguel Most popular beach On SÃ o Miguelâ s west coast about miles from Ponta Delgada Praia dos Mosteiros gets busy on the weekends during peak season On site facilities a bus stop within walking distance and free parking only steps from the stretch of sand make it the perfect spot for a full day on the sand and in the sun Local tip Experienced surfers waves break into the rocks here will find this one of the best spots on the island to catch some waves The PoÃ o do Bacalhau waterfall at FajÃ Grande Flores the Azores Shutterstock FajÃ Grande Flores Best beach for sunsets On the west coast of Flores FajÃ Grande is a favorite destination for locals in the summer with many having a second home there to spend on weekends The beach is a small patch of black sand wedged between the old port and the cliffs close to restaurants cafes picnic areas and a free parking lot For younger kids who havenâ t yet learned how to swim yet a shallow pool near the beach restaurant is ideal for splashing around Local tip Many locals spend the entire day here staying to enjoy the sunset from Europeâ s westernmost point Praia Grande Terceira Best city beach Advertisement One of the largest beaches in the Azores and one of the most popular swimming spots on Terceira Praia Grande lies right below Praia da s seaside avenue in the historic center When the weather isn t favorable for lounging on the beach plenty of people set out exercising and on oceanside walks instead With fewer currents and warmer waters than elsewhere on the island expect this city beach to be more crowded in the summer Planning tip If you have a stopover of at least four hours in Terceira grab a cab and head to Praia Grande for a quick dip or a stroll past the street art murals â then return to the airport in time for your flight The city of Praia da is just miles from Terceira airport The picture perfect PoÃ a SimÃ o Dias a natural swimming pool on SÃ o Jorge Sebastian Adobe Stock PoÃ a SimÃ o Dias SÃ o Jorge Best â beachâ for fabulous views The most popular natural swimming pool on SÃ o Jorge PoÃ a SimÃ o Dias is accessed via a short but rugged rock path Most come to photograph the clear turquoise waters that contrast with the black basalt coast and the vegetation covered hills if this is your plan come in the morning before the crowds in search of swimming and sun seeking arrive The pointy rocks around the pool have very few spots suitable for laying down a towel which makes PoÃ a SimÃ o Dias a better spot for quick dips and snorkeling Planning tip Afternoons when the sun starts peeking out from behind the cliff and warming up the water are best for swimming With calm sheltered water Praia de Porto on Faial is perfect for families Sergio Nogueira Getty Images Praia de Porto Pim Faial Best beach for families Protected by the Monte da Guia hill and an old defense wall and a short drive from the center of Horta Praia de Porto Pim is a favorite of families on Faial Its calm waters and proximity to cafes and restaurants make it a popular spot even outside the beach season Local tip In Hurricane Lorenzo heavily damaged this small stretch of sand â yet the beach has been slowly returning to its former Blue Flag state Praia da Areia Sand Beach is just a short walk from the center of Vila Nova do Corvo mtcurado Getty Images Praia da Areia Corvo Best beach for swimming Corvo the smallest island in the archipelago has only one sand beach aptly named Praia da Areia Sand Beach Compared to those on other islands this stretch of coarse black rock slopes gently into the ocean so you can ease into the water without feeling that sudden loss of ground beneath your feet And the water here is warmer than elsewhere in the archipelago Like everything else on Corvo the beach is within walking distance from the town center roughly and right at the end of the airportâ s runway With only one or two daily flights the noise of planes will hardly ruin the beach going experience Lie out or swim in the natural pools at Porto do Carapacho on Graciosa JosÃ LuÃ s Ã vila Silveira Pedro Noronha e Costa Carapacho Graciosa Best beach for wellness Protected from the ocean by a nature made low wall of rocks the calm turquoise waters of the natural pools at Carapacho on Graciosa stay at a pleasant temperature practically all year long Unless that is if the currents are too strong for a safe swim While this village in the southeast is more popular during the thermal season typically from May to September visitors head to Termas do Carapacho just steps away all year long It is believed that the water in both the natural pools and the thermal baths has healing properties A native of the Azores Sandra Henriques is the author of the Lonely Planetâ s new Pocket Azores
