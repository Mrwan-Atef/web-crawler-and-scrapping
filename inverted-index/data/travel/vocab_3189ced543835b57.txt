Mackenzie Nov min read Share The Grand Egyptian Museum GEM in Cairo is now open to visitors Here s what you need to know Tamer A Soliman Shutterstock The Grand Egyptian Museum GEM finally opened to the public on October Covering an area of square metres sq ft â or about soccer fields this is the worldâ s largest archaeological museum complex dedicated to a single civilization Fronted by a spectacular alabaster and glass facade the complex is decorated with different sizes and colors of triangles â an ode to Ancient Egypt Even the stones over which water tinkles in the shallow rectangular pools that decorate the vast esplanade between the ticket office and the main building are pyramidal Advertisement The top of the building lies level with the Pyramids of Giza plateau and descends to the Nile Valley where the principal entrance for visitors lies The GEM complex is open every day from to The galleries however open at and shut at The newly opened Grand Egyptian Museum is the largest archaeological museum in the world Tamer A Soliman Shutterstock When did the Grand Egyptian Museum project begin The building was designed by an Irish firm Heneghan Peng Architects who beat competitors from countries to win the Egyptian Ministry of Cultureâ s competition to create a museum complex to house display and preserve the tens of thousands of ancient treasures in its trust Construction began in but the Arab Spring brought work to a halt throughout the three years of political instability that followed Tourist numbers dropped sharply during this period resulting in a corresponding drop in income for the government But from onwards work was able to resume on the project with considerable financial and technical help from Japan And now finally it is open You may hear that the GEM is only â partially openâ and thatâ s because the Tutankhamen treasures have not yet been moved into their two galleries from the historic Egyptian Museum downtown and the two â Solarâ boats are not yet in their assigned places But apart from these the museumâ s other galleries are open and the yr old tonne statue of Ramses II can finally welcome visitors into the vast atrium six years after he arrived there himself How do I get to the Grand Egyptian Museum from Cairo For the moment the only way to get there is by Uber or taxi or by hiring a driver or joining a tour Sometime in the future there will be a metro stop at the site which will make it easy to reach from downtown Cairo For the time being itâ s a bit tricky getting here by public transport I tried by taking the metro to Cairo University the closest stop and from there I had to walk along a busy highway to the main University gate for an Uber to find me and drive me the remaining miles to the GEM This trip cost me â or US and probably wouldnâ t have cost much more for the extra miles from the city centre Donâ t even try taking one of the local microbuses unless you speak Egyptian You may find it hard to get an Uber from the museum because the internet connection outside is spotty and many drivers still don t know where the pick up location is but you may be able to grab a taxi that s just dropped somebody off or you can use the more expensive or â or US museum limo service from outside the ticket office to return to your accommodation at the end of your visit Where do you buy tickets and what are the opening hours for GEM Despite what you may have read elsewhere I was assured by senior museum staff that there is no cap on the number of visitors per day It is vast enough to be able to absorb huge numbers of visitors You can buy your ticket online but there is no need You can purchase it at the ticket booths credit cards only no cash at the entrance You cannot buy a ticket after for a visit the same day Advertisement In November the cost for an adult over the age of was â or US and children aged four to was half that Entry is free for children under If you want a guided tour the fee is â or US The entry fee for Egyptian nationals is â or US for an adult between the ages of and and half that for everyone else As a result Egyptians flock here on the weekends Friday Saturday Pyramid motifs dominate the exterior and interior of the Grand Egyptian Museum GEM design Tamer A Soliman Shutterstock How much time should I spend in the Grand Egyptian Museum If youâ re in a hurry and want to combine a visit to the GEM with the Pyramids of Giza just miles away â youâ ll eventually be able to walk between the two when the pedestrian walkway is completed â then visit the Giza pyramids first while itâ s cool and the sun is behind you If you visit in the later afternoon the sun sets behind the sphinx and all youâ ll see is a silhouette You can then have lunch at the GEM and spend the hottest time of the day in the museumâ s cool interior If you want to take your time then count on spending most of the day in the GEM You may find it a lot less tiring than visiting older museums largely because of the excellent acoustics which absorb most of the noise What will I see in the Grand Egyptian Museum The galleries are arranged in three pillars Society Kingship and Beliefs each of which is divided into four groups of periods The first covers the era between c BC combining the Prehistoric Predynastic and Early Dynastic Periods together with the Old Kingdom and the First Intermediate Period The second spans the period from c BC covering the Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period The third covers the New Kingdom c BC The fourth covers the Third Intermediate the Late and the Greco Roman Periods spanning from c BC AD The visitor flow is very well thought out so if for example you are only interested in the history of Kingship then start your visit in gallery and just walk straight ahead down the length of the building through galleries and which all deal with Kingship If on the other hand youâ re interested in Society and Kingship and Beliefs during the New Kingdom then you start in gallery and walk across the building into galleries and Each gallery is clearly numbered and has a plan that shows you where you are making it very easy to plan your visit by period or by theme or just to simply wander Thereâ s no need for a paper floor plan â and in any case none is available At the information points youâ ll just be pointed to a QR code that you need to download If you donâ t have a local SIM card it could be expensive the museum apparently has wifi but I didnâ t find it Labelling is also well thought out the print in English Arabic and braille on the information panels is big making it easy to read the panels are sloped so there are no reflections from overhead lighting and even more importantly the information is short sharp and to the point and never takes more than a minute to absorb At the right of each display case youâ ll see a panel with a colored background That will give you an overview of the general subject in that display case the role of High Priests for example The panels with a grey or white background give you details about specific artifacts in that case Artifacts that have never been put on public display before will be exhibited at GEM Maciek Grabowicz Shutterstock What is missing from the GEM For the moment you wonâ t see anything to do with Tutankhamen and that is why it is not yet â officiallyâ open When the geo political situation in the Middle East seems appropriate then the Egyptian authorities will allow the Tutankhamen treasures to be moved here from their present home in the Egyptian Museum on Tahrir Square in central Cairo That day will mark the official opening of the GEM Museum authorities told me the visitor experience walking through the Tutankhamen galleries will give a flavor of what it was like in the tomb and that many artifacts which have never been put on public display before will be exhibited here In addition you will not see any royal mummies To see those you need to go to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization where they are displayed in the Mummies Hall Can I take photographs in the GEM No or at least not with cameras with removable lenses Tripods photography camera lights any type of professional recording equipment or drones are also prohibited And if you have any of this equipment with you it will be detected when you go through the security screening just after youâ ve bought your ticket Youâ ll be asked to leave it for no fee at the security office You can take photographs with a mobile phone for your personal use Combine a visit to the Pyramids of Giza with the nearby GEM requires some forward planning Getty Images Is the GEM accessible Yes And everyone gets to the galleriesâ entrance from the same place on the left of the atrium For those who want to admire the stone objects that line the monumental staircase you wander up the steps to the top from which there is a spectacular view of the Giza pyramids and the entrance to the galleries For those who are in a hurry to get into the galleries or have infants in strollers for example you can use the moving walkway that rises slowly just alongside the right of the steps For those with mobility issues there is a platform between the rising and descending walkways onto which a wheelchair can be pushed Wheelchairs are available at the ticket office What should I wear to visit the GEM Like anywhere else in Egypt dress conservatively and as the museum is air conditioned youâ ll probably want a light sweater or jacket â and comfy shoes of course Can I eat and shop in the Grand Egyptian Museum In the atrium opposite the monumental staircase youâ ll find a food hall with Zooba North Bitter Sweet Starbucks Dolato and LadurÃ e Apart from the museum shop which sells souvenirs and books there are three upmarket jewellery shops and one Atef Wassef a family owned silversmiths which sells in house designed modern affordable silver jewellery Thereâ s also a handbag shop and a carpet store Others shops will most likely fill the few retail spaces still available at the time I visited Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real
