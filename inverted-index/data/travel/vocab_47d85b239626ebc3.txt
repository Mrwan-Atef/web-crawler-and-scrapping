before you go to Bermuda Bradley Olson Shutterstock Thereâ s more to Bermuda than that triangle you guys are so obsessed about Usually lumped with the Caribbean islands to the south Bermuda is located in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of North Carolina Despite its proximity to the United States Bermuda is a British Overseas Territory filled with culture and charm Known for its pink sand beaches a Bermuda vacation can be almost whatever you want it to be History buff Got you covered Beach lover Some of the best in the world Nature enthusiasts Weâ ve got plenty of that too Foodie There s plenty to keep your tastebuds happy here Bermuda is a great place to vacation no matter what youâ re looking for When should I go to Bermuda Because of Bermudaâ s location itâ s not the year round warm destination many people think it is Yes it can be super hot and humid but only for half the year Advertisement If lazing on the beach in the heat isnâ t appealing consider visiting between November and April The weather will be cooler to but there are many things to do aside from enjoying the beach including Butterfield Bermuda Championship Christmas festivities Restaurant Weeks and whale watching If you are coming to Bermuda specifically for our gorgeous beaches May to October is the best time to visit The busiest time on the island is from June to September â which also happens to be in the middle of hurricane season Note hotels and flights will be the most costly during this time period But the summer months are the best time to visit in my opinion especially if you enjoy lots of activities Bermuda Day is the last Friday in May Carnival in Bermuda is held over Fatherâ s Day Weekend in June The absolute best event of all is Cup Match the celebration of emancipation either the last Thursday and Friday in July or the first Thursday and Friday in August The island shuts from Wednesday to Sunday and celebrates with a two day cricket match Cup Match truly is Bermuda at its best How much time should I spend in Bermuda The great thing about Bermuda is that if you only have a weekend you can have a fantastic time depending on what you want to do The islandâ s close proximity to the US makes for short flights so that you can maximize your time However if you have more time I highly recommend at least five days or a week to immerse yourself into all that Bermuda has to offer Getting around is easy with good public transport including ferries buses and taxis Moment Open Getty Images Is it easy to get in and around Bermuda Getting to Bermuda from the US UK and Canada is easy as there are many direct flights The closest major city is New York with a minute flight from JFK offered daily on multiple airlines Other direct flights include Boston Atlanta Philadelphia Toronto Miami Orlando Halifax and London Advertisement Once you get into Bermuda itâ s easy to grab a taxi at the LF Wade International AIrport however pre arranging will make your life easier Check out CEO Transport for great rates and service Public transportation is relatively inexpensive and reliable The bus system runs all over the island from to midnight and there is an efficient ferry service as well The bus and ferry tickets are interchangeable each so you wonâ t need to decide in advance which service to utilize Once you are outside of the main city of Hamilton or the town of St Georgeâ s Bermuda is not walkable The roads are very narrow and windy and walking is not recommended Visit to St George s for history but also the gorgeous beach at Tobacco Bay Getty Images Top things to do in Bermuda Visit St Georgeâ s Iâ m from St Georgeâ s so Iâ m very biased Every single person who comes to Bermuda should visit the former capital and oldest part of the island St Georgeâ s has narrow cobblestone streets beautiful old buildings the oldest church in the western hemisphere St Peterâ s built in and is a UNESCO World Heritage site If you prefer beaches head over to Tobacco Bay and Fort St Catherine For eats check out Temptations or Wahooâ s Bistro for excellent seafood To immerse yourself in a cultural experience book a tour with award winning company Long Story Short Laze on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world Bermuda may be small but visitors are spoiled for choice when it comes to gorgeous beaches The South Shore has some of the best beaches and the most popular is Horseshoe Bay but as it tends to be overrun with tourists I canâ t recommend it Elbow Beach is a great alternative less than minutes away or for great snorkeling check out Church Bay minutes west If you want true relaxation on a gorgeous stretch of beach with hardly anyone else go to Cooperâ s Island in St Davidâ s Itâ s in a nature reserve so youâ ll need to bring food and drinks with you When you get there you will experience one of the most gorgeous beaches youâ ve ever seen Don t leave Bermuda without trying a classic fish sandwich Shutterstock Enjoy a fish sandwich Bermuda has an abundance of fresh fish and one of our favorite ways to enjoy it is deep fried and loaded high on a sandwich A typical Bermuda fish sandwich is on toasted raisin bread with fried fish coleslaw and tartar sauce The kind of fish will vary but itâ s typically wahoo or snapper The best version is debatable but trust me here â you want the fish sandwich at Mama Mia or if youâ re in the west Woodyâ s Have a rum swizzle Bermuda is known for its rum swizzle and various restaurants and bars across the Island have their own version Rum Swizzle is what we call rum punch and itâ s typically made from dark rum light rum orange juice pineapple juice bitters and a splash of grenadine For an old school version visit Swizzle Inn For my favorite head to Wahooâ s Bistro in St Georgeâ s One of the best things you can do in Bermuda is get out on the water Wangkun Jia Shutterstock My favorite thing to do in Bermuda My absolute favorite thing to do in Bermuda is to go out on a boat whether it s during the day for a swimming charter or a sunset cruise Thereâ s nothing more magical than seeing the beauty of Bermuda by boat and thankfully there are plenty of options whether you want to charter your own Boston Whaler or join a bigger boat One of the more popular swimming areas is Paradise Lakes where the water is calm and youâ re surrounded by private islands Restless Native and Ubervida both offer private and group charters How much money do I need for Bermuda The Bermuda dollar is one to one with the US dollar so that makes Bermuda more expensive than other island destinations During the summer months more luxurious resorts can charge over per night for a room Hotel rooms a night high season low season Fine dining per person budget Public transport one way Private taxis to depending on location Cocktails to Cup of Coffee to Fish sandwich to Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order
