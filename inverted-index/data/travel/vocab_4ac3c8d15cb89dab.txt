tectonic shifting of the Pacific plate The peaks rise beside the San Andreas Rift Zone which slices through Bear Valley just east of the park boundary Highway roughly parallels the faultline Indigenous people have lived in the valleys that bracket the park for centuries and members of the Chalon and Amah Matsun still work closely with park staff volunteering their time and expertise on cultural and environmental projects at Pinnacles Spanish settlers established the mission system through the region in settlements and churches from the period still stand just west of the park in Soledad as well as nearby in San Juan Bautista and out on the coast in Carmel and Santa Cruz Native peoples Spaniards and following California statehood in white homesteaders farmed worked and occasionally battled over the land throughout the century A settler from Michigan Schuyler Hain began promoting the beauty of Pinnacles around the turn of the century leading visitors on hikes up into talus caves in Bear Valley Word spread which led to the park s national monument designation In the the federal government hired hundreds of CCC Civilian Conservation Corps workers to further develop the monument they carved out many miles of the trails that still extend through the park today along with several buildings including Bear Gulch Nature Center and the stone restroom at Scout Peak In Pinnacles received a major status upgrade becoming the country s national park Although it lacks the singular thrills and sheer immensity of many of California s other national parks this acre park it s less than the size of Death Valley offers plenty of wonder and magnificent photo ops all of them contained within a manageable package that s at once secluded yet relatively easy to get to The park encompasses a cluster of craggy volcanoes flanked by scenic sparsely populated valleys and contains no park lodgings or restaurants but it s also within day tripping distance of Monterey Bay San Francisco and San Luis Obispo County If it s your first time visiting the park however consider spending the night somewhere relatively near the park such as King City Salinas or Hollister or overnighting in the park s picturesque campground Local options are neither fancy nor distinctive but this strategy will allow you to explore each side of the park at a leisurely pace What s remarkable about visiting Pinnacles from anywhere on the coast is the chance to experience such a strikingly different landscape within about miles of the ocean The park s soaring golden peaks and rocky spires and comparatively arid sunny climate look and feel a world away The signature attractions are the high peaks and the intriguing caves which are in the middle of the park and can be hiked to in a half day from either side However you approach Pinnacles you ll find opportunities to spy rare California condors flying overhead and to soak up a breathtaking landscape Sights Listings
