island for you depends on your plans such as hiking through Taveuni s waterfalls Don Mammoser Shutterstock With over islands making up this South Pacific dreamscape it would take a lifetime to truly explore every corner of Fiji Iâ ve been living in Fijiâ s capital city of Suva for several years and have made many travel mistakes and cultural snafus along the way Let me help you avoid the same pitfalls and ensure your trip to this wonderful nation goes smoothly From which island to choose to kava drinking etiquette and what to pack these are the dos and donâ ts of traveling to Fiji Get to know the islands before you arrive No two islands are exactly alike in Fiji and itâ s worth researching the main ones before you arrive Advertisement If youâ re limited on time and want to see some of the countryâ s best beaches spend your time island hopping around the Yasawa and Mamanuca island groups For waterfall laden hiking trails and technicolor coral reefs Taveuni awaits Viti Levu the main island is home to the capital city of Suva and hosts some of Fijiâ s best value resorts cultural activities hiking and the majority of the population To stay somewhere truly novel try Beqa which is famous for its firewalkers and has a strong cultural connection to the bull sharks that cruise around its surrounding reefs Vanua Levu Fijiâ s second largest island hosts the quaint town of Savusavu a hub for scuba diving freediving and laidback living If youâ re keen to splash out on a five star stay take your pick of private island resorts â accessible by private helicopter seaplane or boat â that offer an air of exclusivity not easily found elsewhere Some top recommendations include Kokomo Private Island Fiji Vomo Island Resort and Castaway Island Resort Stay at small resorts or homestays for a truly Fijian experience As a rule the larger the resort the less Fijian your trip may feel Most of the international chain resorts are found on Denarau Island a manmade island that makes up for its lackluster beach with plenty of pools bars and restaurants Smaller resorts and homestays tend to be decorated with locally made art offer guided trips to nearby villages and serve Fijian fare Once staff members knock off for the day theyâ re likely to invite you for a round or two of kava the traditional national drink of Fiji If you want an intimate stay Finding Islands Tours hosts immersive cultural trips on land and sea where youâ ll learn about traditional ways of life and interesting facts about Fiji Do your outdoor adventures when you arrive in case the weather causes delays EAGiven Getty Images Schedule your outdoor adventures sooner rather than later Life in the tropics means that no matter the weather forecast you could experience rain or bluebird skies or both on any given day Plan your hikes scuba dives snorkel tours sailing trips and other outdoor adventures towards the beginning of your stay That way youâ ll have time to reschedule should the weather interfere with your plans Come for at least a week â the longer the better If you plan to visit just one or two areas of Fiji a week is enough time to have a balance of sightseeing and relaxing If you hope to see more youâ ll lose at least half a day in transit whenever you island hop Thereâ s no way to see everything in one visit so itâ s best to slow down and pick just a few places to enjoy If youâ d prefer to do more rather than less take day trips from your accommodation rather than changing hotels every other day Advertisement Fijians love to embrace color in their everyday dress Alipate Laveti for Lonely Planet Follow the rainbow when it comes to packing Go ahead and pack the floral button up shirt or dress hiding in the back of your closet Fijians tend to dress in bright bold colors often covered with Pacific Island patterns or tropical prints A nice pair of sandals and a cheerful outfit will carry you from casual beach bars and the streets of Suva to fine dining venues If your outfit covers your shoulders and knees itâ s also suitable for village and church visits Buses and taxis are a budget friendly option on the main islands Save money traveling around Viti Levu by riding the bus The large buses servicing Nadi International Airport have space for luggage storage and are air conditioned Sunbeam and Pacific offer express services between Suva and Nadi Public buses tend to be even cheaper but stop frequently and lack air conditioning Taxis are metered and generally affordable but are only available on Fijiâ s larger islands Get ready to embrace the bula spirit Wherever you go you re likely to hear a hearty Bula from those around you Fijians are famous for their hospitality and are generally forgiving of etiquette blunders A few Fijian words will carry you through many social situations Bula means hello vinaka means thank you and moce pronounced mo they means see you later If you ask a Fijian a question and they raise their eyebrows you can assume the answer is yes The word set is usually used as okay If you hear someone blowing kisses in public it s likely not a catcall â Fijians use this sound to grab attention from a person they know If you re lucky enough to visit a local village it s good etiquette to bring a gift Alipate Laveti for Lonely Planet Donâ t enter a village empty handed Whenever you enter a village itâ s customary to bring a sevusevu gift Traditionally this gift is yaqona or kava a pepper root that is ground into a fine powder and drunk from a large wooden bowl called a tanoa Depending on the reason for your visit the village representative might invite you to drink kava with the community or simply grant you access to their land if youâ ve come to hike visit a waterfall or simply want to take a tour Avoid wearing anything on your head when you enter a village When dressing to enter a village both men and women are typically expected to wear a sulu sarong wrapped around their waists and a shirt that covers the shoulders Wearing anything on your head like sunglasses or a hat is considered impolite If youâ re bringing a backpack carry it like a purse in the nook of your arm rather than on your back Avoid lingering in doorways for too long once youâ ve been invited into a room If you re at all unsure about the etiquette during a kava ceremony just ask a local Alipate Laveti for Lonely Planet Donâ t be afraid to ask for tips on drinking kava If you are invited to drink kava in a village it will likely be with the head of the village and other members of the community and served in the community hall When you enter take off your shoes at the door and sit cross legged on the floor near your village representative who is usually someone assigned to host you for the experience Kava is poured from a large bowl and served in a coconut shell called a bilo It s customary to accept the first bilo of kava offered to you Every village is slightly different when it comes to how they drink kava some clap before drinking some say bula and clap after drinking and some receive the bilo with both hands instead of one When in doubt ask the Fijian you re sitting near It s okay to politely skip rounds and request low tide a half full coconut shell if you wish to pace yourself Not all tap water is drinkable The tap water is typically potable in Suva and most hotels provide filtered drinking water Elsewhere youâ ll need to bring your own bottled water or carry a filter such as a LifeStraw to drink from Even if you re not a rugby fan you will want to attend a local game while you re here Mark Kolbe Getty Images Rugby is the sport of choice Thereâ s no sport more beloved than rugby in Fiji After work and on weekends rugby pitches are abuzz with activity and making small talk about the sport is a surefire way to gain fast friends Even if you donâ t know the ins and outs of the game itâ s worth attending a match or pulling up a chair to watch it at a bar Take extra care in the cities after dark When it comes to safety in Fiji take the same precautions you would in any major city Stow your belongings out of sight and keep your wits about you Crime against tourists is low and typically involves theft Avoid going out drinking alone at night and take extra care around the bars near Nadi and Suva in the wee hours as this is where most muggings and assaults occur On the major islands of Fiji contact the police for emergencies and for police services if you need assistance On Fijiâ s outer islands there may not be an official police posting In this case itâ s best to seek help from your accommodation or the head of the village called the turaga ni koro Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address
