eBooks Download instantly and read any time Explore all products Travel Stories Puerto Rico Share The ultimate guide to getting around in Puerto Rico Anna Kaminski Dec min read Share Exploring the old town of San Juan on foot is a wonderful way to see the city Â Â Hola Images Getty Images Traffic congestion is a part of life in Puerto Rico where everyone and their grandmother owns a car and driving is the predominant mode of transportation This is largely due to the dearth of public transport on this large island outside of its urban hubs Driving is the most efficient way to see every stunning corner of this Caribbean beauty However it is possible to navigate the capital of San Juan by bus metro taxi and on foot For the rest of the island Here are the best ways to get around Puerto Rico depending on your budget and the length of your vacation Cycling on the road in Puerto Rico is an extreme sport To put it bluntly traveling around Puerto Rico on a bike is foolhardy at best and tantamount to a death wish at worst Advertisement Cyclists have to contend with multiple hazards from nightmare traffic and poor road conditions to dangerous drivers and a general lack of awareness about cyclists needs Don t even consider cycling after dark except in San Juan where there are designated bike lanes Recreational cycling is possible in San Juan where thereâ s a pleasant and safe cross city route along the shoreline from Old San Juan through Condado and Isla Verde as far as PiÃ ones the last part is on a designated bike lane Take your pick from a variety of well maintained bikes including mountain road electric hybrid and cruisers from San Juan Bike Rentals â they ll even deliver your wheels to your hotel Service may be erratic but buses are a cheap way to get around Puerto Rico Â Getty Images iStockphoto Explore San Juan on the bus or metro San Juan is the only city in Puerto Rico thatâ s served by an extensive network of clean air conditioned city buses However route maps and information can be hard to find and few bus stops indicate which buses stop where The service can be erratic with wait times between and minutes Ask around at bus stops where veteran riders can offer advice San Juan is also the only city in Puerto Rico with an inexpensive efficient metro Trains run every minutes daily between and connecting the popular neighborhood of Santurce with the university campus of RÃ o Piedras and shopping centers in Hato Rey and Torrimar with far flung Guaynabo and Driving is the only option in some parts of Puerto Rico Many of Puerto Ricoâ s roads are in poor shape especially after being battered by recent hurricanes Outside the well maintained expressway toll roads bumps potholes and broken guard rails are a fact of life along with erratic driving animals wandering out onto the road and more cars per square mile than any other place on earth Advertisement Despite all that having your own wheels is the most convenient way of getting around outside the capital â and downright essential if you want to roam the countryside visit national parks or explore the spectacular mile Ruta PanorÃ mica that runs along the mountainous spine of the island from to Cayey Renting a car in Puerto Rico Car rental rates in San Juan are very competitive elsewhere not so much A car costing US or less a day in San Juan will cost US or more in smaller cities and on nearby islands Check the conditions of your rental agreement as some companies prohibit taking rentals from the mainland to Culebra and Vieques All of the major international car rental companies operate on the island especially from the airport in San Juan There are also local firms particularly in smaller cities and on the islands Local tip If youâ re limiting your trip to San Juan a rental car is a liability the traffic is terrible and parking is scarce Use public transportation and taxis instead Parking is also a real problem in central Ponce Take the ferry to explore nearby islands Frequent daily ferry services serve the islands of Vieques and Culebra departing from Ceibaâ s ferry terminal a minute drive south of the port of Fajardo Up to date ferry schedules and tickets are available online arrive at the terminal at least an hour before the boat departs In January if youâ re lucky you can sometimes spot humpback whales from the ferry Services can be delayed or canceled altogether during hurricane season early June to late November There are no ferries between Vieques and Culebra Internal flights are limited and usually not worth it Daily domestic flights connect San Juanâ s Luis MuÃ oz MarÃ n airport with on the mainland s west coast and with the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques off the east coast However given it takes two hours to drive from San Juan to and an hour to drive from San Juan to Fajardo before taking a much cheaper ferry to Culebra or Vieques there is little reason to fly Exploring on foot isn t possible everywhere in Puerto Rico but a stroll along the promenade in San Juan is always a pleasure Â Getty Images iStockphoto Walking is a pleasure in the historic centers of San Juan and Ponce Old San Juan and the historical center of Ponce are wonderfully walkable and a pleasure to explore on foot The same cannot be said about the majority of Puerto Ricoâ s towns and cities with their often nonexistent sidewalks and cookie cutter urban sprawl PÃºblicos are the cheapest way to travel the island The cheapest way to get around Puerto Rico is by pÃºblicos â public minibuses that run prescribed routes during daylight hours either between places such as San Juan and Ponce or or short haul PÃºblicos are vans with the destination clearly written in the front window leaving once theyâ re full Some are busiest with commuters in the early morning and evening while others run to remote destinations and might leave you stranded due to their infrequency Taking a pÃºblico is a memorable local experience provided you donâ t mind being very hot and squeezed in with a million other passengers There s no central source of information about schedules or prices just turn up at a pÃºblico terminal or van stand near a smaller townâ s central plaza and ask around Taxis and Uber are readily available in larger cities Taxis are ubiquitous in San Juan and larger cities around the island Itâ s often quicker to walk out to a taxi rank or flag down a passing taxi than get through to one on the phone Meters are hardly ever used so always agree on the price before setting off The one exception is San Juan tourist taxis are regulated by the Puerto Rico Tourism Company and fixed rates are determined by the zone your destination falls into Uber is popular and covers San Juan much of the north coast including Arecibo and Fajardo as well as the eastern half of the island Caguas Fajardo and part of the south coast Guayama and around It doesnâ t cover Ponce Cabo Rojo or Within San Juan taxi lobbying groups have pushed for legislation that prohibits Uber from picking up or dropping passengers off at the airport or at certain hotels Accessible transportation in Puerto Rico is improving Travel is becoming easier for those with mobility issues thanks to the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA Public transportation services such as San Juanâ s public bus and metro plus taxis are now required by law to be wheelchair accessible On top of that there are wheelchair accessible shuttles from the airport while Equipos Pro Impedidos Caguas offers wheelchair accessible vehicle rentals Advertisement
