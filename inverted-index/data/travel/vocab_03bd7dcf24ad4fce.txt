How turtle watching tours actually help conservation Only one in a thousand leatherback turtles survive to sexual maturity and return to the place of their birth to lay their eggs like this nesting mother in Matura Trinidad Critical turtle conservation programs welcome travelers to get involved in Trinidad and Tobago Photograph by Mauricio Handler Nat Geo Image Collection TRAVEL PLANET POSSIBLE How turtle watching tours actually help conservation From data collection to caring for injured turtles get hands on in one of Earth s most important sea turtle conservation programs By Caroline Taylor June min read Sea turtles have been around since the time of the dinosaurs having survived multiple extinction events over million years But the cascading effects of human activity have caused rapid population decline and now six of the seven sea turtle species are considered threatened There are glimmers of hope through the dedicated work of conservationists and community based organizations around the world It s what has made Trinidad and Tobago a two island nation at the southern end of the Caribbean archipelago one of the most important leatherback rookeries in the Western Hemisphere and the second largest after Gabon Five of the seven sea turtle species can be found in Trinidad and Tobago s waters Here the west coast of Tobago embraces the Caribbean Sea Photograph by Michael Melford Nat Geo Image Collection Each season the islands conservation teams depend on visitors to help give these creatures a fighting chance against the multitude of threats to their survival including habitat destruction climate change induced reproductive issues and bycatch offshore The turtle watching tours they run provide vital revenue to fund monitoring and patrols and volunteers including travelers from overseas power that work in the field It s literally our passion nobody gets into this to make money says Giancarlo Lalsingh who s spent years in local conservation including over a decade at Save Our Sea Turtles SOS Tobago It s really tough But the outcome of all that work is so worth it Zoom in to see more locations mentioned in the story Regardless of ability or experience there s a way for everyone to aid new generations of sea turtles survive against the odds Here s what you need to know about the threats these animals are facing and how you can get involved to help A six decade success story Trinidad and Tobago is perhaps best known for steel drums calypso limbo and Caribbean style carnival But in the quiet of forests and beaches a different kind of enchantment awaits At night during nesting season sometimes but very rarely in daylight turtles begin to emerge from the sea Large leatherbacks stun onlookers they can grow to pounds and feet in length Nesting mothers heave themselves onto land first carving out their nests then laying to a hundred eggs before laboriously camouflaging the clutches in sand before slowly making their way back to the sea What a fossilized egg on a prehistoric turtle revealed inside Nesting mothers will make multiple visits to the beach over the season up to for leatherbacks and five for hawksbills Roughly two months later little hatchlings burrow their way out of the sand and dash for the open ocean Fewer than one in a thousand will make it to sexual maturity to years later Those females that do will make the long trek back to the beaches on which they were born to birth another generation A nesting mother lays a clutch of eggs on Matura Beach on Trinidad s northeast coast Photograph by

turtle species visit Trinidad and Tobago s waters leatherbacks hawksbills greens loggerheads and olive ridleys The first three nest across both islands primarily on Trinidad s north and east coasts and in smaller numbers around Tobago through nesting season March to August for leatherbacks and May to November for hawksbills During nesting months more than turtles and as many as will lay on the islands beaches The greatest concentration of them will be at Grande Riviere a beach less than a mile long in a remote village on Trinidad s north coast and the densest leatherback nesting ground in the world On a busy night in the peak months May and June up to turtles can nest on this beach alone and up to at Matura a larger beach on the rural northeast coast The number of leatherbacks nesting there it s almost like a mass nesting event says Vanessa Bezy a National Geographic Explorer marine biologist and wildlife conservationist from the U S who is working to protect sea turtles in Costa Rica Where I am leatherbacks are critically endangered I think there s only a couple hundred left in this part of the Pacific Volunteers are responsible for making Trinidad and Tobago s humble turtle conservation a success story on a global scale They spend untold hours tagging counting and measuring nesting mothers monitoring and sometimes even relocating nests and helping safeguard the turtles from predators and threats Their hard work has caused leatherback meat and egg poaching to fall to near zero Volunteers help hatchlings find their way to the open water Without the aid the young turtles can become disoriented by artificial light sources and fall prey to predators including dogs and raccoons Photograph by Brian Skerry Nat Geo Image Collection Pigeon Point Heritage Park on Tobago protects the habitats of coral communities mangrove forests hawksbill turtles and more than a hundred species of fish Photograph by Michael Melford Nat Geo Image Collection That work began in through a collaboration between the University of the West Indies and the Trinidad and Tobago Field Naturalists Club In the nation s Forestry Division developed a co management partnership with the rural communities where turtles nest fostering the growth of several community based organizations that would power the conservation effort in the decades that followed Twenty eight of them now comprise the Turtle Village Trust This distinctive community led approach particularly in Matura and Grande Riviere has become a model for similar conservation initiatives across the Caribbean and earned the organizations local and international awards for their work While there s been a percent drop in leatherback populations in nearby French Guiana and a percent in the Eastern Pacific Trinidad and Tobago saw local populations rebound significantly in the and have gradually declined since These efforts have been bolstered by the country outlawing turtle hunting in and declaring sea turtle species as environmentally sensitive in Powered by people There is still much work to be done Only a fraction of nesting beaches is actively monitored leaving a data gap not just with the leatherback but the smaller hawksbill and green turtles which are the main target of poaching and harvesting for their meat and shells How nearly sea turtles were saved from freezing waters in Texas Chronic funding shortfalls equipment and worker shortages mean that especially on high traffic nesting beaches some turtles return to the ocean without being tagged or recorded There is even less coverage for offshore monitoring All the data is key to helping researchers and public policy officials understand turtles migration routes when where and how often they nest how successful their nests are and key population trends It helps shape local regional and international policy Nesting is just one part of the life cycle explains Tomas Diagne a Senegalese biologist and National Geographic Explorer who works in turtle conservation across Africa Sea turtles need to travel and reach their nesting ground he says and this directs the work he does in trying to limit the bycatch offshore It s the most pressing global issue for sea turtles along with other drivers of population decline plastic pollution coastal development and the effects of the climate crisis from habitat

start a swimming frenzy to get away from shore where predation is high Photograph by Brian Skerry Nat Geo Image Collection One of the easiest ways people can help is through an app called TURT a project of SOS Tobago and SpeSeas where users can report sea turtle sightings on land or at sea Michelle Cazabon Mannette one of SpeSeas directors along with National Geographic Explorer Diva Amon of Trinidad says divers are one of the key groups they are targeting with the app to help with offshore monitoring How artificial intelligence is helping fight against illegal wildlife trade But most of the islands data is collected during nesting and entered into organizational and national databases Much of it is funded by turtle watching tours which are an accessible way to experience the turtles up close Local and international volunteers meanwhile are the backbone of the monitoring work Nature Seekers welcomes the greatest number of volunteers from overseas While they and other organizations welcome operational support for things such as data entry and marketing the greatest need is in the field which can be grueling You re going out there at night you re walking long distances you re exposed to the elements to mosquitoes and sand flies and rain says Lalsingh It s really difficult physically taxing work Assignments may vary based on experience levels of commitment and physical fitness But after training field volunteers will almost invariably begin making sure nesting mothers can access the beach and nest successfully gathering data about the ones that do and looking out for injured or sick turtles Some turtles arrive injured or impeded in some way with ropes or fishing gear wrapped around them flippers damaged or missing or with other war wounds from their lives at sea one had been impaled by a spear from a billfish Volunteers then need to work quickly to render some emergency first aid whether it s disentangling cleaning wounds or helping dig nests Volunteers wait for the mother to enter the critical trance state when she is consumed by the laying process and becomes minimally aware and reactive to activity around her Then volunteers get to work measuring scanning tags on returning turtles sometimes replacing or upgrading them or applying tags on new ones Making contact at any other time could compromise the entire nesting process Nests continue to be monitored all season and volunteers work to ensure as many babies make it safely to the sea as possible When there are hatchlings who can t quite dig out of the nest on their own volunteers will do a nest excavation give the hatchlings some extra care and then release them into the sea And as some turtles choose inhospitable spots for nests beach erosion is a major threat volunteers may carefully relocate the nest sometimes to an artificial hatchery After years I m still in awe of this gentle magnificent creature says Suzan Lakhan Baptiste Managing Director of Nature Seekers I would want the world to experience it to engage those who want to really make a difference How you can help For those short on time The easiest way to help turtle conservation efforts is to go turtle watching which helps fund monitoring and patrols Nature Seekers and the Grande Riviere Nature Tour Guides Association run tours on the largest nesting beaches The Las Cuevas Eco Friendly Association and partners of SOS Tobago also operate tours in their communities You can also make donations to support their work Spend several days On shorter trips volunteers might help with field work like keeping nesting areas free of debris scanning and tagging nesting turtles and data collection like size number and location of turtles and nests International volunteers can sign up through organizations like the Oceanic Society and Canadian Sea Turtle Network Spend several weeks Local organizations recommend staying at least two to four weeks to get the best training and have the most meaningful impact Some volunteers stay for several months and return year after year The most skilled and experienced may get involved with even more hands on activities like helping care for injured turtles mothers or hatchlings and excavating or relocating nests Caroline Taylor is a writer based in Trinidad and Tobago You can find her on Twitter Related Topics SEA TURTLES HAWKSBILL SEA TURTLES LOGGERHEAD SEA
