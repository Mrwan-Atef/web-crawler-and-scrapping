read Share Visitors watch Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park Kit Leong Shutterstock The United States feels larger than life from its sprawling big cities to its epic natural splendors And its citizens When it comes to friendliness and national pride we can be a little â extra â too Itâ s true that our politics these days can be divisive But even in a time of radical change youâ ll find that political views donâ t enter into small talk or day to day interactions If youâ re planning a trip to the USA weâ ve provided a few pointers to help you navigate planning etiquette and health and safety issues during your visit Foreign visitors might need a visa â and will definitely need an ESTA Visitors from more than countries can travel to the USA without a visa thanks to the Visa Waiver Program Yet even so theyâ ll need to register and pay ahead of their trip via the Electronic System for Travel Authorization ESTA If you are traveling to the US by plane or boat ESTA must be secured prior to boarding Travelers from other countries will need to secure a visa in order to enter the USA Hereâ s a full guide to the ins and outs of the process Advertisement Driving through the North Cascades Range in the Pacific Northwest Edmund Lowe Photography Getty Images Pick just one region of the USA to explore With its states national parks and million miles of highways how in the world to you begin planning a trip to the USA And how will you get around We suggest taking a deep dive into one of the countryâ s rich regions Stretching miles from coast to coast the continental USA breaks down loosely broken into several distinct and discrete chunks New England the Mid Atlantic the South the Midwest the Southwest and the West This last vast region can be further sorted into the Rocky Mountains the Pacific Northwest and California And beyond the Lower youâ ve got the extremes of Alaska and Hawaii Seemingly refusing to join a category is Texas which is diverse enough â or maybe stubborn enough â to defy regional stereotypes Once you have your region count on spending a week there at least Exploring a major metropolitan area like New York City Chicago Los Angeles or Washington DC could easily fill a week especially if you include day trips to outlying parks and beaches You may be able to cover a small state like Vermont or West Virginia in a week as well To really dig into a region however youâ ll want at least days especially if youâ re flying in from overseas With a week and a half you can visit two or more cities and a handful of outlying attractions Thatâ s also enough time to explore a couple of national parks in one region particularly in California or the Southwest Donâ t overplan your days It is tempting to look at a map calculate your mileage and assume you can make four or five different stops in a day Yet with unexpected delays and detours a constant you should realize that what youâ ve planned on an app will probably not match real life Two lane roads are common in and around national parks and Winnebagos wildlife and gorgeous scenery will slow you down Smaller roads are also the norm in mountains and rural areas and passing slowpokes can be stressful Chances are youâ ll want to linger at one of or your preplanned stops â so be sure to leave room for serendipity in your itinerary Hiking Angels Landing in Zion National Park which requires an advance reservation Jordan Siemens Getty Images Sometimes getting outdoors requires a reservation Do you have to prebook your hike Unfortunately the answer is sometimes yes Thanks to enormous jumps in visitation several national parks now require reservations to hike their most popular trails You need a reservation to hike Half Dome in Yosemite Angels Landing in Zion and Old Rag Mountain in Shenandoah Some national parks require reservations for park entry or popular activities You need a reservation to drive to the summit of Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park for example Arches National Park and Rocky Mountain National Park require reservations for entry during their busy seasons You need a permit to watch the sunset at HaleakalÄ National Park on Maui and the glorious Yosemite Firefall Yosemite and Glacier have run pilot reservation programs â for overall entry into Yosemite and for travel in certain regions in Glacier Check park websites for the latest details well before sometimes up to a year before your trip Museums might require an advance ticket too Itâ s not just national parks that get crowded Temporary exhibits at large urban museums can be extremely popular and many have timed entry slots which are secured by reservations Small niche museums in busy tourist areas may also require prebooking Tickets for the Georgia Oâ Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe for example can sell out daily Advertisement Cavern tours often fill up a day or two in advance Check the reservation system on the website to be safe especially in summer when families are traveling Pack layers for hikes If hiking is in your USA plans and it should be pack layers even in summer â since high elevation deserts and most mountains even those in the South see cooler temperatures at night Most hikers pack three layers a base layer next to the skin an insulating layer and an outer shell layer for protection from wind and rain Running shoes are fine for easy trails but wear hiking boots that youâ ve broken in for anything more strenuous If youâ re not backpacking low ankle hiking boots should be fine We also recommend hiking with sun protection hat and sunscreen and a daypack for storing food water and a small first aid kit Mondays can be slow Many restaurants and small museums are closed on Monday some are also closed on Tuesdays especially in small towns Closures can be even more frequent in remote tourist towns with restaurants and attractions not opening until midweek If you want to dine and explore to the fullest in say Bisbee Arizona or Marfa Texas plan to visit Thursday through Sunday Lobstermen in Portland Maine A friendly smile goes a long way in the USA spwidoff Shutterstock Use friendly greetings and be on time Donâ t be overly physical when meeting or greeting someone in the USA While some Americans may hug and urbanites may exchange cheek kisses most â especially men â shake hands Itâ s also standard to greet the staff when entering and leaving a shop â helloâ and â have a nice dayâ are commonplace Americans tend to smile a lot which is typically an easy expression of welcome or politeness And if youâ re meeting someone be on time Many folks in the US consider it rude to be kept waiting Expect small talk but donâ t delve into politics really Americans can be a chatty lot especially in small towns Exchanging pleasantries about the weather or your immediate surroundings is typical but donâ t be surprised if someone eventually asks â What do you do â â which typically means â Whatâ s your job â Such a request may come off as nosy to visitors from abroad but itâ s usually not meant that way Feel free to share as much or as little as you wish Political conversations can get dicey quickly especially in todayâ s polarized environment so we recommend keeping political opinions to yourself this is especially relevant for foreigners Donâ t assume you know someoneâ s political views based on where you find yourself or how someone talks or dresses On occasion someone may toss out a live wire topic just to get a reaction or show off In that case itâ s best to smile or change the topic Discretion is the better part of a future bar fight Two women at New York Cityâ s Pride March Getty Images Donâ t stress about what to wear In the US just about anything goes in terms of personal presentation and youâ ll rarely feel uncomfortable because of what youâ re wearing That said itâ s worth bringing along dressier attire smart casual for dining at nice restaurants or for upscale bars and clubs Public restrooms arenâ t always easy to find It can be surprisingly challenging to track down public restrooms in the USA In dense urban areas your best bets are visitor centers libraries indoor malls and larger city parks You may have to buy a coffee or snack to get the restroom key in coffee shops in heavily trafficked neighborhoods In the suburbs try larger gas stations and fast food restaurants Along interstate limited access highways youâ ll typically find pullover areas with restrooms picnic tables and space for dog walking about every miles or so The best option for those with small bladders When you see a restroom use it The terrace at CafÃ du Monde New Orleans Andriy Blokhin Shutterstock Be prepared to tip With coffee shops casual restaurants and even some retailers now offering a tipping option on transactions especially for touch screen ones tipping protocols in the US have gotten increasingly confusing In sit down restaurants and at bars tipping is not optional as tips are part of serversâ core wages rather than â extras â Therefore you should withhold a tip only when service is outrageously bad Even then a small tip and a chat with the manager may be best What about coffee shops If you serve yourself tipping is discretionary We recommend leaving your change and a dollar is always appreciated For more complicated coffee orders consider a tip of to A tip is the norm for restaurant servers unless the gratuity is already included in the bill as is the case for larger parties or at select restaurants where tips are baked into listed prices For bartenders itâ s to per round or a minimum of per drink For airport and hotel porters the norm is per bag or a minimum of per cart Pay a valet at least upon the return of your keys For taxi drivers itâ s to rounded up to the next dollar Leave a few dollars under the pillow for hotel housekeepers daily It is not a norm to tip on purchases at wine shops convenience stores or other retail outlets Smoking is generally socially unacceptable Donâ t assume you can smoke even if youâ re outside Most people in the US have little tolerance for smokers and smoking has even been banned from many outdoor areas such as parks boardwalks and beaches Women from Zuni Pueblo wearing traditional ceremonial attire Santa Fe Shizuko Alexander Getty Images Check the rules before you visit Native American reservations and pueblos When visiting a reservation or pueblo ask about and follow any specific rules for outsiders Almost all tribes ban alcohol and some do not allow pets and restrict cameras All require permits for camping fishing and other activities If rules are not posted at the entrance check the reservation website When you visit a reservation youâ ll be experiencing a unique culture with customs that may be unfamiliar to you Always be courteous respectful and open minded Donâ t expect locals to share every detail of their lives Purchase travel insurance Health care costs in the USA are extremely high All travelers are advised to carry a health insurance policy that covers medical visits in the case of something unexpected during your trip to the USA Without insurance you may be billed the full cost of any care you receive which can easily run into the thousands of dollars especially for emergency room visits And any American can tell you that dealing with US insurance companies is far from a treat An Revolutionary War re enactor at Carlyle House Alexandria Virginia Richard T Nowitz Getty Images The USAâ s gun culture is unique in the world The right to bear arms is enshrined in the United States Constitution â and throughout the countryâ s history its citizens have not taken this right for granted To put it mildly While policies related to firearms vary from state to state and even city to city there are few restrictions on gun ownership in the USA compared to other countries Donâ t be shocked to see people bearing pistols in holsters in public especially in more rural areas While gun violence looms large in the public consciousness and mass shootings occur far too frequently the risk of any one individual experiencing such an incident is exceedingly low Which means bad thoughts of firearms shouldnâ t preoccupy you during your time in the USA Follow common sense safety tips For most visitors to the US petty theft is a bigger concern than violent crime To avoid the admittedly remote risk of robbery take common sense steps like withdrawing money from ATMs during the day or in well lit busy areas at night When loading or unloading your car keep an eye on all your bags especially if crowds are around Lock valuables in the trunk of your car and put them there before you hit the road for the day Unfortunately itâ s becoming more common for thieves to smash car windows and snatch items left in view Read our trip planning articles for San Francisco Seattle New York City and other major urban areas for city specific tips on crime
