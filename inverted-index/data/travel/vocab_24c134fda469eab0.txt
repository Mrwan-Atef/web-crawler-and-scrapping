capital by night the best bars and clubs in Delhi Puneetinder Kaur Sidhu Aug min read Share Whether Delhi trumps Mumbai as party capital of India or vice versa is a topic of endless debate defended heatedly by Delhites and Mumbaikars alike But whoever tops the stakes Delhi has a well deserved reputation for its boisterous nightlife and frenetic party scene â discotheques in premier hotels chic stand alone bars neighbourhood watering holes themed lounges you name it Here are our picks of Delhiâ s best bars clubs discos and late night hangouts where night owls come to sip on classic cocktails guzzle pints shake a leg or indulge in a little bit of nostalgia It s worth noting most spots in Delhi are done by so if you re used to a longer session start early â or pick your venue carefully For the love of music at Summer House CafÃ Spread across three floors in a leafy Hauz Khas nook Summer House CafÃ is an easygoing escape and a huge hit with those devoted to live music The enviable gig roster ensures weekends are jam packed with regulars calling ahead for a reservation is a good way to avoid disappointment and an interminable wait Drinkers seeking a breather from the din and DJ conducted dancing can head to the terrace and trippy rooftop where giant bottles flank an al fresco bar counter masquerading as a camper van Advertisement Opening hours midday to Old fashioned cocktails attract a sophisticated crowd at Rick s Â Taj Mahal Hotel Delhi Retro chic at Rickâ s Frequented by Delhiâ s forty somethings this stylish bar at the Taj Mahal Hotel was once the toast of the town and while things have calmed down a tad it continues to ooze nostalgia Styled like a film set from the complete with disco hits of the period wafting in the background Rickâ s old school demeanour has stood the test of time Saturdays are earmarked for live gigs attracting a swish crowd who love to sip on an Old Fashioned or a Message in a Bottle gin and ginger ale An excellent selection of wines and single malts keep purists in high spirits compensating for the slightly less exciting nosh that comes as finger food Opening hours to Sufi soul and sangria at S Bar S Bar Restaurant aka Shalom in N Block Market Greater Kailash I is the quintessential friendly neighbourhood lounge the sort of place where youâ re likely to bump into familiar faces each time you visit An air of congenial sophistication radiates and the vastly popular Sufi nights on Wednesdays and Fridays featuring atmospheric Sufi tunes have been drawing a steady stream of loyal patrons for years Spread across three levels the bar has a Middle Eastern look feel and flavour Most nights pitchers of sangria and margarita fly thick and fast â as do the mezze platters â while a soundtrack of old and new lounge hits thumps in the background Advertisement Opening hours midday to Sup European lager at Chatter House Nothing says â pubâ quite like old world interiors vintage posters of British bands buckets of beer and foosball tables Youâ ll find a convincing facsimile of a European boozer at both branches of Chatter House in Khan Market and Nehru Place Come Thursday the Nehru Place branch hosts karaoke nights for the unabashed Keeping the Witlingers Desperadoes and Affligem Blondes company is a spiffy list of real ales and ciders that keeps Delhi drinkers happy late into the night year round For a place focused on hops and grains the nosh here is surprisingly good with onion rings blue cheese naans and lamb galouti sliders being our top picks Opening hours midday to Of beans berries and grapes at Perch Since Delhiâ s first wine and coffee bar opened for business the city s vino enthusiasts and java connoisseurs have never had it so good An unpretentious and informal ambience keeps Perch packed through the day and busy late into the evening Think white walls sturdy wood furniture wine racks and hanging greenery accompanied by a soundtrack of easy listening and jazz greats There are two branches now one in Khan Market and another in Vasant Vihar Live performances at weekends turn the place into a bustling cultural melting pot as locals gather over wine glasses and coffee mugs Vintage and new world wines are prominent on the menu and drinks are available by the glass bottle and pitcher The signature Coffee Sangria â a heady mix of coffee wine and vodka is available for those who like their libations by the litre Opening hours to Dance until dawn at Privee If you want to go late in Delhi you ll almost always need to head to a club housed in one of the city s luxury hotels There s a few to choose from and in all honesty not always that much to tell them apart but if you re after thumping music and a dance floor that ll stay packed until dawn Privee is a good bet It s unashamedly upmarket â housed in the Shangri La s Eros Hotel â choosy with its clientele dress smart and certainly pricey but the music usually electronic interspersed with chart hits is loud and its central location near Connaught Place makes access easy Performances by famous name DJs up the buzz factor on a regular basis Matching the energy is a top notch bar brimming with premium brands Generous pourings of which help distract from the less than superlative service Opening hours to Other notable nightlife haunts Piano Man Jazz Club â a dim lit speakeasy with live jazz performances Unplugged â a laid back bar with giant courtyard garden in the heart of CP â the lobby bar at the glitzy Lalit Hotel is always open Toy Room â alternative to Privee though less central in Aloft Hotel There s often a man on the dance floor dressed as a bear Open until on weekends Still not satisfied See our full list of bars pubs and clubs in Delhi https shop lonelyplanet com products
