read Share Planes de Renderos in El Salvador Â Luis Siguenza Lonely Planet Rejuvenated and forward looking this stunningly beautiful Central American country has momentum building that landed it a spot in our Learn category El Salvador s idyllic beaches are catching the attention of professional surfers from around the world as it works hard to establish itself as Surf City The country is quietly becoming the place where those in the know come to catch waves and hone their surfing skills There s so much to learn about this country Lonely Planet guidebook author Paige R Penland plans out your four day getaway to its coastal waters quaint towns and volcanoes Advertisement Iâ ve visited El Salvador a dozen times since when I was lead author on Lonely Planet Nicaragua El Salvador Iâ ll be taking my year old son on the next trip to visit Isla de los PÃ jaros and the epic waterparks for which this country should be better known Search for Apuzunga Turicentro Atecozol and Canopys del Rio Sunzal to see what I mean Why I think you should visit El Salvador El Salvador offers almost everything travelers to Latin America are looking for just three hours by plane from Miami sunny beaches quaint colonial towns stunning volcanoes colorful handicrafts low prices and arguably the finest cuisine in Central America It is compact with dramatic topography and excellent main roads You could literally surf La Libertad all morning relax over lunch in Spanish Colonial Suchitoto and watch sunset from a chilly at Hostal Miramundo â and only spend about four hours total in the car All of this makes El Salvador an easy escape for North Americans on a long weekend If time is no object however two to four weeks would be ideal Budget travelers can enjoy El Salvador on per day and much less if you plan carefully Mid range travelers will be comfortable on per day not including rental car Luxury lovers will find a small selection of excellent resorts and restaurants for about half what theyâ d pay in more popular Latin American destinations Travelers may read the international criticism of El Salvadorâ s current government and worry that their money is supporting it There is some truth to that On balance however I think tourism favors the little guy â Jack Ma taught himself English as a tour guide after all Think before you spend and try to support local businesses with El Salvadorâ s best interests at heart El Salvadorâ s official currency has been the US dollar since another convenience for US travelers In President Bukele made Bitcoin El Salvadorâ s second official currency and itâ s widely accepted through smartphone apps That decision was controversial to say the least â yet tourism has since grown an astonishing I appreciate the Bitcoin bump because not every article about El Salvador begins with â war tornâ anymore Itâ s not This is a small country with big dreams still willing to believe in the future And thatâ s the real reason why you should come Start with a perfect day in the capital This itinerary assumes travelers have rented a car day If you use public transportation double travel times or check online bus schedules Our journey begins at Romero International Airport â or if youâ ve already been relaxing with the sun and surf along El Salvadorâ s coastline minutes away in La Libertad Whether youâ ve been here all week or just arrived weâ re headed up to the capital San Salvador â Pupusas for breakfast Pull off the highway in Olocuilta where a tidy strip of pupuserÃ as serve up stacks of the cityâ s signature rice pupusas more delicate and refined than the more widely available corn masa versions of El Salvadorâ s cheap filling national dish If youâ re looking for a more elegant brunch enjoy gourmet tamales omelets and tost secreto Salvadoran style avocado toast at Tu JardÃ n Secreto The relaxing garden setting is in Planes de Renderos a popular escape from the city with parks horseback rides and the family friendly minute hike up Puerta del Diablo a startling rock formation with views to the Pacific Ocean from the top Advertisement â Arrive in Colonia Our base in the capital is posh Colonia with upscale shopping dining and accommodation options After coffee at Tipicos Margoth catch a cab to the Museum of Anthropology for an overview of El Salvadorâ s history including pre Columbian relics Spanish Colonial art and exhibits that explore modern challenges from the civil war to gang violence and mass emigration From there itâ s a short walk to the National Craft Market where artisans sell quality handicrafts from around the country including comfortable hand woven hammocks clever ceramic dioramas from Ilobasco and the colorful naive folk art of La Palma â which youâ ll see firsthand tomorrow â Head to Centro Historico Take a taxi to the Centro Historico home to the National Palace National Theater and Metropolitan Cathedral the final resting place of St Oscar Romero As you explore the city centerâ s parks plazas and markets donâ t miss the somber Monument of Memory and Truth in Parque CuscatlÃ n engraved with the names of those lost during El Salvadorâ s civil war and be sure to step inside Iglesia El Rosario to see the symphony of rainbows its windows play upon the sculptural interior â Check out VolcÃ n San Salvador Grab a cab to the top of VolcÃ n San Salvador minutes and watch the sunset and city lights over exquisite grilled meats and seafood served with sweet potato biscuits at Las Brumas â Enjoy San Salvador s nightlife Thereâ s time for a disco nap before the countryâ s best nightlife begins Look forward to an ever changing assortment of clubs and bars enjoy laid back city views at The Rooftop dinner and live music at Republik and all night dance parties at AliVE A perfect day in the Central Highlands â Arrive at Suchitotoâ s tiny Puerto San Juan a cheerful cluster of souvenir stores restaurants and a dock overlooking Lake SuchitlÃ n just minutes from the capital Boats offer one hour tours around the islands including Isla de Los PÃ jaros â Bird Islandâ its trees shrieking and singing with the voices of some species of mostly migratory birds jabiru storks seagulls cormorants pelicans and many more Noon â Lunch at Villa Balanza After lunch at artsy Villa Balanza itâ s time to check in at the meticulously restored year old mansion that is now one of El Salvadorâ s most luxurious properties Los Almendros de San Lorenzo The courtyards are hung with marvelous art and Moorish details and filled with gardens and a sparkling pool an architectural gem even by Suchitotoâ s high standards â Stroll through the city Just strolling the cobbled streets of this breezy Spanish Colonial city is a delight The rich blue textiles fluttering from the doors are dyed with indigo grown here since Pipil Mayans ran the place Arte AÃ il across from picturesque Iglesia Santa Lucia offers classes minutes per group where you can try your hand at this ancient art â Mayan influenced art in La Palma An hour north of Suchitoto is La Palma birthplace of the vibrant Mayan influenced naive art that has become synonymous with El Salvador itself It was pioneered by artist Fernando Llort in the to help local artisans thrive today you can visit workshops covered with murals and watch artists create the vibrant pieces from wood glass and other materials After Llortâ s most famous piece on San Salvadorâ s Metropolitan Cathedral was destroyed in artists recreated it using digital mapping and projected it onto the facade â Back to Los Almendros for Dinner Although Suchitoto has several excellent restaurants weâ ll return to Los Almendros for dinner where chefs use Salvadoran ingredients and French techniques to create award winning recipes Try the mariscada a traditional Salvadoran seafood stew with lobster and cream the dijon chicken baguette or the vegetarian lasagna If youâ re game Suchitotoâ s nightlife scene is small but always festive Pyramids and Volcanoes After a leisurely breakfast at CafÃ itâ s an hour to Joya de CerÃ n also called Central Americaâ s Pompeii While youâ ve probably seen the massive stone pyramids and ballcourts of the Classical Mayan capitals if not the ruins of CopÃ n are hours north of Suchitoto the modest lives of Mayan villagers are mostly lost to time Except here Preserved since beneath of volcanic ash small lovingly decorated adobe homes a temezcal sweat lodge and the oldest cultivated yuca manioc make this one of Central Americaâ s most important archaeological sites Fifteen minutes away San AndrÃ s was the regional Mayan administrative center with small stone pyramids and the remains of a Spanish Colonial indigo processing facility â Volcanoes in Cerro Verde National Park Itâ s another hour to Cerro Verde National Park with three magnificent volcanoes and several hikes including an easy half mile loop with unforgettable views Athletic travelers can arrange steep three to six hour guided hikes to the top of either Izalco Volcanoâ s barren steaming cinder cone or to Santa Anaâ s nested calderas and scenic lakes These hikes leave at and must be done with a guide which might mean shifting your itinerary â Stay overnight at Lago Coatepeque There are great places to stay in the park but weâ re headed to the enormous sq miles sq km sparkling crater lake you were admiring on your hike Lago Coatepeque Itâ s another impossibly scenic hour in the car to the lakeshore which is lined with hotels restaurants and bars most with swimming docks Lodging along the lakefront runs from to per night so youâ ll have a pick for your budget Dinner at La Octava Maravilla costs about â and itâ s mandatory Iâ ll be having the mojarra rellena a whole fried fish stuffed with shrimp and other shellfish After dinner order an ice cold beer at one of the lakefront bars The party can go all night Stop and smell the flowers in El Salvador After breakfast on the lake itâ s another hour to Entre RÃ os Ecopark outside the town of Izalco Slip into one of the natural hot and cold pools to relax or try the water slides When youâ re ready order brunch right to your hammock â Visit Ruta las Flores Ruta las Flores is El Salvadorâ s most popular inland attraction a strand of lovely little towns and accessible natural wonders in the coffee growing highlands between Sonsonate and the Guatemalan border If itâ s Saturday weâ ll stop at JuayÃºaâ s famed Gastronomic Festival which runs every weekend with stands selling styrofoam plates piled grilled meats spiced prawns and tasty rice dishes and
