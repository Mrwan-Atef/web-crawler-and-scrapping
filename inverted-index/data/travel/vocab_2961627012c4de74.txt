Following in the footsteps of elephants through eastern Sri Lanka TRAVEL Following in the footsteps of elephants on a journey through wild eastern Sri Lanka Heading south east from the tea plantations of Sri Lanka s highlands vast tracts of jungle flow towards the beach through less visited national parks like Gal Oya Travellers can view the wilderness from a train take a tuk tuk safari or hike in the footsteps of elephants with the indigenous Vedda people Celebrating its anniversary this year the Kandy to Ella railway line is famed for being one of the most scenic train journeys in the world Photograph by Simon Urwin By Lorna Parkes Photographs by Simon Urwin August This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK We move as a tight knit herd It s like a sauna in here whispers my guide Kapi mopping his brow and wafting air up his white polo shirt A baby s foot digs into my ribs as we lurch forward carried by a sea of people trying to get closer to a casket so luminously golden it looks like it s glowing Tray after tray of perfumed white jasmine gardenia and lotus flowers are held aloft and pushed forward by human chains of devotees All this for a tooth but not just any tooth The casket holds a rare relic of the Buddha said to have been smuggled out of southern India in the locks of a princess s hair in the century CE It eventually found its way here to the highland kingdom of Kandy in central Sri Lanka Kandy fell to the British in during colonial rule but reverence for the Temple of the Sacred Tooth that houses the casket continued to grow Three times a day hundreds of pilgrims and curious travellers now come for this pooja ceremony when the doors to the shrine are opened played out to booming thammattama drums and shrill horanawa clarinets It s one of the world s holiest Buddhist sites and a baptism of fire for my trip into the east of Sri Lanka One of the world s holiest Buddhist sites the Temple of Tooth s pooja ceremony is visited by hundreds of pilgrims and travellers every day Photograph by Simon Urwin For all the symbols of gilded devotion it s the temple s volume of ivory some fake some real that stays with me Dozens of tusks protect the shrine complex like a rib cage around a precious beating heart The British came to Sri Lanka not just for spices but for ivories says Koralagamage Lalith Kapila Chandraratne known as Kapi after the ceremony At the time the whole of Sri Lanka was covered in elephants The British came to the highlands hunted the elephants and cleared the thick forests to plant tea I see the tea bushes for myself the next day taking my place by the open window aboard a train that climbs steadily above Kandy s heat haze with the deafening roar of a tiger An hour or so out of town sarong clad pickers hoist hessian sacks and farm workers stop to stare as we pass After Sri Lankan independence in the tea plantations remained as a legacy of colonialism Liptons is just one of the major names still present in these hills I m on another remnant the famed Kandy to Ella railway line originally built by the British to transport tea from the highlands for export It s now lauded as one of the most scenic train rides in the world and celebrates its anniversary this year We are swallowed up and spat out by the landscape careering through wide ravines watered by cascades and squeezing into dark tunnels that burrow under palm tipped mountains Tiny settlements and brightly painted stations flash by like rapidly changing TV channels A perfect wall of ebony black ivory tusked elephant statuettes appears out of nowhere beside the tracks guarding a temple As passengers talk in hushed tones hawkers navigate seating booths and doorways selling chilli mango and peanuts fried with curry leaves A child waves at us from a river as we pass above him on a metal bridge then dives under the caramel coloured water like a fish Photographs by Simon Urwin Taking it all in are Stanley Dissanayake and Karuna Tilaka a pair of Railway Protection Force officers with wrinkled eyes and starched tamarind brown uniforms They take empty window seats their gazes routinely drawn to the scenery as much as mine Stanley tells me they ve both been working for the railway since and he will soon retire From my deepest heart I love it he says No other country is like Sri Lanka Everywhere you look is green green green Rice country Stanley s affection is infectious Getting off the train at tiny Haputale station five stops before the busy hill town of Ella it isn t long before I find myself sat by a swimming pool with sun loungers under a pagoda in Wellawaya admiring a startlingly green panorama Some of Sri Lanka s land is devoted to rice cultivation and the view in front of me is an almost neon blanket of rice paddies I m staying at an agrotourism hotel called Kaduruketha and as well as hosting bungalows its lands are a working rice farming cooperative with acres given to local families growing highly profitable heirloom grain varieties The estate provides equipment and training to work the land organically the families care for it and they split the harvesting profits There used to be farming families here and now there are says Salani Thennakoon proudly the next morning as she talks me through the community model Employed as a naturalist by the hotel she s dressed in full khaki uniform and has taken me to see the paddies while on a bird watching walk It s planting season and in the coolness of dawn farm hands in cloth hats and wellies have emerged to work the sodden fields We spot a black headed ibis its giant beak like a wizard s wand nosing for insects alongside leggy wading birds such as snow white cattle egrets pond herons and red wattled lapwings Located in Wellawaya the rice paddies of Kaduruketha s agrotourism estate are popular with native bird species of painted storks pond herons and red wattled lapwings Photographs by Simon Urwin Our route back into the forest weaves among black pepper creepers and fig and tamarind trees A crested serpent eagle rustles branches above our heads and there are tantalising far off glimpses of giant squirrels a rare electric blue oriental dwarf kingfisher and Malabar pied hornbills shaking the tree canopy I hear the thud of falling mangoes and papayas as we follow a broad woodland trail During harvest season wild elephants use this path Salani tells me explaining that they are drawn out of protected areas to look for food because the wilderness they live in is shrinking As if on cue I m stopped in my tracks by a blast of firecrackers in the distance a practice Kaduruketha estate has banned but one still used by many farmers to ward off wildlife they consider pests such as peacocks and elephants In this area we see the conflict between humans and elephants a lot especially in the dry season when farmers harvest she says They destroy the farms Elephants like the rice but not just a small portion they ll eat the whole area It s not only the crops at risk but people too Recent surveys suggest the number of wild elephants in Sri Lanka has now exceeded but naturalists believe the government is downplaying the figures so as not to exacerbate increasing conflicts between humans and elephants Every day either an elephant or human dies in Sri Lanka says Salani A crossing elephant traffic sign appears beside the unfenced roadside jungle later that day as I m en route to Gal Oya National Park An alternative to busy Yala further south the park s headline attraction is its swimming elephants who routinely paddle between islands in Senanayake Samudra lake Sri Lanka s largest body of fresh water By the afternoon I m surveying that lake from a small boat one of only three allowed to operate trips here to keep tourist numbers down with naturalist guide Anuradha Herath from Gal Oya Lodge He wears long dreadlocks tied in jute string and a solitary wooden earring Like Salani he s part of a generation passionate about their country s environment Elephants roam wild in Gal Oya National Park despite coming into frequent conflict with the region s farmers Photograph by Simon Urwin Water levels are very high at the moment about This doesn t happen often says Anuradha explaining that we re actually looking at a dammed reservoir and the main source of water for eastern Sri Lanka Water levels are dictated by farming irrigation needs The weak breeze is no match for the ferocity of the sun as we putter slowly between shrinking islands and half submerged trees like a Dal√≠ painting We spot a troop of marooned grey langur monkeys on one islet and skinny buffaloes on another Trapped in their own shrinking biomes the wildlife is waiting for the high waters to recede and free them I can see so many ways to control conflict between locals and elephants but we have to get it right says Anuradha scanning the shoreline of drowned boulders with his binoculars for signs of grey hides He is worried about farming in the area increasing thanks to a major sugarcane project signed off with one of Sri Lanka s big sugar factories When the elephants food dries up they sometimes go to the villages and try to take their food Walking with the Vedda There are no signs of elephants until we alight for masala chai and butter cake on a tiny hill of an island with old traces of straw like dung at the top Scaling the steep rockface I can see the furthest boundaries of the lake an irregularly shaped jawline of mountains where any manner of life could be hiding Less than a century ago this area known as Danigala was an ancestral home of Sri Lanka s Indigenous Vedda people Archaeologists have traced the gene pool of these forest dwellers back to the prehistoric Balangoda Man the earliest inhabitants of Sri Lanka who lived up to years ago Their hunter gatherer way of life remained remarkably intact in this area until the waters were dammed to create the reservoir in and the national park boundaries were drawn the same year Slowly but surely the Vedda were forced out of the jungles Gal Oya Lodge has spent years developing tourism activities with these displaced people as a way of acknowledging their significance to the area and Sri Lankan history The next morning in the lodge s thatched poolside lounge pavilion I meet Danigala Maha Bandalage Jaye a Vedda community elder who is to accompany me on a jungle trek before Anuradha and I set up our overnight camp on the edge of the national park Gentle eyed bare chested and barefoot he carries a hand chiselled axe and bow and tells me he was born in a cave not far away Now Jaye says he remembers being six or seven when his parents relocated to build a mud brick house in the community of Rathugala on the park s edge While the jungle is home to many natural treasures collecting medicinal plants and honey is a laborious task for Sri Lanka s indigenous Vedda people Photograph by Simon Urwin With the jungle being so untamed our aim on this hike is to take advantage of natural paths cleared by elephants If we see elephants the main thing is don t panic instructs Anuradha from behind as I take my place in a line with Jaye in front of me heading southbound beneath a punishingly hot clear blue sky It dawns on me that now we re at ground level we re not hoping to see elephants quite the opposite But as the forest closes in on us I can smell them The fresher the elephant dung on our path the stronger the scent I consider that they might even be watching us from behind the giant wall of banyans Talking through a translator I ask Jaye if the elephants trouble him and he gives me a quizzical look shrugging as if they re as much a part of the land as the earth he walks on or the air he breathes Through the eyes of Jaye I see the jungle s many treasures We collect grape sized turkey berries and curry leaves for our camp dinner and pause to pop tiny citrussy sweet jackal jujube fruit in our mouths He picks apart the fibres of aralu creepers to show why they ve been used since time immemorial to make the Vedda s hunting bow strings strong and shows me shy mimosa plants that curl up and hide as we brush past It s a good antiseptic You chew it and then put it in the wound explains Jaye Though the Vedda are still free to collect medicinal plants and honey in the jungles Sri Lanka s Wildlife Conservation Act was the death knell for many of their hunter gatherer traditions Most villagers and Vedda still want wild meat on their table says Anuradha as we pause to check a leopard monitoring camera in a woodland clearing There on the small screen I m shown a poacher with a lifeless grey langur monkey slung across his back But the camera reveals a cast of thousands endangered thick tailed pangolins barking deer fishing cats elephants and the elusive leopard have all passed by here in the last fortnight Whatever animal you expect to see in Sri Lanka it s here in Gal Oya says Anuradha The area s leopard monitoring project was derailed by the pandemic but resurrected last year with cameras operational around the park The lodge plays a key role with its naturalist guides logging data from the images at its on site research centre Before Covid different leopards had been identified around the park We think there are more than there were a couple of decades ago but we don t know for sure says Anuradha as we press on Nobody has done research on this before Not more than minutes from our camp for the night he motions for me to stop moving with a small hand waver then puts his finger to his lips Elephants he whispers I hear them before I see them one two then three of them sluggishly emerge into a bright forest clearing their trunks stripping branches for food They are there one minute and gone the next the dense vegetation providing a cloak of invisibility as they sense our presence and drift away I never quite shake the feeling that we are walking in the footsteps of these gentle giants There s another lone wanderer on a hill overlooking our camp for the night Our base is a broad spit of land with a glassy lake on one side with fishing boats tied up at the bank On the other there are sunken rice paddies dotted with shacks on wooden platforms where farmers have retreated from the baking heat As dusk falls and fires are lit to create a perimeter around the camp elephants start to trumpet nearby Yet the night passes peacefully with cooling breezes and a cocooning stillness proving a soothing sleep tonic Visitors to Gal Oya Lodge can experience forest nature walks camping trips cooking classes and safaris led by naturalist experts such as Anuradha Herath Photographs by Simon Urwin The wild east coast From Gal Oya the forests of Sri Lanka spread out south east compressing expanding and linking back up as a series of national parks and liminal spaces on the map Together they create near fluid wildlife corridors towards the east coast s surf Two days later having left Gal Oya and made it to the beach I find myself in a tuk tuk with Len Porter a white haired Brit with a deep appreciation for Sri Lanka s technicolour biodiversity He realised years ago just how special this undeveloped southeastern quarter was Against the odds dealt out by the devastation of the tsunami and Sri Lankan Civil War of both of which ravaged this area he built a beachfront home called Kottukal Beach House in the Tamil town of Pottuvil now managed as a small hotel by Sri Lanka s Jetwing group The thing that attracted me is that between here and Kumana National Park which is eastern Yala there s nothing he says as we wobble to a standstill on a dirt track beside Rottai lake three miles inland from the surf lashed sea Within spitting distance of the east coast s renowned surf waves Kottukal Beach House built by Len Porter sits on the sands of Pottuvil Photograph by Simon Urwin We re here late in the afternoon because Len and his local driver friend Mohammed Lafeer say there are almost always elephants at this time Mohammed turns to me with a toothy grin when we see them their sodden hides blackened by the water they re wading in Spectacular arcs of water fizzle into the air as they tug reeds and lotus leaves out of the water shaking them to remove root mud before stuffing them in their mouths There s a mugger crocodile mouth agape to keep cool camouflaged in the grasses and a pond heron balancing on a floating lotus pad Behind the elephants fisherfolk silently slip through the water in blue canoes At our backs a farmer ushers his herd of buffaloes into a river then lifts his shirt around his waist and follows them in It s more wildlife than I ve seen anywhere in one place on the trip but also a reminder of how the animal and human worlds intertwine on the island The elephants keep moving in a tight knit herd as we watch them slip away peacefully Soon it s time for me to drift on too back to Pottuvil where the rhythms of the jungle give way to the equally hypnotic roar of the sea How to do it Asia specialist Experience Travel Group offers tailor made tours of Sri Lanka A night itinerary including hiking with the Vedda and
