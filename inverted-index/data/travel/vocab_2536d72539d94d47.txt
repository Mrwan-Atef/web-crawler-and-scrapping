Campion Jan min read Share A lovely ancient town in the lowlands between the Balkan and Rhodope mountains Plovdiv is the perfect place to recharge for a couple of days if you are coming to Bulgaria for an adventure And with a serious food and drink scene and numerous historical and cultural sites to explore itâ s a great choice for a southern European city break in its own right Until recently Plovdiv was almost unknown outside of Bulgaria but received a tourism boost following its stint as European Capital of Culture in It s taken over years but Europeâ s oldest city is finally trending Day one Plovdiv s Roman amphitheatre dates from the century Â Nickolay Kunev Advertisement Morning A great stay in Plovdiv starts in Kapana the oldest part of town and begins with a breakfast of palachinki sweet or savoury pancakes at Monkey House Take a seat outside on the cobbles of ul Zlatarska drink Plovdivâ s best coffee and do some people watching as the town wakes up Afterwards meander through the narrow streets a little more the word kapana means â a trapâ but there is nothing sinister around the corners of this labyrinth â only more quirky hipster cafes and bakeries Close by on ul Saborna is the City Gallery of Fine Arts which displays sculptures paintings and photographs by Bulgariaâ s greatest artists Later in the morning walk up to Plovdivâ s landmark the century Roman Amphitheatre on ul Tsar Ivaylo Also known as the Ancient Theatre of Philippopolis the site is one of the best preserved ancient theatres in the world These days the seat auditorium hosts many of Plovdivâ s open air events from operas to cultural festivals On the way back down from the amphitheatre step inside the Church of Sveta Bogoroditsa to listen to a Bulgarian Orthodox service Afternoon For lunch try a warm slice of banitsa cheese filled pastry a plate of chushki burek peppers stuffed with cheese or Bulgariaâ s ubiquitous shopska salad a bowl of tomatoes cucumbers peppers onion and cheese Grazhdansky Klubb on Stoyan Chalakov street is a local favourite Then walk a couple of streets east of Kapana to see the most lavish example of Plovdivâ s century architecture at Balabanov House The house used to be a mansion for a succession of wealthy Bulgarian merchants but since being restored in the the ground floor has been an exhibition of modern Bulgarian art Close to Balabanov House is the equally beautiful Ethnographical Museum with a flower garden in its courtyard Advertisement When the sun goes down go back to the heart of Kapana where the tiny intimate Pavaj restaurant on ul Zlatarska creates brilliant modern dishes from locally sourced ingredients Depending which nightcap you fancy stay at Pavaj to sample their selection of rakia Bulgariaâ s delicious spirit made from grapes and other fruits go to Vino Culture â also on ul Zlatarska â to taste some local wines or try Plovdivâ s first craft beer bar Kotka i Mishka Cat and Mouse on ul Hristo Dyukmedzhiev which serves four beers from its own brewery Day two Be sure to climb up at least one of Plovdiv s seven hills Â Maya Karkalicheva Getty Images Morning Plovdiv in Bulgaria is built on seven little hills and you canâ t visit without clambering up at least one of them So before you set off pop in to Klebarnitsa Kapana one of Plovdivâ s divine bakeries to load up on carbs try kifli â pastries filled with marmalade and fuel up with some more potent Bulgarian espresso Within the old town itself is a hill named Nebet Tepe At the top of the mound are the Ruins of Eumolpias â the remnants of an ancient Thracian settlement called Eumolpias dating from BCE From Nebet Tepe there is also a pretty panoramic view of Plovdiv At the bottom of the hill are the remains of another ancient ruin the Stadium of Philippopolis While you are in this part of town step inside Atanas Krastev House on Chomakov street to see another lavish example of Bulgarian architecture Mr Krastev himself was a local painter as well as a champion of Plovdivâ s history and culture His house and its beautiful garden now display his portraits and collections of abstract art Afternoon For lunch get a table at Smokini on ul Zlatarska The restaurant serves brilliant Bulgarian dishes soups and hearty salads with a modern international twist For the rest of the afternoon take a final stroll around the town It won t take long to climb up some more of the hills Dzhambaz Tepe and Taksim Tepe are only high but both have lovely panoramic views of the valley beneath After you climb down step inside Plovdiv s oldest church the Church of Sveti Konstantin Elena and visit the century Dzhumaya Mosque At the end of your stay in Plovdiv tear yourself away from the â trapâ of the old town and take the short walk back to the amphitheatre to see the marble steps lit up under the stars You might also like Four scenic drives in the Balkans Bulgaria rocks a hikerâ s guide to five geological wonders Skiing hiking climbing
