comes in pre trip planning which includes assessing their pet s comfort level and safety Photograph By Steve Marcus Reuters Redux By Sarah Kuta February Cats and dogs are not just pets These lovable four legged creatures have become our closest companions and confidantes with more than half of American pet owners now reporting that they consider pets as much a part of their family as human members So not surprisingly more pet parents want to bring their furry friends along when they travel In response the travel industry is now rolling out the red carpet for both human and animal guests with offerings ranging from pet friendly hotel packages to flights designed specifically for dogs There s been a clear uptick in travelers seeking to bring their pets along for the ride and they re sparing no expense says LaDell Carter a Baltimore based luxury travel advisor and the founder of Royal Expression Travels It s no longer just a niche market it s a full blown trend If you re not sure whether to bring your pet along while traveling or you re looking for tips to keep them happy and healthy during an upcoming trip these animal and travel experts offer some helpful guidance Pet owners should carefully consider whether traveling is really in the best interest of their four legged friend taking their pet s preferences and personality into account Some animals have an adventurous spirit and love to travel while others don t says veterinarian Lilian Wong Photograph Eduardo Munoz Reuters Redux Put your pet s well being first Long before you start drafting a packing list consider your pet s well being first Though you may be excited at the prospect of bringing your pooch or kitty along for the journey your pet may not feel the same way and travel could be harmful to their health This is especially true for senior pets or those with existing medical issues You know your pet best but it s always a good idea to touch base with your veterinarian says Lilian Wong a veterinarian and clinical skills instructor at Oregon State University s Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine Beyond your pet s health think about their preferences and personality Are they an anxious homebody who thrives on routine or more of a social butterfly who loves exploring It really depends on the animal says Wong Some animals have an adventurous spirit and love to travel while others don t Certain types of trips also lend themselves better to bringing pets than others for example a weekend camping getaway versus an international business conference Imagine the entire travel experience from the moment you leave home until the moment you return from your pet s perspective Related More travel tips on how you can travel safely with animals on a plane Determine when to travel without your pet Sometimes the right decision may be going it alone If you know travel will make your pet uncomfortable or that the trip just won t be pet friendly consider hiring a pet sitter or booking a kennel at a boarding facility instead And if you re traveling during a busy time of the year make these types of arrangements as early as possible because they tend to book up quickly Wong recommends jotting down a list of pros and cons Many times loving pet parents have the best intentions but traveling can be stressful for some animals she says Animals might not understand all the sights and sounds of an airplane or a new city Consider the mode of travel If you ve decided to bring your pet along the next decision is how to reach your desired destination If possible Wong recommends road tripping You can take as many breaks as you and your pet need she says You can drive to a nearby veterinary hospital if there is a medical emergency When you are traveling on a plane you don t have that flexibility Driving isn t always possible or practical so you might look into flying But air travel for non service animals can be complicated since each airline has its own rules and requirements and those rules can also vary depending on the departure and arrival destinations the weather the type of animal or breed the pet s age and vaccination status and more Generally speaking unless your pet is small enough to fit in a carrier underneath the seat in front of you for the entire flight they will have to fly in the plane s cargo hold This is a deal breaker for many pet parents says Brandi Munden a spokeswoman for the American Kennel Club If you re flying internationally or to certain domestic locations like Hawaii you will also need to read up on local animal import laws Many require pets to quarantine so depending on the length of your stay it may not make sense to bring your pet In addition most airlines can only accommodate a handful of pets per flight so book early and call to ensure there s a spot for your pet If you can afford it another option is flying private or semi private which Carter recommends to all of her clients This mode of travel offers the ultimate peace of mind she says Your pet can sit on your lap or even sometimes roam free in the cabin with no worries about crates size restrictions or last minute changes at the gate A handful of airlines including Bark Air and Jets offer private pay per seat charters specifically designed for pets and their owners Private jet companies like NetJets and VistaJet meanwhile will also gladly accommodate pets But be forewarned These flights are not cheap often costing several thousand dollars one way The private charters which tend to be more affordable than a fully private plane also only fly certain routes Related Traveling with pets overseas A guide to some quirky rules Planning a pet friendly itinerary Getting there is only one small piece of planning a pet friendly trip You ll also need to think about lodging logistics social dynamics and other factors once you arrive Consider if you can manage the extra responsibility of caring for your pet while traveling says Munden Ask yourself these and other questions Does your hotel or vacation rental allow pets And if so do they have any special fees or rules Many hotels only allow a certain number of pets per room and some have breed restrictions Others prohibit pets from being left alone in guest rooms which means you ll need to bring your pet everywhere you go What s on your itinerary and how pet friendly is the destination Will your pet spend the entire day cooped up in a strange place while you re out and about or will you be able to bring them with you to shops restaurants and activities If you re staying with family do they have a setup that s conducive to pets and more importantly does your family even like pets How does your pet react to children or other animals If your pet has a medical issue where s the closest veterinarian and how will you get there Preparing for the trip Once you ve finalized the details give yourself ample time to prepare for your pet friendly trip If you re traveling internationally you ll likely need to find and visit a U S Department of Agriculture accredited veterinarian who can sign off on the required health certificates says Wong This process can take weeks or months so start early Many pet owners don t realize how much advanced planning is involved she says In addition to packing your belongings remember to leave room for your pet s necessities says Munden This includes food treats any medications leashes harnesses or collars water bowls dog beds toys litter and litter boxes and any crates or carriers Also bring a paper or digital copy of your pet s vaccination records as well as any required documentation for traveling with a pet Especially if this will be their first time traveling it helps to familiarize your pet with the upcoming situation If you ve purchased a new pet carrier for example start using it at home Before a road trip spend some time driving around so your pet feels comfortable in the car Once you arrive give them some time to get acclimated and unpack their favorite blankets or toys right away to help make the space feel more like home says Munden Be sure to pet proof the space too and for dogs always keep poop bags at the ready Block off any area you don t want them to access Munden adds Be respectful by cleaning up after your pet Be flexible A common phrase that travel professionals often say Pack your patience This adage is especially true when traveling with pets which are living breathing creatures with minds of their own Go into the trip with a mindset that at least one thing will go wrong or at least not exactly as you anticipated and always have a backup plan Set your expectations appropriately so you don t become frustrated or disappointed and do more research than you think is necessary And if you don t want to leave anything up to chance Carter recommends working with a travel advisor She explains We make sure all the logistics are handled so all that s left is enjoying the journey together This article was published on November and updated on February Sarah Kuta is a freelance journalist based in Longmont Colorado Follow her on Instagram and X Related
