guide to the messiest festival Sarah Reid May min read Share If youâ ve ever wanted to be saturated with tomatoes La Tomatina is the occasion to realize that particular dream Â Zowy Voeten Getty Images If itâ s the last Wednesday in August itâ s got to be the worldâ s messiest festival In BuÃ ol Spain â miles west of Valencia â La Tomatina festival is a wild silly and very very saucy tomato throwing spectacle that draws produce pitching revelers each year If youâ ve always dreamed of throwing your um tomato in the ring hereâ s all the information you need to squeeze the most out of this chaotic one of a kind celebration There s no doubt La Tomatina is the world s biggest and messiest tomato fight Â Pablo Blazquez Dominguez Getty Images What is La Tomatina The ticketed mayhem takes place in Plaza del Pueblo BuÃ olâ s main square and Calle Cid At around the palo â a large greased pole with a ham attached to its end â is hoisted into the air A mad scramble ensues as people struggle against each other to pull it down Advertisement At precisely regardless of whether someone has successfully grabbed the ham which is rare a firework provides a signal to parked trucks to start tipping over tons of overripe squishy tomatoes onto the square For the next hour everyone joins in a frenzied cheerful anarchic tomato battle â until a second firework signals the end of play Why does this wacky tradition exist The festival dates to according to the La Tomatina website when a kerfuffle during a cultural parade in BuÃ ol led to a market stall of vegetables falling victim to a fired up crowd Townsfolk reportedly revived the food fight the following year bringing their own tomatoes from home After the festival was banned in the early a â tomato burialâ held in protest in paved the way for La Tomatina to be recognized as an official festival Since the festival has been ticketed to limit total attendance to a somewhat manageable You havenâ t done really La Tomatina unless youâ Are still finding bits of tomato in your hair up your nose under your nails and between your butt cheeks for days or even weeks after the festival While you wonâ t literally be swimming in tomatoes wearing a swimsuit to La Tomatina is not a bad idea Â Biel Alino AFP via Getty Images What to pack for La Tomatina Most important a change of clothes including shoes You can usually leave this on the coach youâ ll take to BuÃ ol if not bring a backpack style dry bag BuÃ ol City Council now provides showers so you can freshen up to a degree before you get back on your bus Pack a chest strap if youâ re planning to film the action with a GoPro as youâ ll need your hands free for hurling tomatoes or shielding yourself from tomatoes being lobbed at you And a fully waterproof phone case with a sturdy neck strap for your phone â if you dare to bring it What to wear to La Tomatina Wear old clothes and closed in shoes with decent grip and a pair of swimming goggles to protect your eyes â that acidic tomato juice can really sting Ski goggles will also work but these can be pulled off more easily Leave your hat behind Advertisement Outer layers commonly get ripped off in the fray so we recommend that women wear a tight sports bra or a crop style bikini top and a swimsuit bottom underneath and that men sport a snug Speedo How long does the tomato fight last Expect the tomato tossing to last for about an hour The chaos concludes after the second firework â You say tomato I say â Â Pablo Blazquez Dominguez Getty Images La Tomatina the â doâ list Do ensure your tomatoes are fully squashed before you throw them This will help to avoid injuring someone Be warned though that others wonâ t always be so kind Do remember to look up Locals join in by pelting festivalgoers with their own tomato supplies from apartments above the square Do look out for your mates and the people around you La Tomatina gets pretty hectic If youâ re not big on crowds mess and discomfort this isnâ t the festival for you Do stop throwing tomatoes when the second firework goes off Thatâ s when itâ s all over folks Do verify your travel insurance The festival ticket price includes insurance make sure the policy provides adequate coverage for your needs La Tomatina the â donâ tâ list Donâ t bother trying to avoid getting pelted with fruit Just let it happen Donâ t wear any jewelry Hoop earrings in particular these can get ripped out painfully Donâ t bring bottles or hard objects You wonâ t be allowed to bring them into the festival area Donâ t get too close to the tomato trucks You really donâ t want to get pushed under those tires Donâ t drink too much alcohol the night before or the morning of The stench of rotting tomatoes in the midsummer sun is no fun with a hangover On that note drink plenty of water before you enter the festival it gets very hot waiting around for the fun to begin Donâ t get too rough Pushing shoving and ripping peopleâ s clothing on purpose is not OK The tomatoes come from all angles during the hour long frenzy â so keep your eyes peeled Â Jose Miguel Fernandez AFP via Getty Images How do I get to La Tomatina It takes roughly an hour by bus to reach BuÃ ol from Valencia All festival tickets purchased via the La Tomatina website now include return same day bus transport from other cities in Spain such as Barcelona Madrid Alicante AlmerÃ a Benidorm DÃ nia Calpe and Cartagena so you can just come for the messy day if you like Keep in mind that buses from Barcelona depart at What should I do if I want to return with a great story Have a go at climbing that greasy pole What is the biggest no no at La Tomatina Bringing anything to the festival that youâ re not comfortable losing Where should I stay Most festivalgoers who arenâ t just busing in for the day spend opt to stay in Valencia so book early You can also book hostel and hotel accommodations through the La Tomatina website if youâ re keen to mingle with other attendees A range of other operators including Busabout also offer festival packages If youâ re traveling independently consider staying in BuÃ ol for the week long celebration which involves music dancing parades and fireworks The night before the fight a paella cooking competition is held Book as early as possible to secure accommodation in town La Tomatina is surely the messiest festival in the world Â Iakov Filimonov Shutterstock Can I bring children to La Tomatina Thereâ s no age restriction at the festival but weâ d advise against bring young kids as things can get very rowdy dozens of people get injured every year Itâ s easy to become separated in the fray so if you do bring children arrange a meeting point before the festival gets underway and use a permanent marker to write your phone number on their arm s A safer option for kids is the La Tomatina Infantil Tomatina Kids event ages held in Plaza del Pueblo the week before the main festival This yearâ s â mini battle â which lasts up to minutes will take place at noon on August What can I do after the festival One of the benefits of staying in Valencia is the easy access to the official after party held in the city with tickets available from the La Tomatina website The birthplace of paella Valencia is a beautiful coastal city well worth sticking around to explore afterward Is La Tomatina a waste of food The low quality tomatoes purchased cheaply for the festival are on the turn or already rotten so they are unlikely to have had an alternative future in someoneâ s salad I missed out on this year â â how do I start planning for next year Tickets are already on sale for and will sell out â so book soon Bookmark the official ticket site to be first in line for tickets which go on sale several months before the
