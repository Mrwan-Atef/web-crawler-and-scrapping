Things To Do Do Where To Eat Eat Need To Know Know The Fodor s Five The five things you need to know before traveling to Madrid An afternoon nap is essential and you ll soon understand why Never understood the importance of a siesta Wait until you visit Madrid The city is famous for its nightlife and so locals follow a different rhythm of life than most Breakfast tends to be light lunch is the main meal of the day usually between p m and dinner doesn t tend to start until p m And don t think you ll be in bed by nightlife rarely starts before midnight and many bars stay open until dawn That afternoon nap suddenly feels a lot more necessary Don t bother renting a car in Madrid Public transport is the way to go Whatever you do don t try to drive in Madrid This will help both your stress levels and your finances parking is limited and expensive The city has a great public transport network with a metro bus and train system that covers most of the key neighborhoods that you ll want to explore The best way to get around is by buying a tourist travel pass which offers unlimited travel across all public transport for a certain number of days Stay in the center of the city for easy access especially if you re only visiting for a few days Expect to eat dinner standing up and share it After a heavy lunch dinner often looks like tapas or raciones shared with friends Madrid is renowned for its tapas culture and the most authentic places are usually the noisy atmospheric a little too cozy for comfort standing room only spots Many places offer free tapas with every drink you order so you can sample different specialties without breaking the bank Raciones are larger tapas portions but we d recommend going on a little tapas crawl first to truly discover the tastes of the city Dress to impress if you want to blend in Madrid is a stylish city and locals like to dress well You won t see many people wearing shorts flip flops or sweatpants even in the summer Instead you ll see elegant outfits and full faces of make up with accessories and shoes to match If you want to blend in pack some smart casual clothes and avoid anything too flashy or revealing You ll also want a
