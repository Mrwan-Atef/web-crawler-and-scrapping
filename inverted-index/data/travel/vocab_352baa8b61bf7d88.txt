And an unexpected illness can strike at any time That s why almost every ship has a medical center staffed by a physician though it s best to educate yourself on ways to avoid common onboard ailments so you never have to go there Contents Hide INSIDER TIP Outbreaks of serious illness on cruise ships are exceedingly rare but they do happen The Medical Center All travelers should carry a small first aid kit with adequate supplies for minor scrapes and ailments For any health issues that fall beyond that the ship s doctor should be able to treat you as can any general practitioner or clinic ashore If you re examined by the ship s doctor you ll be charged for your office visit a regular visit can be around but more extensive treatments can be several hundred dollars Any medicines prescribed are extra and the ship s pharmacy will be limited in scope A notable exception is if you re injured in some manner aboard the ship or during a cruise sponsored shore excursion in which case your treatment should be free But ships are not really equipped for complex health emergencies which may require evacuation by boat or helicopter for which you will be charged A visit to the ship s doctor isn t free Be sure your travel insurance covers medical evacuation from the ship Most U S health insurance plans do not cover treatment on board cruise ships or sometimes any treatment outside the United States Common Ailments Several ailments are more common among cruise passengers This is one reason you may be asked to fill out a health questionnaire as you board your ship You will be asked to verify that you do not have any serious medical symptoms like fever or nausea and are not aware of having been exposed to any communicable diseases It s best to answer these questions honestly Seasickness The most common ailment to trouble cruise passengers is seasickness Modern vessels are equipped with stabilizers that eliminate much of the motion responsible for seasickness but that doesn t necessarily mean that you won t get seasick on a large cruise ship You need not suffer however as several treatments are available The most common drugs are Dramamine and Bonine these are over the counter antihistamines that are available at most pharmacies If you want to avoid medication you may wish to explore a few homeopathic and natural remedies for seasickness like consuming bitters ginger or stomach settling foods like crackers and apples Taking in fresh air and keeping an eye on the horizon simply lying down and acupressure wristbands called Sea Band can help alleviate symptoms too Influenza When you re traveling the risk for exposure to influenza depends on the time of year and destination Influenza might be at best an inconvenience however it can lead to complications including life threatening pneumonia An annual influenza vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza Noroviruses Noroviruses are a group of related viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis in humans Highly contagious noroviruses are transmitted primarily through the fecal oral route either by consumption of contaminated food or water or by direct person to person contact Symptoms of norovirus infection include vomiting diarrhea with abdominal cramps and nausea Low grade fever occasionally occurs too Dehydration is the most common complication especially among the young and elderly and may require medical attention Symptoms generally last to hours and recovery is usually complete there s no evidence of any serious long term effect Cruise lines that sail to and from the United States must report all instances of norovirus to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Proper hand washing is the best way to prevent norovirus Avoiding Illness No one wants to get sick during a highly anticipated vacation but there are ways you can minimize your chances of getting sick The best way to prevent all illness is to wash your hands thoroughly and often especially after using the restroom and before eating and drinking When water is not available use a hand sanitizer On most cruise ships hand sanitizer is provided near all entry points and at all dining venues Some passengers even bring antiseptic wipes to treat the surfaces of their rooms If you do become ill it s always best to observe any recommended quarantine procedures so that you do not infect other passengers What to Bring If you pack a basic travel first aid kit you ll be prepared for minor emergencies and may not have to call on the ship s medical staff for every minor incident A Travel First Aid Kit adhesive bandages waterless antibacterial hand sanitizer antinausea medication antacid tablets seasickness remedy prescription medications keep in original containers compression stockings for long flights first aid antibacterial cream aspirin or nonaspirin pain reliever antidiarrheal medication antihistamine zipper top plastic bags or ice bag dental adhesive or a dental
