What happens when a cruise ship becomes a hot zone TRAVEL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE stranded at sea What happens when a cruise ship becomes a hot zone More than ships are floating off the U S coast waiting for a sign they can come home Cunard s Queen Mary ocean liner arrived in Southampton England from Australia on April with passengers who were unable to fly due to medical conditions The coronavirus COVID pandemic has spread to many countries across the world claiming over lives and infecting over million people Photograph by Naomi Baker Getty Images By Brendan Borrell April min read The last place anyone wants to be during the coronavirus pandemic is stranded aboard a cruise ship where disease can spread with lightning speed This week the last or so passengers aboard three cruise ships stuck at sea will be coming into port at last The Pacific Princess and the MSC Magnifica are scheduled to berth today in California and France with passengers who will be transferred into home isolation The Costa Deliziosa had to evacuate one passenger with health issues last week at the port in Marsala Italy The ship s nearly passengers were reportedly quarantined until a coronavirus test came back negative and the ship is said to be disembarking most of them in Barcelona today before returning to Genoa Italy with its remaining Italian citizens There are still additional ships in U S waters with crew members of varying nationalities on board with no clear timeline for when and how they will all return to their home countries some of which have closed their borders Related How hard

Francisco Photograph by Petty Officer Class Taylor Bacon U S Coast Guard District AP Since the March no sail order issued by the U S Centers for Disease Control CDC the agency has helped bring more than citizens and foreign nationals into home isolation At least cruises have had passengers testing positive for COVID We ve even had people coming back positive from Nile River cruises says Cindy Friedman a medical epidemiologist who leads the CDC s cruise ship team Even when quarantined inside their cabin passengers are not necessarily shielded from infection says Joacim Rocklöv an epidemiologist at Umeå University in Sweden Rocklöv estimates that a single person on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship in January infected others a rate four times higher than observed in Wuhan China where the new coronavirus virus first emerged Rocklöv suggests this could ve been partly due to a super spreader event such as a social engagement on board where the first infected passenger or passengers mingled with uninfected ones Passengers began to disembark from the Grand Princess cruise ship at the Port of Oakland in Oakland California on March Photograph by JOSH EDELSON AFP Getty Images Related Here s how to fight germs wherever you go The virus is primarily transmitted through small respiratory droplets which can spread on surfaces through close contact and possibly the ship s ventilation system Crew members packed up to eight to a room and delivering food to passengers can also expedite its spread The disease has been particularly insidious because as many as a quarter of people who get it may not show symptoms and infected individuals can spread the virus to others before they show symptoms Because cruise ship passengers tend to be older than the overall U S population they are also most susceptible to becoming critically ill or dying Michael Callahan a medical doctor and infectious disease expert at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston participated in medical evacuations of the Diamond Princess and Grand Princess cruise ships He says that if it were up to him cruises around the world should have been immediately evacuated and passengers and crews quarantined inside hotels for days You ve got to break the chain of infection he says Diamond Princess evacuation The true scale of the threat of COVID first became clear with the outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess The infection is thought to have been brought on board by an year old Chinese man who had disembarked by the time his positive test came back on February Even after guests were sequestered in their cabins and the ship docked in Yokohama Japan the disease continued to spread among the passengers and crew The first cases were confirmed on February Japanese authorities removed sick passengers one by one and treated them at a local hospital but passengers were otherwise confined on board Members of the Filipino Community Center protest perceived lack of

with emails and phone calls from passengers and family members the CDC waited a week to authorize a quarantine operation at which point more than passengers had tested positive along with crew members including many in food service Inconsistent testing and delays in receiving the results however meant that many more were likely infected The U S had never conducted a large scale mission to evacuate citizens from abroad amid an infectious disease outbreak Doing it on a cruise ship That was new too There was no rulebook says Callahan A little known agency inside the Department of Health and Human Services known as the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response kicked into action Officials there cobbled together teams of doctors nurse practitioners nurses and pharmacists and brought in Callahan and another infectious disease expert both veterans of Ebola hot zones in African nations Related Learn how the coronavirus compares to Ebola flu and other outbreaks James Lawler a medical doctor and co executive director of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center got the call on a Tuesday and was on a plane to Japan the next day having plunked down a government grant to buy pressurized bio containment suits That s a lot of extra carry on bags he says Because of the virus s high fatality rate as high as one to two percent the team treated the entire cruise ship as a hot zone meaning they had to use the strictest infection control procedures A tent set up at the farthest end of the dock was used to remove and decontaminate or dispose of their gear upon stepping off the vessel Doctors scrutinized Diamond Princess s manifest to identify American citizens and checked on each one beginning with passengers most at risk including the elderly and those with conditions such as diabetes or mobility issues A pharmacist based in the ship s library maintained radio contact obtaining appropriate prescription refills from Japanese pharmacies Once cleared Americans wearing masks were then taken by bus to two cargo planes and flown to quarantine on military bases in the United States Eleven passengers would end up testing positive by the time they arrived and were flown on to Nebraska Three more would fall ill later An additional Americans were either hospitalized in Japan or remained there for other reasons Overall the Diamond Princess outbreak infected passengers and killed Had the passengers been isolated and quarantined on February those actions likely would have prevented at least infections according to an analysis in the Journal of Travel Medicine A passenger cheers as medical personnel begin to move travelers from the Grand Princess cruise ship onto airplanes at Oakland International Airport Photograph by JOSH EDELSON AFP Getty Images It was absolutely the right move to get Americans off Lawler says The March cruise ship evacuation of the Grand Princess which began miles off the coast of California proved to be even more harrowing for rescue workers Amid rough waters the medical team had to leap from a small Coast Guard vessel to a lifeboat and on to a ladder dangling from the cruise ship all while wearing clumsy bio containment suits A mistake would have resulted in severe injury or death from drowning or crushing injury between the two vessels reads a government commendation letter given to Bryan Lovejoy a nurse practitioner on that mission All aboard In the six weeks since the Grand Princess medical evacuation cruise ship quarantine procedures have changed as COVID has become endemic in U S communities and as various states and localities have enacted social distancing measures Under CDC oversight cruise lines are responsible for getting passengers safely into home quarantine through charter flights and buses Symptomatic and asymptomatic passengers are separated while the Coast Guard and ambulances handle those needing medical evacuation With a vaccine not expected until next year it remains unclear when cruises will be safe On April the CDC s no sail order was extended for days or until the agency rescinds it With this pandemic it s really not advised to go on a cruise says the CDC s Friedman Princess Cruises Holland America and Carnival Cruises have canceled all their bookings through the middle of the summer though reservations are reportedly up for In a statement Cruise Lines International Association said that cruising is neither the source or cause of the virus or its spread and that it would be a false assumption to connect higher frequency and visibility in reporting to a higher frequency of infection Related What to do if your vacation has been canceled Carolyn Wright a Santa Fe New Mexico based photographer who was quarantined on the Grand Princess in Oakland in March says that she and a friend have a reservation for a cruise in Germany this fall I m certainly not looking forward to the Viking Cruise like I was
