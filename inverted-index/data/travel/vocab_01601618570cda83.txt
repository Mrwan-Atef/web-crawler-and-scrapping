Feb min read Share Vineyard in Sonoma County California Shutterstock A trip to one of the USA s picturesque wine regions can mean hopping from one winery to the next stopping to taste different varietals and maybe grazing a selection of cheese and charcuterie while youâ re at it But a vacation in wine country is about so much more than well wine Itâ s like taking a ski vacation with friends and the non skiers in the group still having a total blast â snowshoeing aprÃ sing hot tubbing and generally enjoying a wonderful time The same is true of wine country The sober curious in the group â and among millennials that number is steadily increasing â who aren t inclined to start sipping big bold reds at on a Saturday or at all can rest assured that these beautiful places welcome them too From hiking biking and discovering the nuances of a wineryâ s new no ABV vintage to eating fresh seasonally prepared dishes and checking out the local art a sober trip to wine country is not just possible but also a terrific idea What to think about when looking for sober experiences Make sure that you pick a destination that has more than just sprawling wineries around town In addition to delicious food and drink take a look at what other extracurriculars and excursions are available during the time of year you plan to visit Advertisement Mount Hood above the vineyards in the
