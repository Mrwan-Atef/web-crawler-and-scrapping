How to plan a weekend in South Moravia Czech wine country The Czech Republic s southeast shows an unexpected side to the country one of Germanic villages and ancient forests where wine not beer is king By Sarah Gillespie July min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Welcome to Czech wine country a tapestry of green vineyards glassy lakes and red roofed sandstone villages Put away that stein South Moravia has almost as many wine cellars as residents Following decades of Communist wrought destruction this once prestigious winemaking region is bouncing back and throwing its doors open to visitors Brno the region s capital is the Czech Republic s second largest city after Prague On the surface it s a kaleidoscope of UNESCO listed functionalism and Austro Hungarian glamour but it s worth going deeper literally into Brno s underground where you ll find shadowy catacombs and colonnaded century water tanks Catch a train south and you ll pass factories on the fringes it s not for nothing that Brno was once called the Moravian Manchester They re soon replaced by hills knotted with vines In the medieval towns of Znojmo and Mikulov people spill out of bars clinking glasses of Riesling and Pálava Scattered throughout the region are the chateaux of former kings their jewellery box interiors undimmed thanks to careful maintenance Just over the border is Vienna German speakers once made up a huge portion of South Moravia s population Expelled from Czechoslovakia following Second World War their influence is still felt in the German place names and scent of strudel emanating from cafes Day one City life creativity Morning Brno s centre is an architectural jumble of Austro Hungarian edifices and quirky sculptures Náměstí Svobody the main square is most emblematic of this at its centre is a phallic astronomical clock erected in Walk south to the Old Town Hall and climb the metre tower for a view of Špilberk Castle and the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul Descend to Cabbage Market Square which hosts a farmers market from April to October For lunch try the Asian dining scene Due to a friendship agreement between Communist Czechoslovakia and North Vietnam Brno has a huge Vietnamese community residents often joke that Brno s national dish is pho You ll find it at Diandi just off Náměstí Svobody Afternoon The main hall of the Museum of Applied Arts is dominated by artist Krištof Kintera s Demon of Growth installation a monster of Christmas baubles that wraps tendrils around the upper balustrade Galleries here showcase Czech creativity and the permanent collection includes glass ceramics porcelain and textiles Afterwards tour the UNESCO listed Villa Tugendhat a functionalist masterpiece designed by Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe in for the Jewish Tugendhat family The budget was unlimited and it shows entire walls are robed in rare zebrano wood veneer The Tugendhats enjoyed their home for only eight years before fleeing in rightly anticipating the German invasion Evening In students Jan Vlachynský and Andrej Vališ frustrated by the lack of good bars in Brno travelled to the US to gain inspiration The result is Bar který neexistuje The Bar that Doesn t Exist a New York style cocktail spot where rare spirits jostle with barrels of ageing cocktails on an illuminated feature wall Staff make their own syrups and bitters and the burgers aren t half bad either After dinner head to the theatre The biggest and arguably the most impressive is the Janáček Named for celebrated Czech composer Leoš Janáček it s a glass fronted functionalist marvel managed by Brno s National Theatre Opera is a speciality fortunately most performances are subtitled in English A barman at Bar který neexistuje The Bar That Doesn t Exist in Brno enjoys a rum cocktail called The Appointment Photograph by Oldrich hrb Day two Wines wildlife Morning Take a bus to Znojmo where until most residents spoke German Start at the

raucous it burned down the church her brother funded its reconstruction Further south ascend Vlkova Věž Wolf Tower for views of the old city walls then descend to cobbled streets where you ll likely find stalls offering VOC Znojmo wine tastings Afternoon Drop by Slepičák to try svíčková a classic Czech dish of braised steak with bread dumplings in a creamy sauce Walk it off by zigzagging down Znojmo s hillside paths to Podyjí National Park or take the bus to Mašovice to its heart At miles Podyjí is the Czech Republic s smallest national park a ribbon of meadows pine forests and vineyards skirting the river Djye From the Králův Stolec King s Chair viewpoint you may see buzzards performing silent acrobatics over the river Walk on to the Hradiště Terraces a former farming area left to grow wild for a fabulous view of Znojmo Don t fancy hiking Spend a slow afternoon wandering the Šobes vineyards within the park tasting Pinot Gris and Riesling from the winery s outdoor stand Evening Catch the bus back to Brno for some bar hopping First gird your stomach with a filling Czech meal at Lokál U Caipla Try pečená kachna a roast duck leg accompanied by cabbage apples and dumplings Next head to a café diner or cocktail bar depending when you visit with a different menu for each Beer and coffee from Brno s Rebelbean roastery feature on the cocktail menu Finish at Super Panda Circus a

south are the smaller manicured French gardens in spring they bloom with tulips To the north are the bigger wilder English gardens home to the high Minaret an ostentatious summer residence designed to
