Houston contributions of bubbles A Magical Place in Burgundy Jun family My favorite restaurant anywhere For such a famous restaurant Chef Pras and the staff maintain a humility which honors the region that the restaurant calls home The restaurant begins with a strong commitment to local ingredients and from there offers two innovative tasting menus suitable for consecutive visits during a weekend stay Those menus offer a wonderful variety of dishes Most recently we had John Dory Tuna langoustine a classic veal and squab just to name a few Don t miss the cheese course You will never forget it The impeccable service comes without any of the pretense that you might expect from such a well known restaurant On this particular visit the restaurant and hotel staff were particularly helpful in accommodating our large family group They even prepared what looked like the best chicken I have ever seen for my year old niece and arranged for her to stay with a babysitter during our meal The Sommelier Sebastien was very pleasant to work with They offered a wine pairing option that featured excellent selections all from Burgundy but the wine list is also filled with excellent bottles from the region at all price points Don t immediately pick the wine option If you stay in the hotel be sure not to miss breakfast the next morning Read more Written June This review is the subjective

Allen contributions of bubbles Terrible service to charge you a high cancellation fee Mar family I had a terrible experience with Maison Lameloise They didn t cancel my reservation when I emailed them and they charged me almost euros I was excited to have lunch there with my wife and two kids However I was very concerned about the menu For my kids they were going to offer an a la carte option For me and my wife we were going to do the lunch menu I inquired about the menu to confirm whether it was pigeon and snails I told them that if it is then I want to cancel my reservation This was several days in advance of our reservation They only responded with menus that were more than double the price higher and ignored my instructions to cancel the reservation if the menu only had pigeon and snails When I finally didn t see any cancellation I go onto to Fork and cancelled it but they said I did it too late I have emails telling them to cancel the reservation if it had that menu we didn t like and they ignored it so that they could charge me the cancellation fee I pleaded my case nicely with the restaurant and they refused to be flexible even though it was there fault They food may be good there but their approach to customer service is terrible Read more Written April This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC Tripadvisor performs

had reserved a table for for dinner the person who invited us being a regular customer The butler announced that Sic In addition if you wanted to change an imposed dish from the menu for allergy or taste there would be extra I ll call it a fine instead I find it difficult to understand that a Michelin starred chef and MOF in addition can not have a little flexibility in his service because in an order adding a fine to change the monkfish of menu with the Saint Pierre of menu is not justified the preparation time being the same at the setting up and the material st in this case g of fish at the same cost The solution is therefore to reserve tables close together one for the menu the other for the menu For my part I don t want to come back because the dishes were very good but not sublime hence my rating Read more Automatically translated Written November This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews as

pleasure of being accompanied by the historic butler of the Lameloise house who told us lots of anecdotes The tasting menu at euros is generally very good and in particular the langoustine what a delight no wow effect but desired flavors overall The only disappointment was the chocolate dessert which was really ordinary On the other hand a real disappointment at the hotel which is really not related to the restaurant The bedding is very comfortable but the bathrooms have aged well and it is quite an art to adjust the shower Read more Written October This review is the subjective opinion

Chefs with a top notch brigade A sommelier who followed us from start to finish In addition we were seated opposite a customer a food critic or something like that who allowed us to observe his gestures during his tastings it was absolutely beautiful As a result we tried to imitate him and our compositions immediately went a step further The Chef s visit to the dining room would have been

Exceptional dinner and unique moment of sharing with friends Not the slightest false grade from start to finish The team in the room makes you travel according to the dishes What a professionalism and service both discreet and warm efficient without being urgent Each dish is a work of art and the tasting menu accompanied by its food wine pairing guarantees you to spend almost hours out of time The bread is homemade in the bakery of the restaurant and worth the trip alone We really liked the room where we were contemporary while retaining the spirit of the place The chef is an artist deserving his stars for almost years Dinner extended by one night at the hotel where everything was also impeccable Breakfast the next day allows you to make the fun last And to top it all off Chef Eric Pras did us the honor of showing us around the core of the reactor and the bakery adjoining the kitchen A real pleasure to have been able to talk with this talented chef artiste thanks for these unique

euros If the price for a star remains completely acceptable not all the dishes were up to par Superb starter between tomatoes crumbled crabs and quinoa shrimp the other dishes despite the promise were not what I could have hoped for if the Bresse chicken was very good intrinsically the artichokes too the rest made tasting more difficult If the corn nourishes the chicken it was not the best effect in a dish The corn pepper bias in Mexican style was not to my taste Others will certainly like it As for the tuna beef the mixture was very interesting unfortunately the quality of the beef was not up to par Having to chew in a star is not appropriate unfortunately especially in contact with the tuna everything else was very good and the fig dessert with ratafia superb A very complete wine list and
