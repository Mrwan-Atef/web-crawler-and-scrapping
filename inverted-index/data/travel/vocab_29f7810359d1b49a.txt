Riding waves and scaling rocks around Ericeira and Sintra in Portugal TRAVEL Riding waves and scaling rocks around Ericeira and Sintra in Portugal Ericeira has established itself as the ultimate playground for European surf culture But tear yourself away from the beaches and adventures beckon inland too all less than an hour s drive from Lisbon Portuguese pro surfer Joaquim Chaves catches a wave at golden hour in the World Surf Reserve of Ericeira Photograph by Pedro Mestre By Amelia Duggan August min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK I have never until now taken time to consider the creation of a wave To fathom the climatic and gravitational forces propelling salt water across sunken topographies so that it swells rises arcs and finally dissipates in powerful fits of foam And this lack of prior attention feels like a critical failure now I m standing wetsuit plastered on awkwardly gripping a sturdy beginners softboard on one of Europe s most famous surfing beaches Instructor Francisco Romeiras from Ericeira Surf Clube points at the waves raking across the mouth of Ribeira d Ilhas a sensational amphitheatre of a beach with sheer golden cliffs cupping the Atlantic It s a long point break breaking on the right he says drawing on a lexicon unique to boardriders This wave its consistency the way it delivers in all tides it s what drew the first surfers to Ericeira back in the early Ready to give it a try I m relieved I m not directed towards the distant figures carving shapes out in the deep water Instead I spend an hour with Francisco finding my feet nearer the shore Don t overthink it he reminds me as a small wave catches my board and I discover I m travelling with the ocean at what feels like break neck speed Knees bent Eyes on the beach he shouts as for the first time I successfully launch from belly to feet before eventually toppling starfish limbed into the shallows When we pad out of the surf an hour later Francisco draws my attention to a promontory marked by a silver statue of a surfer The Guardian was created by José Queiroz in as a clarion call for environmental protection and preservation It s become the unofficial symbol of Ericeira as the town continues to settle into its status as a World Surfing Reserve The designation awarded in by Save the Waves Coalition celebrates the culture economy and environment of outstanding surf locations and Ericeira was the second place in the world after Malibu California to be recognised It really put us on the map Francisco says In May a location was enshrined that delighted British surfers North Devon As we store away our boards I m introduced to Ulisses Reis a veteran of the scene I was one of the first people teaching here There was just a basic surf camp on the beach a place for hippies to hang out he tells me momentarily lost in his memories But it was demolished Today there s a sleek boardwalk with wood slatted surf shacks showers and a cafe The complex is home to Ulisses surf school Blue Ocean from where his sons now give lessons It s also one of over in Ericeira I worry about the commercialisation of surfing here how fast things are changing This is all great he says gesturing around it s my whole life now But personally I preferred it before Ericeira on Portugal s Atlantic Coast offers year round surf conditions with May to September serving up gentler swells suitable for beginners October November and April can also be good months to learn but the waves in the winter months are best left to the pros Photograph by Rricardo Rocha Getty If there s tension in the community over the rising tide of travellers it s impossible to feel it as I explore the white washed lanes of the historic centre later that day Surf shops upmarket clothing boutiques and cafes serving poke bowls fit alongside timewarp tavernas and bakeries selling ouriços local almond cakes I discover houses inlaid with antique tiles petitioning saints against maritime disasters and modern street art filled with surfing motifs The sport may be a relatively new phenomenon in this traditional fishing community founded in but it s already woven into the very fabric and driving the local economy It s hard being a fisherman The tides the conditions The older men are glad their sons can work in surf tourism for a good life and still live off the sea says Ana Vaz from the region s tourism bureau the next day We re touring Ericeira s interpretation centre just off the main square Inside an interactive model of the mile coastline explains its seven distinct wave formations Along with Ribeira d Ilhas there s Pedra Branca and Reef both found off Empa Beach Crazy Left Coxos and Cave near Dois Irmãos Bay and São Lourenço a fast wave rising off a rocky plateau some metres out from the beach I finally begin to understand the geographical factors at play in creating conditions for surfing and get a sense too of the culture and marine ecosystem locals are keen to preserve Ericeira is no stranger to visitors It was founded by seafarers and its mineral rich waters were discovered by travellers centuries ago even before Vila Galé hotel was built Ana says referencing the palatial local icon built in Since the start of the pandemic record numbers of digital nomads have also made Ericeira their temporary home The challenge is balancing the needs of new visitors with those of the residents and encouraging travellers to explore beyond the World Surfing Reserve There s so much to do if you look inland too Ericeira continues to carefully manage the changes brought by increased surf tourism The town retains the charm of a historic fishing village with its white washed Old Town home to centuries old chapels and houses Photograph by Alexander Sorokopud Alamy Taking this as a challenge I plot a path into the department of Mafra I pass rolling green pastures peppered with lemon farms small communities like that of Sobreiro home to the quaint model village of sculptor José Franco and family run vineyards such as Quinta de Sant Ana At the heart of the region is the sumptuous Palace of Mafra Built by King João V in the century the baroque edifice is buttressed by a basilica convent and the acre walled Tapada hunting grounds It s in the hilltop honeypot of Sintra to the south that I try my hand at another sport The flowering town with its old fortresses and crooked alleyways needs little introduction century poet Lord Byron is among the many British travellers to have fallen for its charms describing it as a glorious Eden But few visitors would guess that the granite mountain slabs stacked beneath the western ramparts of the century Moorish Castle offer some of the best rock climbing in the country You have to trust In your feet your equipment your mind says Luis Batista a climbing instructor from adventure sports company Desnivel as he tightens my harness It ll be worth it for the view We crane our necks at the high mass of stone rising from the forested path This is Penedo da Amizade the largest cliff face in Sintra with a purported different near vertical paths of ascent Luis gets me started on an easy grade III which he first models nimbly demonstrating how to grip onto sheer surfaces and leverage body weight to climb As with surfing my first attempts aren t steady or dignified and fear mixes queasily with resolve But on my third ascent something clicks I trust my feet I reach higher I find purchase where none could be found before and I make it to the top The western coast of Portugal is laid out below me like a map land unfurling towards a binary expanse of ocean and sky The past week has seen me exploring both of these unlikely domains learning new skills and gaining new perspectives alongside experts who ve made riding waves and scaling lofty heights the focus of their lives I take a moment to drink in the scene the tiny turreted pleasure palaces of Sintra dotted below and the gulls gliding by on balmy thermals But only for a moment Luis is calling out and it s time to come back down to earth The granite slabs beneath Sintra s lofty Moorish castle are well know to local climbing enthusiasts The hight Penedo da Amizade is the largest cliff face in Sintra offering different paths of ascent Photograph by António Almeida Naturway How
