preserve St Helena s wild landscapes for generations to come This remote island in the South Atlantic is home to hundreds of endemic species rich marine biodiversity and fascinating history Helena Bennett director of the St Helena National Trust shares how she aims to commemorate the island s past while protecting its future Helena Bennett director of the St Helena National Trust explains how her team is working to preserve the island s natural wonders including the cloud forest which is home to more than of St Helena s endemic species Photo by Sophia Joshua By Oliver Berry August Everything about the small island of St Helena seems unlikely It stands isolated in the middle of the South Atlantic halfway between Africa and South America but it s been a British colony for over years The island is mostly made of volcanic rock yet its topography is astonishingly varied ranging from meadows and cloud forest to subtropical valleys filled with wildflowers cacti and succulents And although it covers less than miles roughly the size of Manchester this speck of land is home to endemic species over a third of the total found across all British territories It s also home to Helena Bennett the director of the St Helena National Trust who works to preserve these natural wonders and educate visitors on the island s storied past It s unusual I ll admit that much she says of her role which can encompass everything from conserving heritage buildings to protecting endangered species like the wirebird Jamestown St Helena s historic capital is sandwiched between the steep cliffs of James Valley Photo by Craig Williams Like most St Helenians or Saints as they prefer to be called Helena s family history illustrates the island s tangled past St Helena is a melting pot Most islanders have at least different DNA markers Helena explains On my maternal side we traced our family tree back to and the Bennetts in Lancaster who came as part of the whaling industry On my paternal side of my DNA is from Southern India so they were probably workers for the East India Company We discovered comes from Congo or Cameroon so that s the slave trade A single person is a living piece of the island s history To me that s fascinating Facing the past In recent years the island has reckoned with some of the more uncomfortable aspects of its past Between and the British Navy intercepted slave ships en route from Africa to the Americas in an attempt to eliminate the illegal transatlantic trade More than Africans liberated from these ships were brought to St Helena Most were later taken back to Africa or on to other countries but around a third of those settled on the island and were eventually buried in Rupert s Valley a rocky ravine a few miles from the capital Jamestown In when the island s airport was being built the remains of people were exhumed and reburied in a new cemetery Work is currently underway to build an education centre and memorial to help tell their story The National Trust offers guided tours of Rupert s Valley to help visitors gain a deeper understanding of St Helena s role in the abolition of the international slave trade The St Helena Museum in Jamestown also provides historical background from ships logs sailors letters and shipwreck artefacts Helena also suggests visitors hike to High Knoll Fort the hilltop citadel that looms high over the capital The views are amazing and I like to imagine what it would ve been like in the or when it would have been this vibrant lively working fort Fresh fish is fried at the seaside

Preserving natural wonders For most travellers it s St Helena s natural splendour that draws them here The island s coastline has been a designated marine reserve since and in it was chosen as a Hope Spot a beacon of marine biodiversity It s been heartwarming to receive that official recognition says Helena She s been particularly encouraged by the response of the island s fisherfolk who after initial reservations have come to embrace the project from implementing fishing quotas to fighting plastic pollution Their efforts have paid off St Helena is rated as one of the best places in the South Atlantic to see marine megafauna such as dolphins green turtles and whale sharks Visitors to St Helena may be lucky enough to spot a whale shark swimming off the island s coast Photograph by Beth Taylor The island s cloud forest which contains more than of St Helena s endemic species including the blushing snail and spiky yellow woodlouse currently faces threats from invasive species and pathogens including a water mould called phytophthora To learn about replanting initiatives that are helping to preserve the island s endangered plants Helena recommends taking a guided walk to Blue Point or Southwest Point From there you can see the cloud forest in all its glory she says Helena has big plans for the National Trust including a renovation project for the island s historic buildings a grasslands restoration programme a cultural centre with space for the island s library and digitised archives and a new research initiative focussing on the island s shark species There s lots of exciting work she says We re doing things here the rest of the world is aspiring to As always we re leading the way even if we re a small island very far away Plan your trip There are weekly
