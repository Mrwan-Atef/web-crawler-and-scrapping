Namibia Renting a vehicle either self drive or with a driver guide is the only way to reach many parts of the country Vehicle rental is straightforward and reasonably priced The roads are generally well maintained Apart from the major north south and east west paved arteries most of Namibiaâ s roads are gravel These are generally well maintained but be aware of steep verges dongas gullies loose rocks slippery braking conditions dust and cattle and wildlife wandering onto the road When planning per hour is considered to be the maximum safe speed on gravel although per hour is often a more realistic estimate Most roads are sparsely traveled and itâ s easy to drive for hours without passing other vehicles While there are fuel stations in all population centers thereâ s generally nothing at all in between Rental vehicles commonly come equipped with an array of useful equipment including tire inflators shovels rooftop tents and sometimes satellite phones However this should be confirmed in advance Getting is recommended as is carrying extra jugs of water Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email
