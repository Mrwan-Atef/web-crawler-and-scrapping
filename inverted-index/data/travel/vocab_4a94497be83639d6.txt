requirements Julia Buckley Mar min read Share Europe s new entry rules will be applied much later than anticipated pictured Venice Italy Kateryna Mukhina Shutterstock Planning a dream trip to Europe Be aware that entering Schengen the border free zone within Europe will be changing but not as soon as previously thought After multiple delays the new entry system EES will be launched in October However the EU s much misunderstood visa waiver program ETIAS is now set to become operational much later in we ve lost count of how many times this has been pushed out but it was originally scheduled to launch in Advertisement Itâ s all pretty technical but is not as complicated as it seems Hereâ s what to know â and how it might impact your trip What is EES The first step on the road to ETIAS is the introduction of the EES biometric entry exit system which will log when non EU citizens enter and exit the Schengen zone allowing the authorities to track overstayers more easily After multiple delays this is currently scheduled to come into force in October The EU has announced it will take a phased approach to implementation rather than an all at once rollout Non EU travelers will have their fingerprints taken and be photographed at the border the first time they cross into Schengen after the roll out To manage initial congestion the EU plans to implement a safety valve system where potentially as few as one in travelers may need to undergo biometric registration in the early weeks and months Denmark is one of the countries in Europe that will require visitors to complete an ETIAS before arrival iStock What is ETIAS ETIAS â which stands for European Travel Information and Authorisation System â is the forthcoming visa waiver system to enter the Schengen area in Europe slated to start operations in the last quarter of Contrary to what many people think this is not a visa â rather itâ s for people whose passport means they donâ t need a visa to enter the EU Think of it as a pre check â itâ s for the authorities to run background checks and pre authorize you to enter the bloc before you travel In essence itâ s just like the ESTA Electronic System for Travel Authorization which was introduced by the US in Also like ESTA itâ s not a guarantee that you can enter the bloc â you still have to comply with entry regulations on the day What s the main difference between EES and ETIAS In short EES just logs your movements ETIAS gives you the right to make those movements Who is impacted Travelers from the countries that currently can enter Europeâ s Schengen area without a visa must apply for ETIAS This includes citizens from the US Canada Brazil Australia and Japan It also applies to European countries that are neither in the EU nor Schengen such as the UK Montenegro Ukraine and Bosnia and Hercegovina Advertisement Thirty European countries will require visitors to sign up for ETIAS â a full list is on the official website and itâ s best to double check your destination since the differences between the EU and Schengen can get a little complicated ETIAS gives visitors the right to enter the EU countries EES tracks their movements Wehnert Shutterstock There are different rules for the EU and Schengen zone Essentially ETIAS applies to the Schengen zone which is not quite the same as the EU Schengen is made up of all but two EU member states Cyprus and Ireland plus four non EU countries Switzerland Iceland Norway and Liechtenstein All of these will require ETIAS Incidentally Cyprus will require ETIAS but Ireland will not So visit Iceland not in the EU and youâ ll need ETIAS but you can go to Ireland without it despite Ireland being in the EU Just to be more complicated neither Cyprus nor Ireland are introducing EES biometric entry exit system border checks EU citizens and documented residents donâ t need to apply for ETIAS Neither do travelers from countries that require a visa to enter Schengen â they still need a visa For more information see the EUâ s official website When does ETIAS take effect While ETIAS was initially planned for the first half of it is now likely to launch at the end of as confirmed by the European Commission It likely won t impact your travel plans until early Visitors wanting to visit Europe in can book their trips but keep an eye out for official annoucements over ETIAS launch dates Maxim Morales Lopez Shutterstock What do travelers need to do now Unless you re super organized and are planning a trip for you can hold your horses â applications for ETIAS are nowhere near open yet so you don t have to think about it at all The EU has confirmed that no action is required from travelers at this point Once they are â and things may change by then â you will have to pay a â US processing fee Make sure you apply through the official EU site not third party websites that will charge an extra fee and may not be so tight on data handling The online application should be a simple form similar to the ESTA In addition to data about yourself and your passport you ll need to give your occupation education level and details of any criminal convictions or travel to war zones Criminal record declarations will cover the past years years for terrorism related offenses Your application will be automatically checked against several security databases including Europol Interpol and a special watchlist for certain individuals If refused you can appeal the decision or apply for a travel authorization with limited territorial validity You ll also need to list the country of your intended stay and address of your first destination However this isn t set in stone â you can change your plans after obtaining the ETIAS if you need according to the EU s website Side note You should go ahead and book your trip now ETIAS has been delayed multiple times so don t wait to receive authorization before buying those flights ETIAS will be valid for three years or until your passport expires â whichever comes first â with unlimited entry and exits As with regular travel to the EU your passport must be under years old and have more than three months validity left Each ETIAS is only valid for one person so families will have to make multiple applications Once EES kicks in visitors will need to give biometic data at the border which means delays are likely Philippe TURPIN Getty Images How will this impact your next trip to Europe Again it s not something you have to consider for a long time And when it does kick in it won t impact your travel plans too much In fact once youâ ve applied having ETIAS authorization shouldnâ t affect your travels at all â since itâ s valid for multiple entries you wonâ t have to reapply or provide destination details for every trip and because it covers Schengen you can border hop without issue The introduction of EES is a different story however Even with the phased approach expect longer processing times at borders The EU has emphasized that attempting to cross borders without ETIAS could have serious consequences including denial of entry to the Schengen member country Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For
