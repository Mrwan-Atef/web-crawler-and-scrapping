read Share A fisherman moors his boat just off the pristine sands of BahÃ a de Las Ã guilas Matt Munro for Lonely Planet According to its tourism slogan the Dominican Republic â has it all â And thatâ s no exaggeration The island nation is home to eight different terrestrial ecosystems and hundreds of kilometers of enviable coastline that include both the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea Thatâ s a lot of beaches to explore Thanks to all of that biodiversity each one of those glorious stretches of sand has its own distinct attraction suited for just about any adventure that tickles your fancy That might mean surfing sand dunes along a wind whipped coast watching a leatherback turtle make its way through azure waters or peacefully soaking up the sun on a patch of sugary white sand Thereâ s really no wrong answer â just not enough bathing suits These are eight of the best beaches in the Dominican Republic BahÃ a de las Ã guilas Best beach for quiet reflection Advertisement BahÃ a de Las Ã guilas is a strong contender for the â Most Beautiful Beachâ superlative category Itâ s tucked into the Jaragua Nature Preserve and requires a boat from Cabo Rojo to reach its five mile long shore But it s well worth the effort as being tucked inside the preserve makes this beach blissfully quiet and stunningly pristine the sand untouched by waste and the waters crystal clear Planning tip The boat ride from Cabo Rojo to BahÃ a de Las Ã guilas is US and departs at regular intervals You can also opt for a tour that includes the cost of the boat ride to the site Sun loungers line the sand along Cayo Levantado s perfect beach Images iStockphoto Cayo Levantado Best beach for paddleboarding Over on the eastern coast of the Dominican Republic is the small island retreat of Cayo Levantado This picturesque paradise sits amidst the whale watching waters off the coast of SamanÃ although two thirds of the island is owned by a luxury resort The other third though is open to the public and visitors flock here to swim sunbathe and listen to bachata rhythms in between sips of piÃ a coladas from the colorful bars dotting the beach Planning tip Boat taxis to Cayo Levantado depart regularly from SamanÃ port on Avenida Marina If youâ re lucky you might spot a leatherback turtle making its way through the turquoise waters A surfer walks across the dark sandy beach at Encuentro Lila Koan Shutterstock Playa Encuentro Best beach for surfers Advertisement Surfâ s up at this bohemian little beach spot between the northern towns of Cabarate and SosÃºa To get to the shore youâ ll have to pass through a tropical woodland where colorful shacks sell souvenirs and snacks Once you make it past the treeline the Atlantic Ocean unfolds before you with its rollicking waters Rows of surfers bob along on the water waiting for the next wave to take them to shore The water can be rough so stick to the shallows unless you re an experienced surfer or taking a lesson with a guide Local tip There are plenty of shacks along the shore offering surfing lessons to novices Itâ s one of the better ways to get a taste of what Encuentro has to offer The sky above Kite Beach filled with colorful kites as boarders head to the water Andrey Prokhorov Kite Beach Best beach for kiteboarding Near Encuentro youâ ll find a beach dedicated to a different kind of adventure sport Kiteboarders from around the world flock to Kite Beach so they can catch powerful gusts of wind that propel them into the air Watching their aerial acrobatics is a good time in and of itself but if you get the itch to try your hand at kiteboarding lessons are offered by various companies around Cabarete The rolling dunes at Dunas de Bani are perfect for sandboarding Alex Po Travel Shutterstock Dunas de Bani Best beach for sandboarding The sand dunes in Bani feel like a desolate Saharan oasis â itâ s unlike any beach youâ ll ever encounter which is what makes it worth a stop The sloping sand dunes crest up to high and are dotted with olive trees goats and the occasional visitor surfing the dunes Once you make it past the minute trek through the sandy hills youâ ll find the rough currents of Bahia de Las Calderas Desolate and wild the beach here feels private and untamed Swimming isnâ t advised but collecting the glossy pieces of quartz tumbling around the shore is Local tip People often leave their wooden planks and boards on the dunes for others to surf on but you can also pick up a board from one of the shops in the town of Bani A stretch of Playa BÃ varo dotted with loungers and palm trees with clear blue waters beyond Anastasia Petrosyan Shutterstock Playa BÃ varo Best beach for families Clocking in at miles of coastline Playa BÃ varo is one of the longest stretches of shore in the Caribbean and provides beach access for most of the resorts of Punta Cana That means quite a few pockets of the sand are off limits to non guests but you can still find publicly accessible entrances filled with families building sand castles dancing to bachata rhythms and enjoying picnics in the sand The calm turquoise waters are ideal for swimming and splashing about Planning tip Cortecito and Los Corales beaches offer public access to the BÃ varo shores The pristine white sand crescent of Playa San Rafael backed by dense forest Matt Munro for Lonely Planet Playa San Rafael Best natural pools with a view Itâ s hard to believe but taking a dip in San Rafael feels more akin to an ice plunge than a warm bath Here the Caribbean Sea meets the crisp waters of the San Rafael River which thunder down in a series of waterfalls from the chilly Sierra de Bahoruco mountain tops The actual waters of the beach are too rough to swim in but the natural pools that form just as the river meets the sea are perfect for casually sitting around and cooling off on a warm day Local tip Try some of the coastal Dominican fare from the various shacks situated around the natural pools Youâ ll find fresh caught fish fried plantains and rice available for lunch The towering granite cliffs behind Playa Pavel Prodan Shutterstock Playa Best beach for snorkeling and scuba diving A minute boat trip from the sleepy coastal town of Las Galeras Playa feels like an unspoiled paradise Emerald green waters lap against a black granite rock formation while towering coconut palms sway in the breeze The labyrinth like reefs beneath the surface are teeming with fish and sting rays â the perfect spot to bring your mask and spend a few hours snorkeling or scuba diving in Playa s warm waters Planning tip Las Galerias is about a two hour drive from Las Terrenas a vibrant ex pat hang with cafes and restaurants dishing up a variety of international cuisines and some of the best food on the island Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Dominican Republic Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers
