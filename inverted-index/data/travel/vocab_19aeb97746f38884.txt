Islands Alexis Averbuck Apr min read Share A boat cruises past the island fortress of Bourtzi in the harbor of Nafplio Greece Aerial motion Shutterstock Who hasnâ t dreamed of going to Greece The fabled country inspires travelers with its peerless culture and art food outdoor adventures and of course beaches and islands And since any trip goes a little better with a little planning weâ ve put together a list of ideas we think any traveler would benefit from knowing From when and were to book to local etiquette to health and safety issues once youâ re there hereâ s everything you need to know to plan a memorable trip to Greece Investigate whether you need a visa or not Greece a European Union member lies within the Schengen Zone which allows its citizens to travel among states all but four within the EU without a visa Beyond this zone citizens of more than countries are permitted to travel to Greece visa free for a total of days within a day period Greeceâ s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the full list If youâ re a citizen of a country not on the list youâ ll have to apply for a Schengen visa Hereâ s where to learn more about visa requirements to Greece Advertisement Metsovo in northwestern Greece in winter The country isnâ t all sun kissed islands Apostolos Mantzouranis Shutterstock Consider the pros and cons of each season Your experience in Greece will be wildly different depending on when you visit Summer is tops for action family fun and swimming in the Mediterranean Sea â but prices are at their highest and booking ahead for everything is a must since itâ s all so popular The shoulder seasons spring and autumn are a delight with lower prices and rooms and resources less in demand Winter offers a moody and budget friendly retreat great for walking hiking and low key exploring you will often be the only visitor around Bear in mind that some businesses will shut down completely during the low season Focus on the right island or region for you Greece merits multiple trips as every island offers something different and each of its regions is equally dazzling Youâ re never going to see everything on your first visit and youâ ll ruin your trip if you pressure yourself to do just that While during a longer trip days or two weeks say you can cover many not to be missed highlights all over Greece weâ d recommend thinking through your travel wishes and priorities as you plan Consider homing in on two or three islands or even just one or a single rich region like the Peloponnese Or read up on canâ t miss ancient sites and craft an itinerary that will bring Greeceâ s stunningly rich history to life And donâ t be fooled that the biggies are the only islands worthy of your attention Though Mykonos Santorini and other famous places have plenty to offer lesser known islands there are hundreds like Amorgos or Kythira are also a delight Theyâ ve also got the added bonus of smaller crowds and lower prices People dining at outdoor cafes in summer in Plaka Athens Greece Shutterstock In peak season book well ahead During the peak weeks of July and August prices are high and demand for car rentals accommodations and ferry tickets is even higher Simply put this is not the time for ad hoc bookings on the fly Greece is an incredibly popular summer destination and the best options get snapped up well in advance Pack the right kinds of clothing Youâ ll find that Athenians are well dressed and the younger crowd trendy â so keep your smart clothes for the urban catwalk of clubs and bars Even so in Athens and other metropolises such as Rhodes Thessaloniki and Iraklio everyday attire such as shorts or jeans and casual tops is just fine Advertisement Bars or fashionable restaurants require more effort with a scene thatâ s stylish rather than dressy think tops and trousers rather than t shirts and cut offs In more out of the way places you can wear casual clothing And in summer the heat will make you want to wear the least amount of fabric you can get away with â so you wonâ t regret packing quick drying tank tops and cool dresses Sturdy walking shoes are a must for the cobbled roads and proper hiking boots are key if youâ re exploring the countryside on foot Wherever you find yourself in the country itâ s respectful to cover up before entering churches Athens isnâ t the only gateway to Greece Many travelers transit in or out of Greece via Athens as its airport has connections with numerous international destinations and the city itself is a gem Yet other airports on the Greek mainland such as in Thessaloniki and on some major islands such as Mykonos Santorini and Corfu also offer international connections If you need any internal flights to get to your destination of choice itâ s worth pricing out these legs one by one Due to government subsidies you might see significant savings by booking each part of your intra Greek itinerary separately from your international flights A car near the coast of Karpathos Dodecanese Greece Pawel Kazmierczak Shutterstock You need confidence to take to Greeceâ s roads No one who has dodged crazed drivers on Greeceâ s roads will be surprised to hear that Greeceâ s road fatality rate is one of the highest in Europe with reckless passing listed as the greatest cause of accidents If you can keep your cool during the inevitable heart stopping moments having your own car is a great way to explore off the beaten track Yet you will need to be confident in your driving and keep a few key points in mind The road network has improved enormously in recent years many roads marked as dirt tracks on older maps have now been paved and a lot of the islands have very little traffic Regular if costly car ferry services serve almost all islands Greece is not the best place to initiate yourself into motorcycling If youâ re not confident on a motorbike we suggest parking this option until you have more experience All the big multinational car rental companies are represented in Athens and most have branches in major towns and popular tourist destinations The majority of islands have at least one outlet While some progress has been made much of Greece remains unfortunately unfriendly to wheelchair users dmphoto Getty Images Beyond Athens Greece is not very wheelchair friendly Though access for travelers with disabilities has improved somewhat in recent years the majority of Greeceâ s accessible sights hotels and restaurants tend to be located in Athens Much of the rest of Greece remains inaccessible to wheelchairs and the abundance of stones marble pavers slippery cobbles and stepped alleys create frustrating barriers for those with mobility issues People who have visual or hearing impairments are also rarely catered for alas Still careful planning before you set out for Greece can make a world of difference There are specific resources online that provide links to local articles resorts and tour groups catering to tourists with physical disabilities A woman walked past painted houses in Pyrgi Chios Greece tunart Getty Images Learn a few basic Greek phrases Though Greek is a challenging language to learn picking up a few basic greetings and niceties will make a world of difference in how locals receive you In touristed areas many people speak English â so rest assured that you can get by even if youâ re shaky on those Greek phrases Donâ t rely on cards or ATMs â and have euros on you at all times Youâ ll find ATMs in every Greek town large enough to support a bank and in almost all the tourist areas Yet regular travelers know that ATMs on the islands can lose their connection for a day or two at a time making it impossible for anyone locals included to withdraw money Itâ s useful to have some backup cash just in case this happens during your visit consider withdrawing more euros than you need when you visit a working ATM Credit cards are now an accepted part of the commercial scene in Greece although theyâ re often not accepted on many of the smaller islands or in small villages Donâ t rely on your cards alone and verify in advance that the restaurant or bar you have in mind takes them if you feel uncomfortable carrying large amounts of cash In Greek restaurants a service charge is normally included in the bill and while a tip is not expected it is always appreciated Taxi drivers normally expect you to round up the fare while bellhops who help you carry your luggage to your hotel room or stewards on ferries who take you to your cabin normally expect a small gratuity of between â and â Consider buying good travel insurance Although medical training is of a high standard in Greece the public health service is underfunded Hospitals can be overcrowded with relatives expected to bring in food for patients â an obvious problem for solo travelers Conditions and treatment are much better in private hospitals which are expensive All this means that a comprehensive travel insurance policy is essential There is at least one doctor on every island and larger islands have hospitals As in most European countries pharmacists in Greece can usually dispense medicines that are available only by prescription If you have a health situation thatâ s not critical we recommend making a pharmacy your first stop Visitors to the Acropolis Frequent hydration and sunblock are vital when touring Greece in the summer Laurence Berger Shutterstock Stay hydrated and remember the sunâ s strength Tap water isnâ t safe to drink on many islands if in doubt ask Keeping a supply of bottled water to hand is essential for hydration as well as safety Many tourists underestimate how hot it can get in Greece and heatstroke and serious sunburn are common on beaches with little shade Break up your sun sessions with siestas in the shade and frequent water breaks and pack plenty of high SPF sunscreen Even though mosquitos are an irritant rather than a danger in Greece packing insect repellent is recommended Pickpocketing and other petty crime is common in busy places Visitors to Greece need to stay aware of the dangers of pickpockets in the large cities and the theft of belongings when lounging on busy popular beaches always leave passports behind in hotel safes Never leave your belongings unattended and donâ t leave your bags hanging from the back of your seat where you canâ t keep an eye on them A dedicated tourist police force works in tandem with the standard Greek police Each tourist police office has at least one member of staff who speaks English If you need to report a theft or loss of passport go to the tourist police first and they will help you interface with which at a minimum means interpreting for the regular police Some unscrupulous taxi drivers will try to charge you extortionate rates from the airports to the city centers Always make sure the meter is running or pre negotiate and agree on the price before you get in Advertisement
