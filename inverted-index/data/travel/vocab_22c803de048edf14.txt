Nations of these lands the Inuit and the Metis as we host visitors together When it comes to water based getaways tropical beaches get all the glory But one of the most wildly diverse aquatic environments in the world lies far from the Equator where palm trees are replaced by the towering pines and sweet maples that surround more than a quarter million lakes in southeastern Canada s economic hotspot Even its name is lake derived from the eponymous Lake Ontario an adaptation of a word meaning sparkling water from the Haudenosaunee Indigenous Peoples Nearly one fifth of the world s fresh water can be found in the province perhaps unsurprising given that four of the five Great Lakes serve as the province s borders And while they are great Lake Superior as the largest of any freshwater lake in the world by surface area even has its own tide Ontario is as dynamic as its environs a land of both industry and conservation society and solitude And so too are its lakes From any

international border and on the southern end of the UNESCO recognized Rideau Canal where the waters were once favored by pirates and filled with Prohibition era contraband Today though due to the
