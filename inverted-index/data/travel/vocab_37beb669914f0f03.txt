The path to Italy s past runs through its ancient monasteries TRAVEL The path to Italy s past runs through its ancient monasteries Across the Italian countryside sacred religious spots are offering tranquility to a new generation of travelers The Sacra di San Michele an abbey perched atop Mount Pirchiriano has become one of Italy s many sanctuaries and monasteries that welcome visitors for tours and daytime visits By Julia Buckley Photographs by Andrea Frazzetta December David Gagrčić first set eyes on the Italian sanctuary of La Verna on a school trip in Raised in Croatia to an Italo Croatian family Gagrčić was just years old at the time but it was there at this friary nestled in the mountains of Tuscany that his life changed forever It filled my heart he says The scent of the wood inside has always stayed with me God spoke to me Gagrčić felt a calling inspired by La Verna He took vows as a Franciscan friar and spent a year in training at the sanctuary in After two decades of postings to friaries around Tuscany and a year in Jerusalem he returned to the mountain as Brother David a Franciscan friar and vicar of La Verna Founded by early followers of St Francis in the sanctuary is one of hundreds of monasteries and friaries in Italy open to the public These monasteries are often part of the cenobitic tradition based on the concept of life in common But as these ancient Christian communities work to stay relevant in the modern world their traditions are also evolving The buildings and sites overseen by those like Gagrčić are now destinations themselves welcoming travelers of all religious backgrounds seeking the serenity of Italy s countryside and mountains away from the bustling urban tourist hubs For almost centuries monasteries friaries and sanctuaries have welcomed visitors to worship eat stay the night or simply enjoy the views The practice dates back to the medieval period when Italy was the home of countless hermits and groups of monaci monks and frati brothers or friars who sought God through community Medieval monasteries regularly hosted overnight guests providing a safe place to stay for all St Benedict said to welcome guests as Christ himself says Dom Maurizio Vivera prior of the Sanctuary of the Sacro Speco holy cave a monastery grafted to the rock face in the central mountains of Lazio where the saint lived as a hermit in the early sixth century St Benedict s directive Vivera adds applies to everyone including people who come to the monastery solely for the beauty He said that a hello isn t enough you have to give them everything you can That became the cardinal point of the Benedictine order The ancient library of Tuscany s La Verna sanctuary is home to over printed volumes However their use is reserved for resident friars Visitors looking for contemplation art and food can drive hike and in the case of La Verna even snowshoe toward an encounter with modern spirituality Found in Tuscany s National Park of the Casentinesi Forests Mount Falterona and Campigna La Verna welcomes around visitors each year Gagrčić estimates and is indelibly linked to St Francis who was gifted this mountain as a place of retreat by a noble in The saint would come to the area to roam the mountain meditating in caves and on rocks It is where in he is said to have received the stigmata the wounds of Christ s Crucifixion marked on his hands feet and side The centuries roll back on the seven minute stroll from the parking area as rippling mountains furred with a thick canopy of silver firs and beeches glisten in gold each fall By the time visitors reach the monastery which clings to the cliffside the abyss falling beneath it it s as if they have arrived in the century when Francis s followers started construction after his death Descending the cliff down precipitous steps visitors will reach a liminal space of moss slicked boulders among the same that Francis communed with in the He is said to have preferred one rock cleaved down the middle an echo of the heavens rending when Christ died on the Cross to pray on For Gagrčić this area not the monastery above is La Verna s true sanctuary At the hermitage of Santa Maria infra Saxa a nearly year old octagonal chapel the Temple of Valadier was built into a cliffside cave in the Marche region Many come in search of something spiritual in a generic sense there are a lot of people looking for something he says At La Verna says Gagrčić our mission is moving from the church to the guesthouse Once the monastery gates close for the evening amid the hoots of owls and the songs of birds beloved by St Francis overnight guests can connect with their own version of the divine The Casentinesi Forests are often dubbed the Sacred

throughout the day The first time I came here I was astonished by the beauty the richness of the art and the presence of these men who lived in this very particular style says Father Andrea There are

student A lapsed Catholic Busillo nonetheless found a special energy on the grounds For the first time Sodoma s paintings weren t a picture on a page I saw everything surrounded by the landscape in which he painted them he says You pass through a wood cypresses and when you emerge your soul spirit whatever you believe in becomes more relaxed You can have a kind of reconciliation with your soul
