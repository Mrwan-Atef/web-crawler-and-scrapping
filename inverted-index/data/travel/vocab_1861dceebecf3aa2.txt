Overnight trains let you cross this vast country the way Kazakhs do Â Â Quetin BoÃ hm Alternating between steppes that lead dreamers into the wild and bustling flashy cities like Astana and Almaty Kazakhstan is a country that always has something new to reveal Advertisement The distances are enormous in the ninth largest country on Earth â and the transport options numerous Count on a mix of trains cars buses and even horses to take in the vast and varied landscapes here Kazakhstan is one of the best countries to visit next year See our full list of Best in Travel winners This isnâ t a country made for walking Taxis or public transport will whisk you all over cities such as Astana Â Vladimir Tretyakov Shutterstock In urban centers opt for public transport or taxis Cities like Astana and Almaty as well as Aktau Aktobe and Shymkent have reliable city bus networks In the current and former capital such buses have liveries that easily mark them as public transport In Almaty you can swipe a prepaid transport card and enjoy a tenge fare vs tenge for paying in cash A one month transport pass for tenge will get you unlimited rides on buses and the cityâ s small metro Though quite beautiful the single line metro is more useful to local commuters than tourists as it serves the center but not the south of the city where many restaurants and hotels are located Advertisement In smaller cities as well as on the outskirts of the bigger ones youâ ll also find marshrutkas private minibuses seating between and people that run on a less reliable schedule than their official counterparts Donâ t shy away from a marshrutka ride â although do be prepared to be subjected to the driverâ s personal taste in music and try to avoid the seats in the back half of the bus which are over the wheels and have reduced leg space If you need to get somewhere fast take a taxi or book a car with Yandex a Central Asian rideshare app If you donâ t speak Kazakh or Russian you wonâ t need to worry about explaining where you want to go and the price payable by cash or card is fixed before booking Popular journeys such to and from the airport a border crossing a ski town or a well known tourist destination feature fixed prices In Astana expect to pay tenge for a ride to the airport in Almaty tenge To reach the ski town of Shymbulak from Almaty youâ ll pay about tenge each way Reserve in advance to secure a coveted bottom bunk on Kazakhstanâ s night trains Â Quentin BoÃ hm For the long hauls take a train Kazakhstan s swaths of steppe are best appreciated from the window of a train All the countryâ s major cities offer rail connections with the night trains a particularly fun experience The train stock ranges from vintage to relatively modern and itâ s possible to check which model train youâ ll be taking when you book online using the official booking website Around holidays like Nauryz or in the high summer season itâ s best to book a week or so in advance Tip for night trains Seats on the bottom bunk of sleeper trains are usually booked more than a week in advance Travelers seek them out because you can both sleep and sit upright in these bunks Plus they offer easier access to the common baggage storage just underneath Donâ t count out intercity or even international buses For short rides between cities such as between Astana and Karaganda grab a marshrutka But a coach can now get you even farther â much farther â with comfortable large buses now connecting Almaty with Bishkek and sleeper buses between Almaty and Ã capital of Xinjiang China Visa rules for China have been relaxed recently allowing many passport holders to enjoy a two week visa free stay in China Kazakhstan makes for a perfect stop on this long haul overland route Tip for taking buses Do marshrutkas have a set timetable Some do and some donâ t depending on supply and demand Some destinations have only a few buses a day others have multiple per hour which depart once theyâ re full To find the most accurate times for specific marshrutkas head to the bus station Swing by the station the night before to confirm the departure time for any long haul bus Private marshrutka minibuses travel high into the mountains Â Shutterstock In the wild rely on four wheels â or four hooves The wild emptiness of the Kazakh steppe or the far corners of the Altai Mountains cannot be reached by public transport Renting a car is best done through a local travel agency and if youâ ve decided to drive yourself â likely to go somewhere truly remote like the Ustyurt Plateau â be sure to rent something appropriate namely a If you arenâ t sure youâ ll be able to tackle the route consider hiring a driver with a car A starting price point per day for a driver will be around tenge â but be aware youâ ll also need to pay for your driverâ s food and lodging if you set out on a multiple day trip To reach remote and lush corners of the mountains especially near Almaty but also in the Altai range to the east or to visit the Aksu Zhabagly Nature Reserve near Shymkent prepare to saddle up The Kazakh are proud horsemen and will take you out for the ride of your life Plan about at least tenge per day for a horse to ride along with a guide on horseback Rides usually come as part of a package that includes guesthouse stays transport and meals and which start at tenge per day Accessible transportation in Kazakhstan Public transport in Kazakhstan is not the most comfortable option for travelers with disabilities train corridors donâ t fit a wheelchair and buses are also not equipped with lifts Some trains offer two person carriages at a supplemental cost for extra privacy or space Buses especially marshrutkas can be crowded and hot For travelers who need accommodation outside the services offered the best bet is to organize private transport in cities through Yandex or with a private driver for longer hauls Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers
