Limón Las Terrenas Dominican Republic Caribbean Las Terrenas Login Save Tucked away in surprisingly rough landscape surrounded by peaks covered in lush greenery is the high El Limón waterfall A beautiful swimming hole at the bottom can be a perfect spot to wash off the sweat and mud from the trip here though it s often too deep and cold for a dip The departure point is the small town of El Limón only half an hour from Las Terrenas Just about everyone who visits does so on horseback and almost a dozen paradas horseback riding operations in town and on the highway toward Samaná offer tours try Santí or Parada la Manzana Don t hire someone off the street as there s little difference in price and the service is consistently substandard All outfits offer essentially the same thing a to minute ride up the hill to the waterfalls to minutes to take a dip and enjoy the scene and a to minute return trip with lunch at the end Your guide whom you should tip will be walking not riding which can feel a little weird but is the custom Walking or on horseback you will get wet as there are several river crossings along the way rubber sandals are a good idea If you book with a tour company in Las Terrenas check if transportation to from El Limón is included if not factor on RD round trip by gua gua local bus or US by taxi Typically the tour horse guide and lunch costs per person from US to US try Casa de las Terrenas or Flora Tours Otherwise it s a minimum minute walk from the main intersection in El Limón it s roughly up a sometimes very steep trail over rough terrain and with a river or two to ford It s not difficult to follow the path once you find it though especially if there are groups out on the trail If you make the trip independently you ll need to pay the
