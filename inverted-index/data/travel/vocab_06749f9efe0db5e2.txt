Planet returns to Berlin this July Juan Martinez May min read Share The successor to Berlinâ s legendary Love Parade Rave the Planet returns for its second outing this July Â Omer Messinger Getty Images Calling all techno fans Rave the Planet Berlin was an absolute hit â and the edition promises to be even bigger better and wilder than last yearâ s extravaganza Advertisement Last July Berlin party people finally got the event they had been waiting for more than a decade after a year hiatus the legendary Love Parade returned under the name â Rave the Planet â Over partygoers took to the cityâ s streets to celebrate â peace joy and pancakes â The spirit of the Love Parade had returned with a fresh spin The event was filled with music drinks and an overall incredible atmosphere including a strong advocacy for electronic music culture Powerful speeches covered such topics as the status electronic music deserves the idea of universal basic income for artists and cultural workers the abolition of dancing bans and the introduction of a public holiday to celebrate electronic music Weâ re on board In the end some DJs from around the world led by Berlin legend Dr Motte played their best tracks on the floats â trucks pulling trailers outfitted with turntables and speakers â that made their way across the city Since last yearâ s Rave the Planet was such a smash the event will return on July with a new lineup of artists thousands of techno fans and endless amounts of positive energy All of which is definitely worth planning a trip to Berlin for this summer Techno music exuberant crowds and positive energy about at Rave the Planet Â Christian Ender Getty Images What to expect at Rave the Planet With the motto â music is the answerâ and a mission to protect and preserve electronic dance music culture its organizers say Rave the Planet is a demonstration rather than a mere music festival In the best spirit of techno music the event will be open and free for everyone regardless of nationality religion gender social background or other characteristics Advertisement The parade will begin at on July at the UhlandstraÃ e U Bahn station then wind its way through the streets to the iconic Brandenburg Gate before ending around at the Victory Column SiegessÃ ule While the official lineup has yet to be released the final floats have been confirmed and at least DJs â including Alan Oldham aka DJ T Richie Blacker and Kaiserdisco â will perform throughout the day Speeches will also be delivered from various floats throughout the event and the organizers expect around people total to participate in the parade Hundreds of thousands are expected to participate in the Rave the Planet the successor to the Love Parade Â Sean Gallup Getty Images When and where to see the Rave the Planet parade this year Although the official stops speeches and lineup have not yet been released the parade timings are expected to remain the same as last year as follows UhlandstraÃ e Breitscheidplatz Wittenbergplatz Nollendorfplatz Potsdamer StraÃ e SchÃ neberger Ufer Potsdamer Platz Brandenburger Tor Victory Column Whether youâ re wearing glitter shorts steampunk goggles or fluorescent jumpsuits you can come as you like and arrive or leave whenever you want Since Rave the Planet is a nonprofit event you can also make a donation to support the cause Those who

the Planet to be a part of it Come as you are to Rave the Planet Â Paul Zinken picture alliance via Getty Images Things to keep in mind when attending Rave the Planet If youâ re visiting Berlin for Rave the Planet we recommend arriving early to the event to have enough time to explore and choose which music float youâ d like to follow The Rave the Planet Twitter account is a great resource for finding the latest updates on the parade Each float will play a different sub genre of electronic music so you can either research in advance which float youâ d like to follow or join the vibe that appeals to you on the spot Keep in mind that hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend and the parade is constantly on the move Itâ s a smart idea to meet up with your friends at an U Bahn station beforehand as phone network coverage might be patchy during the parade Going alone No problem the atmosphere is very welcoming and youâ ll feel part of a large community of dancers and ravers Since drinks and food can be tricky to obtain while on the move itâ s a good idea to bring a backpack full of drinks and snacks Although there are many spÃ ti convenience stores supermarkets and food stands along the parade route lines can be long having your own supplies will be useful If you arrive late check when the speeches will take place take the metro to the closest U Bahn station â then follow the music Though Rave the Planet will end at you shouldnâ t worry after parties will take place all around the SiegesÃ ule as well as in Berlinâ s famous clubs See whatâ s happening at the cityâ s iconic techno clubs like Salon zur wilden Renate Tresor or Sisyphos â or attend one of the official after parties produced by the Rave the Planet team Advertisement Advertisement
