Teton and Yellowstone National Parks on this road trip Lonely Planet Editors Mar min read Share The drive along Teton Park Rd Moonstone Images Getty Images While Wyoming is home to just two of the USA s national parks â Grand Teton and Yellowstone â they make up for their headcount in pristine dramatic landscapes The greatest news of all is that the parks are within miles of one another meaning you can experience both parks grandeur in one nature packed road trip Begin near Grand Teton in Jackson and youâ ll be overwhelmed by the craggy peaks of the Tetons towering above the pristine Snake River Valley Approaching Yellowstone from the south you have a good chance of spotting herds of bison lumbering grizzlies and packs of wolves as you drive past the countryâ s largest alpine lake and countless gushing waterfalls Watch the Rockies unfold on this glorious Wyoming road trip with plenty of wildlife en route Advertisement Start Jackson Wyoming End Yellowstone National Park Duration days Distance miles Best time to go June through September is usually snow free and full of wildlife A herd of elk at the National Elk Refuge Jackson Green Mountain Exposure Shutterstock Start Jackson WY Just south of Grand Teton National Park the rustic haute saloon town of Jackson is much more than a park gateway A destination on its own this world class skier magnet is also a summer stunner with plentiful outdoor activities galleries and a shopping scene that reaches beyond trinketry into the realm of cool boutiques and tailored outdoor gear Donâ t skip the National Museum of Wildlife Art where major works by Remington and Bierstadt offer perspectives on nature that will make your skin prickle Across the street elk herds bison and bighorn sheep congregate in winter at the National Elk Refuge though itâ s mostly a feast for birders in summer Finally take advantage of a foodie scene thatâ s among the best in the West with renowned chefs and an emphasis on local farm raised food The drive Rather than shoot straight north from Jackson on Hwy take Hwy to the Mooseâ Wilson Rd Hwy past Teton Village through the Granite Canyon entrance to Grand Teton National Park fee per car The narrow road is closed to trucks and trailers Grizzly sightings are not uncommon Turn into the Laurance S Rockefeller Preserve miles from Jackson Phelps Lake an easy walk from Laurance S Rockefeller Preserve Aleksandr Kretov Shutterstock Stop Laurance S Rockefeller Preserve In contrast to conventional visitor centers the Laurance S Rockefeller Preserve Center aims to provide a more contemplative experience Sparsely furnished it sets the scene for your foray into nature with inspiring quotes from naturalists etched into the walls and a gorgeous conservation library with titles best enjoyed in the leather armchairs Oil tycoon John D Rockefeller secretly purchased this land â and much of the Snake River Valley â when fears of a massive government land grab made Grand Teton National Park an unpopular idea among avaricious developers and self interested locals He donated it all to the park in the save for this former dude ranch which his son handed over in From here you might take an easy stroll to Phelps Lake Any part of the mile loop is spectacular but a plunge off Jumping Rock at the far end of the lake is thrilling The drive The road ends in miles at Teton Park Rd Ultimately you want to go left but you also have the option of turning right for the Craig Thomas Discovery Visitor Center before backtracking It s home to the Grand Teton National Park Store exhibits and artwork and ranger led programs Moving on in miles turn left for String and Leigh Lake trailheads as well as the scenic one way loop along Jenny Lake that will return you back south a short distance Kayaking and paddleboarding on String Lake Paul Bryan Shutterstock Stop String and Leigh Lakes In Grand Teton the drive by views are so dramatic itâ s hard to keep your eyes on the road Each turnout affords a better photo op than the last â no matter which direction youâ re going Prepare for adventure in Moose where you can rent a canoe or paddleboard and head for String Lake and Leigh Lake trailhead This adventure involves a mellow paddle through rocky String Lake to a short portage to Leigh Lake which opens up considerably Float swim and enjoy views of the craggy peaks from your own beach Better yet reserve a waterfront backcountry campsite These shores also make for a great gentle hike suitable for all ages String Lake trail is a mile round trip on foot The drive Take a left out of the Jenny or String Lake areas to Teton Park Rd As you head miles north the landscape turns from sagebrush to pine forest climbing near densely forested Signal Mt Rd a worthy side trip At the Jackson Lake Junction go right to Oxbow Bend almost immediately after the turn on your right Advertisement Oxbow Bend a scenic river valley overlooked by Mt Moran evabozic Shutterstock Stop Oxbow Bend Located miles east of the Jackson Lake Junction Oxbow Bend is one of the most scenic views in the valley with the stunning backdrop of Mt Moran reflecting off the placid Snake River During many sunsets the banks will be lined with photographers looking for their next masterpiece by nature Families enjoy rafting the mellow section of Snake River that runs through the park with views of sharp snowbound peaks Contact a Jackson outfitter to book a half day trip These wet lowlands are also prime wildlife habitat so bring binoculars Early morning and dusk are ideal for spotting moose elk sandhill cranes ospreys bald eagles trumpeter swans and other birds The drive From Oxbow Bend backtrack toward Jackson Lake Lodge before continuing north for beautiful but slow miles on Hwy past Jackson Lake to Yellowstone After entering Yellowstone National Park the straight road climbs to the Continental Divide At West Thumb junction continue straight This will take you over Craig Pass toward Old Faithful Old Faithful Yellowstone s crowd pleasing geyser Shutterstock Stop Old Faithful Yellowstone National Park Americaâ s first â and arguably its most diverse â national park covers an astounding sq miles You could spend a year here and not see it all Make a quick stop at Grant Village Visitor Center to put the fires that burned one third of the park into perspective before heading west on the loop road to the Old Faithful Visitor Education Center which demystifies geyser plumbing and has predicted times for famous eruptions Spouting some gallons of water over high Old Faithful pleases the crowds roughly every minutes If you just missed a show fill the wait with a mile walk to Observation Hill for an overview of the entire basin Loop back via Solitary Geyser whose sudden bursts come every four to eight minutes before rejoining the boardwalk Another prime viewing spot is the porch of historic Old Faithful Inn Even if youâ re not staying over treat yourself to a cocktail in the cavernous log lobby The drive From Old Faithful overpass itâ s only miles to Madison Junction but these are action packed If driving out and back to loop back to Yellowstone Lake you might consider taking all the easterly right hand turnouts first and following with the west side turnouts while heading south the following day after camping at Madison Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park Busara Shutterstock Stop Grand Prismatic Spring Exploring Geyser Country can take the better part of a day Unlike the wildlife these spurting geysers multihued springs and bubbling mud pots are nearly guaranteed to show up for the picture Leaving Madison Campground backtrack miles south and take Firehole Canyon drive on your right past rhyolite cliffs to Firehole Falls and swimming area Five miles south a pullout offers fine views of the smoking geysers and pools of Midway Geyser Basin to the right and Firehole Lake Basin to the left with bison making it a classic Yellowstone vista One mile on take a right for Fountain Paint Pot a huge pool of plopping goop and assorted geysers Try to stop at Midway Geyser Basin with breathtaking rainbow hued Grand Prismatic Spring â Yellowstoneâ s most photogenic pool If parking is full consider driving south miles to the Fairy Falls trailhead and hiking mile in to a new overlook that gives an elevated view of Grand Prismatic Spring The drive From Grand Prismatic Spring drive south toward Old Faithful The road curves west to climb back over Craig Pass before descending to West Thumb Go left on the shoreline road to Lake Village approximately miles away The iconic Lake Yellowstone Hotel Melissa Kopka Getty Images Stop Yellowstone Lake At above sea level shimmering Yellowstone Lake is the largest high elevation lake in the US Despite having a number of thermal features under it however the temperature remains bitterly cold at F C and not great for swimming Grand Loop Rd hugs the western shore Stop to picnic at Sand Point where itâ s worth taking a short walk to the lagoon and black sand beach looking beyond to the rugged Absaroka Range Continue north and have a rest at the Lake Yellowstone Hotel Lake Village the parkâ s oldest building Enjoy classical concerts and cocktail hour in the sprawling sunroom of this buttercup yellow colonial mansion â you may want to return at the dayâ s end At the intersection Hwy heads east past Fishing Bridge closed to fishing toward Cody over what Theodore Roosevelt once called the most beautiful miles in America but for the time being continue north to Hayden Valley The drive Drive along Yellowstone Lake to Lake Village and miles north to Hayden Valley Bear jams are frequent here drive slowly and stop only at turnouts Bison in Hayden Valley grasslands ChereePhotography Shutterstock Stop Hayden Valley â â Flowing from Yellowstone Lake the Yellowstone River is broad and shallow as it meanders gently through the grasslands of Hayden Valley This is the heart of the Yellowstone Plateau the largest valley in the park and a premier wildlife watching spot A former lake bed the valleyâ s fine silt and clay keeps shrubs and grasses thriving attracting elk by the herd Watch for coyotes springtime grizzlies and bison that turn out in the fall for the largest rut in the country Early morning or near dusk are the best times to spot critters Also check out the mud pots and sulfur pits at Mud Volcano a thermal area miles north of Fishing Bridge Junction Earthquakes in generated enough heat and gases in the mud pots to cook nearby lodgepole pines Follow the mile loop boardwalk to see the sights The drive The road runs for miles north along the Yellowstone River to the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone This is another spot famous for bear jams though the offender is usually bison After the open valley changes to densely forested terrain keep watch for the right hand South Rim Dr with sublime views of the upper and lower falls Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone seen from Artist Point Filip Fuxa Shutterstock Stop Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone Here the Yellowstone River takes a dive over the Upper Falls and Lower Falls before raging through the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone Heading north on Grand Loop Rd take the right hand turn to South Rim Dr A steep descent Uncle Tomâ s Trail offers the best view of both falls though note the trail closes at times due to poor conditions Hop in the car again to continue to Artist Point South Rim Dr Canyon Canyon walls shaded salmon pink chalk white ochre and pale green make this a masterpiece A short mile trail continues here to Point Sublime worth following just to bask in the landscape Returning to the Grand Loop go north and turn right on North Rim Dr a mile one way with overlooks Lookout Point offers the best views of the Lower Falls Hike the steep trail for closer action This is where landscape artist Thomas Moran sketched for his famous canyon painting supposedly weeping over his comparatively poor palette The drive After leaving Lookout Point stay on North Rim Dr which winds to Canyon Village Take a right turn on the Grand Loop to head north here for Dunraven Pass This section is narrow and curvy with huge drops It descends to Tower Roosevelt junction where you can head right east for miles to Lamar Valley Lamar Valley a wildlife watching hot spot Alexey Kamenskiy Shutterstock Stop Lamar Valley Take the winding road to Tower Roosevelt stopping at Washburn Hot Springs Overlook for views of the Yellowstone Caldera On clear days you can even see the Teton range The road climbs Dunraven Pass surrounded by fir and whitebark pines At the Tower Roosevelt junction head east through Lamar Valley Tower Roosevelt a hot spot for wolves bears foxes bison and coyotes Watching a wolf pack stalk and take down an elk in a matter of seconds is truly one of the most powerful sights in the world though without the aid of a spotting scope you may have a hard time following the action Along this road Buffalo Ranch hosts Yellowstone Forever Institute courses with biologist led wildlife watching The wolf watching course is particularly fascinating The drive To continue to Mammoth turn around at Pebble Creek campground and return to Tower Roosevelt From here itâ s miles to Mammoth Hot Springs where thereâ s a visitor center and full services Turn left for parking for the upper and lower terraces of Mammoth Hot Springs Mammoth Hot Springs a continuously active thermal area Shutterstock End Mammoth Hot Springs At over years old Mammoth Hot Springs is North Americaâ s oldest and most volatile continuously active thermal area Here the mountain is actually turning itself inside out depositing dissolved subterranean limestone that builds up in white sculpted ledges There are no geysers here as the limestone substrate dissolves too readily to build up the necessary pressure Take the one way loop around the Upper Terraces for views but itâ s best to park at the Lower Terraces to walk the hourâ s worth of boardwalks so you can descend back to your car End your trip with a dip in the Boiling River a hot spring swimming hole reached via an easy mile footpath from on the eastern side of the road miles north of Mammoth The hot springs here tumble over travertine rocks into the cool Gardner River Though usually crowded soaking here is still a treat Leave the park via the north entrance and Gardiner at the Montana state line This article was adapted from Lonely Planet s Best Road Trips USA Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us
