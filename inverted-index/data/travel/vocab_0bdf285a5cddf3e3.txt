it s possible to plan an itinerary on a budget Â flavijus Getty Images Although Jordan is not generally considered a budget destination it is possible to save money with some insider know how and some tweaks to your itinerary Accommodations guided tours entrance fees and restaurants can add up quickly but our top tips will help you plan the best ways to experience Jordan for less Purchase the Jordan Pass If youâ re planning to be in Jordan for at least three nights and youâ re eligible for a visa on arrival purchase the Jordan Pass Costing the same as the entrance fee to Petra the Jordan Pass includes your visa plus Petraâ s entry fee for one two or three days depending on which pass you choose and admission to about tourist sites across the country Advertisement Score deals in the winter Winters in Jordan are short but they are also cold and wet so the crowds thin out and prices tend to drop from late November to February Youâ ll save money on hotels and tours but youâ ll need to be flexible with your itinerary and expectations â wind rain and sometimes even snow can cause cancellations If youâ re visiting Jordan in the winter pack proper cold weather clothing especially if youâ re planning to hike or stay overnight in Bedouin tents in Wadi Rum Avoid visiting in January if possible as it s typically the wettest and coldest month of the year There are two bright spots to warm things up in the winter the weather is often still pleasant in Aqaba and at the Dead Sea Although the capital is considered an expensive city Amman has plenty of free things to do Â Jennifer Hayes Getty Images Skip the foreign chain hotels Accommodations in Jordan can be pricey Budget friendly options include hostels such as Nomads Hotel with locations in Amman and Petra and Carob Hostel provides affordable no frills options Staying at a hostel also puts you in contact with those in the know about great value options â hostel staff and travelers â who can offer tips help make arrangements for lower cost tours and share experiences and expenses for food and transportation for example if you team up and travel together Ask your hostel or hotel about shuttle or taxi services Some offer airport shuttles while others offer transportation to popular sites such as Petra and many can arrange taxis and tours that may not be advertised Booking locally owned boutique hotels is another way to save on hotel costs The rates are usually lower than chain hotels and sometimes you can negotiate the price if you book in person Enjoy Amman for free A bulging wallet isnâ t required to have a good time in Amman Free activities include a walking tour that starts outside the Pasha Hotel ask at reception visiting a mosque people watching on Rainbow Street or Al Balad and exercising with Running Amman Although the capital is considered an expensive city there are plenty of free things to do in Amman Advertisement Buy alcohol at the airport or have a dry trip Alcohol in Jordan is expensive and on par with prices in cities like Los Angeles Visitors are permitted to purchase one liter of alcohol at duty free shops either in the airport upon arrival or within days of arrival at the Duty Free Shop on Al Abdali Boulevard But if you really want to save money skip the alcohol entirely and embrace a dry no alcohol vacation If you want to save money on food in Jordan pack a reusable cooler bag and stock up on snacks and produce Â mathess Getty Images Eat on the go rather than in a restaurant Jordan has an abundance of fruit and vegetable markets convenience stores and grocery shops so if you want to save money on food pack a reusable cooler bag Stock up on snacks and produce grab some fresh falafel and hummus for a few dinars and either eat in your accommodations or have a picnic in a park or along a hiking trail Any imported food will likely cost more so avoid the familiar brands you can find at home Donâ t forget to grab some Medjool dates â they re grown in Jordan travel well and are high in antioxidants and nutrients If youâ re hankering for a home cooked meal you can have a multi course feast at Galsoumâ s Kitchen a local home in Umm Qais for per person It s more affordable â and arguably more flavorful â than a multi course meal in a restaurant and you have the added experience of meeting a local family Hike with a conservation group Private guided tours can be costly but thrifty travelers donâ t have to miss out on the fun EcoHikers a Jordanian operated environmental organization with the motto â letâ s clean as we hike â offers affordable guided group hikes to locations around the country check its Facebook and Instagram for information on upcoming hikes The starting point is Amman and transportation equipment to participate in trail cleanup and a guide are included Locals and visitors join these hikes so the opportunity to spend time doing something good together and learning about the land culture and one another is priceless You don t need a high end tour to get to Petra Â Kanuman Shutterstock Take a bus to Petra Travel to Petra by JTT bus and save the money youâ d spend on a private driver and guide Routes for the air conditioned buses include Amman to Petra Amman to Aqaba and Aqaba to Wadi Rum The bus company also offers daily tours to popular sites through its tourism program The schedule is available online but it s subject to change â call ahead or visit the JTT office in person to book your ticket Choose the budget Dead Sea experience Rates for resorts at the Dead Sea range from around to per night For a Dead Sea experience without the high price tag book a day pass rather than an overnight stay Plan a day trip from Amman or Madaba â where you can find more affordable hotels and hostels â or make it a stop on your drive from Amman to Petra Wadi Rum or Aqaba Day pass prices vary and can change so call the hotels to shop around for the best deal for your budget The Dead Sea Spa Hotel has one of the lowest rates at about per person and the Holiday Inn Resort Dead Sea will cost you around per person If youâ re traveling solo these day pass rates can save you money but if youâ re traveling with someone else or a group the per person rate adds up â consider booking a lower end hotel and staying over Weekend rates tend to be higher so planning your stay for a weekday can save you money too Make your own souvenirs Book a handicraft activity and get two things for the price of one a fun experience to include on your itinerary and a souvenir to take home Sign up for a basket weaving lesson or a stonemasonry experience in Umm Qais a mosaic making session in Amman an Aqabawi handicraft workshop or a Bedouyat ceramic class in Aqaba Donâ t try to do it all Jordan has so much to do that it can become overwhelming to try and plan the perfect itinerary on a budget Accommodations entrance fees guided tours and transportation between cities can really add up If you want to save money youâ ll need to prune your wish list Focus on two or three of your must dos and make the most of those experiences rather than trying to do it all Daily costs in Jordan Bed in hostel dorm Basic room for two Self catering apartment including Airbnb per night Coffee less than Sandwich Dinner for two Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Jordan
