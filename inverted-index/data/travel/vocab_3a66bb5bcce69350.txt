Brisbane Advertisement Stunning Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast is an easy day trip from Brisbane Â zstock Shutterstock Theme parks surfing and hiking the Gold Coast The Gold Coast might be one of Australiaâ s most misunderstood cities Often pigeonholed as a party town the Goldie hosts more than of pristine sand so as logic would suggest thereâ s far more to this beach city than just the nightclubs of Surfers Paradise In the north thrill seekers can hit the theme parks and families can picnic and play at the waterfront Broadwater Parklands Further south surfers can ride competition waves at Snapper Rocks or anywhere along the coastline really and nature lovers can stomp the tracks in Springbrook National Park Donâ t be fooled into thinking Gold Coasters are as casual about their

national parks youâ ll lay eyes on that turquoise waterâ while Mooloolaba and Caloundra offer quieter alternatives and the latter has an award winning brewery by the beach The Sunshine Coast hinterland trades ocean spray for clean mountain air and Montville and Maleny are two standout locales Montville is an adorable one horse town that peters on a mountain ridge The main street is lined with cafes galleries and shops and the nearby Kondalilla National Park is laced with walking trails and waterfalls Maleny miles south is an equally endearing town that supports a thriving dairy industry Visit Maleny Dairies and Maleny Cheese to sample the regionâ s award winning produce then stop in at the Maleny Botanic Gardens for views over the Glass House Mountains and to see more than
