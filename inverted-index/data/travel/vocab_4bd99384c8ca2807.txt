meal at a campsite Â wilpunt Getty Images Fly to South Africa and take a bus to Namibia Only a handful of airlines fly into Namibia While good deals are sometimes available from Europe Frankfurt Germany is the Namibia hub it often works out cheaper to fly into Johannesburg or Cape Town and then continue by bus or plane into Namibia Intercape has a direct bus between Cape Town and Windhoek and connecting service between Windhoek and Johannesburg with prices starting about US one way If youâ re planning a regional itinerary there are also buses between Johannesburg and Gaborone Botswana where a shuttle goes a few times weekly to Windhoek Flying into Windhoek from either Cape Town or Johannesburg takes only two hours If you book early enough you can get tickets from US one way Travel during the low season December through March marks the wet season in Namibia Once the Christmasâ New Year holidays are over the crowds disappear and many accommodation and tour prices are reduced Rates for lodge accommodation in particular can drop by up to in comparison with in season prices While the wetter months are not ideal for viewing large herds of wildlife they are an excellent time for birding and seeing newborn animals Green wildflower clad landscapes are another highlight and you ll have many areas mostly to yourself Summer rains are typically isolated and brief mainly occurring in the form of heavy afternoon thunderstorms By timing your excursions in the morning youâ ll still be able to get around and can relax and enjoy the welcome rain The main exception to this is in the far north where rains are heavier and some areas can become inaccessible Advertisement Renting a and driving it yourself is cheaper than joining a tour Â Getty Images Self drive your way around the country If youâ re traveling in a group self drive is a safe and economical alternative to a fully guided experience and Namibiaâ s good road network makes it easy A week long scheduled group tour starts at around US per person while a person vehicle outfitted for camping will cost from about US for this same period plus the cost of fuel Fuel costs are currently about US per liter plan on about US per day or more depending on your itinerary Namibia is easy to navigate and clearly signposted Though only about of the roadways are tar the gravel roads are well kept and generally more scenic â some are spectacular Flat tires are the most common driver issue so your vehicle will come with two spares You ll want to make sure you know how to change one before your trip and seriously consider the tire and windscreen insurance offered by rental companies If youâ re traveling solo try out Namibia s shuttle service Born out of the COVID pandemic and the global shortage of rental cars the Gondwana Collection launched a shuttle service called Traveller Transfers It stops at nine different areas of interest the Kalahari Fish River Canyon Sossusvlei Swakopmund Etosha and Damaraland At each designated stop lodges will arrange for pick ups and returns At about US per leg the service offers travelers a reliable affordable safe and more environmentally friendly alternative to self driving The drawback is that you ll need to stay in lodges and tented camps and pay for their excursions But with the rising cost of fuel and high demand for rental cars this option may work out to be more affordable for solo travelers Namibia has a good network of quality campsites Â Cavan Images Getty Images Join a scheduled camping tour Itâ s also possible to join a scheduled guided camping program such as those offered by Chameleon Safaris Durations vary from three to days and start at around US per person They typically include everything apart from drinks and water This is also a great option for solo travelers and those interested in meeting others and sharing experiences Because the logistics are taken care of and food and fuel are included you wonâ t be hit with surprise costs Stay at Namibia s vast network of campgrounds Namibia has an abundance of organized campsites throughout the country which are clean and affordable with good amenities Not only will you save a ton on lodging but it s also an excellent opportunity to meet like minded people exchange stories and travel tips and really get a feel for the countryâ s wild empty spaces and clear night skies The average site costs US or US per person and has shared bathrooms hot showers and fire pits with grills at each spot Some camps even have shops selling food water and other basic provisions Mix it up by staying in budget lodges and self catering apartments Budget lodges are plentiful in Namibia They re located all across the country and are clean some with refreshing pools starting at just US per night for a room with a shared bathroom Self catering apartments and homes average from US per night for the entire place These types of accommodations are ideal for spending a night or two between campsites A nice hot shower and some air conditioning can help you reset and get ready for the next leg of your adventure It s relatively cheap to enter Namibia s national parks at just US per person per day Â paula french Shutterstock Spend your days in Namibiaâ s affordable national parks Namibia s national parks are exceptionally diverse expansive sand dunes vast deserts plunging canyons ancient salt pans and dramatic coastlines While the country currently doesnâ t offer a national park pass entry fees are nominal The government has added a small conservation fee to each park bringing the total to about US per person per day at most parks Children aged eight and below enter parks for free Stock up on groceries at the beginning of your trip Namibia s roads offer few opportunities to stop for a bite until you reach your destination so itâ s essential to shop for necessities like snacks and water before you head out Some self drive vehicles are equipped with a small refrigerator allowing you to stock up and save on more than just the basics If you re camping or staying in an apartment you ll have everything you need to prepare your own meal upon arrival instead of going to a restaurant in town saving time and money Braai barbecue facilities are everywhere and sitting under the stars with dinner grilling nearby is a fabulous Namibian experience Take advantage of child and pensioner discounts Childrenâ s generally and under and pensionersâ discounts for those years of age and older are available almost everywhere in Namibia for accommodation and entry fees so always ask if these categories apply to you Some places also offer student discounts Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your
