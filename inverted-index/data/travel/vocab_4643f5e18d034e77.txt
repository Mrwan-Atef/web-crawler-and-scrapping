Phuket from Krabi to Ko Samui to Railay pictured here are the best beaches in Thailand Pierre Lepretre Getty Images White sand turquoise waters and palm trees are high priorities for just about every visitor to Thailand And for just about every visitor the country delivers In fact in a country with over miles of coastline and some islands you can expect to find a lot of postcard perfect beaches Yet you shouldnâ t just count on lying out on them though thatâ s just fine too â since many of these sandy areas also offer activities such as snorkeling diving or rock climbing not to mention access to Thailandâ s amazing cuisine and unique cultural experiences So while you canâ t go wrong how do you begin choosing which beach or beaches to add to your own itinerary Start with the list below Weâ ve tried to touch on every coastal region of the country with a mix of beaches that are iconic and easy to reach as well as islands that take a bit more work to get to Get inspired with our list of the best beaches in Thailand Semi hidden Nui Beach is a gem among the popular beach destinations near Phuket ltdedigos Shutterstock Nui Beach Best beach for escaping the Phuket crowds Big hitter beaches in Phuket Province such as Patong and Kamala get all the press â which means they also draw all the crowds and touts To strike out on your own head to this semi hidden beach on the islandâ s far southern shore Accessible via a two mile walk down a steep hill or a brief bumpy ride in the back of the truck a petite cove attractively framed by palm trees and massive boulders forms Nui Beach Youâ ll find a handful of low key bars and restaurants â and although you wonâ t be alone you almost certainly wonâ t feel like part of the crowd Local tip Nui Beach has emerged as something of an Instagram posing ground with swings frames and photogenic seats set up at the beachâ s perimeter promising that perfect shot At Ao Thong Yee Bay youâ ll find more fishermen than fellow sunseekers Stefffino Shutterstock Ao Khanom Best beach for encountering fishermen â and fish For beautiful stretches of sand largely untouched by tourists head to Nakhon Si Thammarat Province a hour bus or hour train ride or a one hour flight from Bangkok In the northern part of the province Ao Khanom offers a lengthy picture perfect tropical bay where youâ re more likely to encounter local fishers and their brightly colored boats than crowds If youâ re lucky you might even get to cross fins with one of the regionâ s adorable pink dolphins Local tip Consider a side trip just south to Sichon District where the Buddhist temple Wat Chedi is known as Thailandâ s â Chicken Temple â The devout leave cement roosters as offerings here â and tens of thousands of them including some larger than a long tailed boat can be found in an adjacent chicken â cemetery â Tubtim Bay Ko Samet Best beach for easy access from Bangkok It is easy to get to from Bangkok itâ s true â and Ko Samet with its famous white sands is a seriously beautiful island as well On the islandâ s east shore the resort of Tubtim Bay provides good accommodation a solid restaurant and a great main beach â plus access to semi hidden lesser known coves and tiny beaches Local tip More popular with Thais than foreigners Ko Samet draws lots of Thai university students and the domestic LGBTIQ crowd A late night beachside acoustic guitar session fueled by a bottle of SangSom is a classic Ko Samet experience If itâ s peaceful palm lined beaches you dream of Thailandâ s Ko Kut is for you Getty Images Ko Kut Best beach for little visited islands The best way to stay connected Saily provides a hassle free solution to travel data â just choose your data plan and prepare for your trip When you get to your destination you can go online right away Get your eSIM Thailandâ s east is on the radar of few beach seekers â yet those who find their way there will enjoy some of Thailandâ s most beautiful â and little visited â islands as their reward At the edge of the Gulf of Thailand just across from Cambodia Ko Kut is the remotest speck of a tiny archipelago that includes the better known Ko Chang The beaches here especially Hat Khlong Chao and others on the islandâ s west coast have sand as fine as talcum powder and more palm trees than hotels Since this is the fourth largest island in Thailand thereâ s much to explore both on the coast and inland including waterfalls and day hikes Planning tip You can reach Ko Kut via Laem Sok in Trat Province If Cambodia is on your itinerary itâ s possible to cross the border at Hat Lek If you prefer a more active beach experience consider a climb on the cliffs and karst formations above Railay King Ropes Access Shutterstock Railay Best beach for dramatic scenery With a backdrop of sheer towering karst cliffs that look almost artificial Railay in Krabi Province boasts the most dramatic setting of just about any beach in Thailand Those cliffs â as well as the karst formations that jut out from the sea â are also great for climbing with lots of established routes Alternatively if you donâ t want to strap on a harness make the hike to Railayâ s lagoon which involves a stop to enjoy amazing views over the peninsula Railay is also well positioned for boat jaunts to ocean based climbing spots in the area or trips to hidden beaches and snorkeling spots in Phang Nga Bay Planning tip While Railay is not on an island those cliffs mean that it can only be reached by boat from Ao Nang Ko Phi Phi Krabi or Ao Nam Mao Surin Islands Marine National Park contains some of Thailandâ s best diving spots â and the scenery is pretty prime above the surface too Jamoo Shutterstock Surin Islands Marine National Park Best beach for scuba diving This archipelago of five islands is one of Thailandâ s premier diving spots And above sea level the protected natural refuge offers snow white sand jade and turquoise hued water rocky headlands rugged jungle and wildlife galore Home to the islandâ s only accommodation and restaurant Ko Surin Nuea is one of the best spots to appreciate all thatâ s on offer Another of the islands Ko Surin Tai is home to a relocated community of Moken who were known in another era as â sea gypsiesâ before the tsunami they were among the few cultures who organized their society almost entirely at sea Planning tip The only way to overnight here is via national park accommodation on Ko Surin Nuea You can book rooms or tents via the DNP official online portal once in Thailand or through agents on the mainland in Khuraburi who also operate transportation to and from the islands Maya Bay is so popular that authorities have limited access Plan ahead to enjoy its beauty Balate Dorin Shutterstock Maya Bay Best beach for a cinematic experience Located on an island that forms part of Hat Noppharat Taraâ Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park Maya Bay is simply one of Thailandâ s most gorgeous beaches Indeed its fine white sand clear waters and palm trees were so perfect that it was featured in the film The Beach Unfortunately this star turn led to the same fall from grace that beset its fictional counterpart too many people found out about it In Thai authorities decided to close Maya Bay After a clean up program and some time for the natural environment to recover it reopened in with strict restrictions on visitor numbers visit duration one hour activities swimming is not allowed and strict sustainability goals Planning tip Access to Maya Bay via speedboat from Krabi Ko Phi Phi Don and Ko Lanta is generally banned between August and October Itâ s not possible to overnight there at any time of year Ko Kradanâ s gloriously secluded Sunset Beach doesn t get a lot of visitors MONKEYFOTO Shutterstock Sunset Beach Ko Kradan Best secluded Thailand beach Trang Province boasts some of Thailandâ s most fabulous beachy areas â and away from the typical visitor circuit they receive relatively few visitors Arguably the handsomest of the lot is Ko Kradan an island with slender silky white sand beaches that ring a lush jungly interior While thereâ s little development anywhere on the island if you really want to escape it all head to Sunset Beach a tiny rocky outpost on the islandâ s western shore It might be one of the best secluded beaches in Thailand Planning tip The landlocked provincial capital and likely your access to the island Trang is one of Thailandâ s best food cities Be sure to tack on a night here to take advantage of the cityâ s fantastic dim sum halls noodle shacks and markets Away from the Full Moon Party madness there are plenty of secluded spots on Ko Pha Ngan â such as Bottle Beach Getty Images Bottle Beach Ko Pha Ngan Best beach for avoiding full moon parties The laid back vibes of Ko Pha Ngan have drawn backpackers since the These days the infamous Full Moon Party is the islandâ s biggest attraction and the event has its passionate fans as well as detractors Yet if youâ re not looking to party youâ ll find plenty of quiet coastal sandy places well away from the dance floor Located on the islandâ s northern shore Hat Khuat also known as Bottle Beach consists of a dreamy slice of white sand backed by green hills and fronted by turquoise waters When youâ re finished sunbathing there are opportunities for swimming snorkeling or even a day hike to a nearby fishing village Planning tip The quietest months on Ko Pha Ngan are April to June Ko Lipe is a favorite of Thais in search of a beach getaway fokke baarssen Shutterstock Ko Lipe Best beach to find vacationing Thais Among Thai tourists Ko Lipe has been the â itâ island escape for several years now thanks to its remote location in Satun Province and access to some of the best diving in the region Some unpleasant inland development has followed as a result Yet the islandâ s two longest beaches Sunset Beach and Sunrise Beach still amaze both salt white crescents of sand backed by verdant hills with access to nearby protected reefs a few meters off the shore Planning tip Ko Lipe is generally only accessible from mid October to mid May via boats to from Pak Bara in Satun Have aspirations to go beyond Thailand Boats link Ko Lipe and Pulau Langkawi in Malaysia Time your visit to a Thai beach to avoid the monsoon season â and perhaps the crowds of the busiest periods diegocardini Getty Images The best times to visit Thailand beaches Peak season on all islands and mainland beaches is December to February On the Andaman Coast and the islands off the eastern seaboard crowds start to thin as rainy season June to October approaches But July and August are still busy on the southern gulf islands of Ko Samui Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao where good weather remains until the monsoon season from October to December Most mainland beaches get the monsoon between June and October except for Ao Khanom which has similar weather to the southern gulf islands All beaches get much busier and prices go up on public holidays especially during Songkran the Thai New Year in April When you to travel to beaches in Thailand try to keep in mind that the infrastructure at many is stretched to the limit threatening local ecosystems Nathapon EX Shutterstock How to visit beaches in Thailand responsibly Thailandâ s islands and beaches are so popular that tourism infrastructure is often stretched to the limit especially during the peak winter tourist season December to February Rampant development is increasingly threatening ecosystems as larger hotels and mega resorts have replaced guesthouses and beach huts Jet Skis buzz across bays and islands struggle to maintain adequate fresh water supplies and to dispose of waste without negatively impacting the environment Water pollution and large numbers of visitors can have a harmful effect on coral reefs especially Visitors can play their part in reducing the impact of overtourism Opt for lesser known islands or beaches such as Ko Kut Ko Mak and Ko Wai on the eastern seaboard or Ko Yao Noi Ko Chang Ranong or Ko Phayam on the Andaman Coast Travel out of high season â if you donâ t mind a little monsoon rain the quietest and cheapest period on the Andaman Coast is June to October Check the eco credentials and safety records of tour operators and dive outfits before booking Dispose of garbage carefully Take care when diving and snorkeling
