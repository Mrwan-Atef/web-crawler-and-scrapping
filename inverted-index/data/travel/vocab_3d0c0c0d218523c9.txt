New Orleans The Last Bohemia Underworld Courtesy of Jacqueline Bishop and Arthur Roger Gallery TRAVEL DIGITAL NOMAD New Orleans The Last Bohemia By Andrew Evans June min read I first met Jacqueline Bishop down in Cuba where we both found Havana reminiscent of her own hometown New Orleans A seasoned traveler and visual artist Jacqueline takes her inspiration from the natural world and its wettest places be it Bangladesh the Amazon or her own beloved Louisiana swamps In search of the real Rhythms of the South I was glad for the chance to meet up again with Jacqueline in her white walled studio in the Lower Garden District As the summer rain fell outside our conversation ranged from oil contamination to her celebrity neighbors to where to find the best meal in town Explain your migration to New Orleans I was born in Southern California then moved to Kansas City Missouri then the Dominican Republic After the Caribbean New Orleans felt natural This city is the Upper Caribbean not just Spanish or French but combined with Africa and all the different people from the past I ve been here forty years and I cannot imagine living anywhere else What feels most Caribbean about it Oh the architecture the food the music the rhythm in the streets the fact that there s music in the streets and the fact that you can get a decent cup of coffee on every corner Also it s the attitude of the people who live in New Orleans we re separate from the United States We have our own law we have our own culture What does that mean for you as an artist I think I have more freedom to express here because we are a poor state There is less money to dictate what should be done with the arts What s the downside Laughs We are a poor state so there is less money being made in the arts Describe your work as an artist My work focuses on environmental issues both global and local It reflects thirty years of my travels in Asia and the Americas and certainly exploring my own backyard in Louisiana I use different materials from the landscape and paint I m a painter I make collages and do printmaking and watercolor I started making watercolors from the Amazon River I would take my collages to Brazil and create these watercolors from the land I made it so that each piece could not be made anywhere else in the world except right at that place And once I left it would be different and I would never be able to go back to that place because of the changes in the landscape Before the Storm Courtesy of Jacqueline Bishop and Arthur Roger Gallery What do you care most about I am very interested in the issue of extinction We seem to be headed towards a rapid acceleration of disappearing habitats for wildlife and for humans Water air soil and food chain quality have all deteriorated so quickly The devastation that followed Katrina revealed a lot of the secrets of this area It made people elsewhere look at the situation where they lived It wasn t like they could say It s way over there it doesn t matter because it filtered into so much of the rest of the country It was a total devastation here of the city was under water It seems like it has to be that kind of drama where people s live livelihoods and evidence of their own existence are affected before we realize the kind of impact we are having Katrina was in then in we had the BP oil spil l and another huge landscape devastation We re still fighting to receive compensation for BP and we see now it s revealed how deeply the legislature is involved with BP What more does it take for us to put our money and policies into clean water clean air clean soil and build up our wetlands and stop the coastal erosion I will continue to deal with these issues but it doesn t look very good Oil Rain Courtesy of Jacqueline Bishop and Arthur Roger Gallery How do you stay hopeful I stay busy in the work and I am positive I have purchased a small cottage in a country town in Mississippi that s not near any water I have as studio there I am gearing up for whatever could happen But I will continue to live in New Orleans for as long as I can and make my art because it is my home I have been here for more than half of my life and I don t really feel comfortable anywhere else And I m not leaving I ve heard a lot of New Orleanians say I m never leaving and yet they all seem to have contingency plans You have to have a plan B If you re in Sacaramento with that levee system if you re in North Carolina or if you re in New York with that subway system If you re in DC or Cape Cod if you re on any coast in America you always have to have a Plan B How does that affect the mentality of this city There s a lot of people who have a Plan B whether they re talking about it or not There s a lot of development going on in lowland areas of New Orleans and I think it s great what they re doing but they need to have a Plan B How did Katrina affect your work When it happened here I couldn t paint for a year Words felt more important to me I was writing I was trying to find answers I didn t know if I was going to have a gallery to show my work or if my husband would still have a business I didn t know where my friends were There was no time to do anything but figure out how to survive and how to carry on It might be similar to what war is like Once there s a devastation you don t know your future You just clean up the yard you clean up what the looters did but nobody s around and there is nowhere else to go Long Long Ago Courtesy of Jacqueline Bishop and Arthur Roger Gallery Hurricane Katrina took place nearly a decade ago Haven t people moved on There s not a day that goes by that you don t hear the word Katrina because everything happened pre Katrina or post Katrina Perhaps not so much with the newbies that have just moved here but for New Orleanians and the people who came right before or right after Hurricane Katrina is the watermark What does that watermark symbolize It means that New Orleans is a very different place than it was before Katrina The storm revealed so much about poverty environmental issues and politics we know that it could happen again so we have to make a plan People have become more environmentally conscious and it s certainly changed the views and focus of a lot artists A lot of artists have moved here thousands and thousands have relocated to New Orleans and there are so many emerging artists locally We have new galleries Before Katrina nobody knew St Claude a lot of musicians came from that area so it was family Now we have galleries over there It s a kind of statement like a protest We re staying we re entrepreneurs and we need a place to show our work What is it about New Orleans that makes so many artists want to be here This is the Last Bohemia left in the United States It s real We have soul Our architecture has been saved We celebrate decay We celebrate death We celebrate the dark shadows in the French Quarter We celebrate our history and architecture and food and everything that goes into it That s part of the tapestry of this old place It s not like Houston or LA where they tear it down cuz it s old With real estate if your house isn t old it s not worth anything here If it s early Century it s worth much more than something that s new There s a lot of poetry in decay there s a lot of creative energy around that history I think that affects a creative person s psyche and their inner voice about their own creative process World View Courtesy of Jacqueline Bishop and Arthur Roger Gallery What aspect of your work reflects New Orleans It s all about the decay and the water that we are surrounded by A lot of my paintings present a waterscape with things happening in it I use the materials from the landscape I collect Mississippi River water that I use in my watercolors and water from the Gulf of Mexico especially after the BP Oil Spill with the Corexit in it I fill bottles and date them then mix it with the watercolors and use it over the news press collage For the last years I ve collected garbage from these streets I ve started collecting baby shoes and painting landscapes on them I think New Orleans is very romantic and surreal the fact that we are surrounded by nature the fact that it s always creeping and changing around you can t help but work with that It s about the wildlife and the natural world coexisting with who we are as human beings down here in this hidden place You know we live next door to cemeteries that are above ground and we have parades and musical performances when someone dies We don t always have to paint something when the paint flakes off We like the decay and the history underneath New Orleans is layer after layer after layer and I think my work reflects that Where should visitors go to experience the real wildlife of New Orleans Just go downtown and you ll see the different insects and vines growing up those beautiful buildings Go to Honey Island or Jean Lafitte National Park where in April you ll see the prothonotary warblers and red winged blackbirds mixed in with the purple Louisiana irises and all those colors We have different bird species in Louisiana and we have species of oak trees Or just go and investigate in City Park and Audubon Park which are both over years old and have areas where it s not manicured it s wild But even people s backyards Sometimes alligators come into the city Coyotes come into the city because they re losing their habitat So there s snakes and lizards and possums they re all here National Geographic Expeditions Travel with National Geographic Search Trips You also live in the Garden District Well this is the Lower Garden District I m right on the line but the Garden District was the first real suburb in the United States It was settled by Americans and Europeans who were not living in the French Quarter because that s where the refined wealthy educated creoles lived Different families built the plantations here and they had all the gardens For example the house next door used to be a horse stable Today the neighborhood is a mix of writers artists and old New Orleans families A lot of waiters live here because with all the different restaurants in the area they can just walk to work Anne Rice used to live around the corner John Goodman lives down the street and so does Sandra Bullock But then these celebrities will be living right next door to a waiter or a poet a policeman That s New Orleans How do you break through the many layers of New Orleans It all depends on the tourist Some folks go to Bourbon Street and never leave so they never see New Orleans You have to get away from Bourbon Street and be savvy and ask locals where they eat and go to hear music and see art Find out what locals do because they have their favorites Also New Orleans is made up of hundreds of neighborhoods and each one has their own little restaurant I would go out and investigate all those neighborhoods that s how you find out about New Orleans Any personal restaurant recommendations I lean towards Louisiana contemporary Creole cuisine so I like Clancy s Bacchanal Tujague s and Upperline JoAnne Clevenger she s from out in the country and I ve known her for something years She first had a little flower cart in the French Quarter and now she has one of the finest restaurants in New Orleans Anderson Cooper s always in there My favorite dish is the black drum meunier which is sautéed and then laid on greens and cornbread divine They ve got great desserts too There are so many new restaurants Coquette is very good The chef is from Maryland but he reflects Louisiana cuisine And you can t go wrong with any of the Brennan Restaurants and Antoine s We have our own waiter there Charles We ve been using him for twenty years We first had his uncle then his father now him Oh And Herbsaint Donald Link ranks in my top chefs in the city He also does Cochon and the Butcher and they re both superb What do you miss most about New Orleans when you re away Two days ago I was flying home and I happened to be sitting by the window It was in the daytime and when I saw Louisiana with water on both sides and I saw the wetlands I took a picture and put it on Facebook with the caption I am so glad to be home back in the swamps I m a swamp girl It s that closeness with the earth you know everything is tingling with life It s the most misunderstood ecosystem in the world and I live in it I find that to be special You can t find that anywhere else Visitors to New
