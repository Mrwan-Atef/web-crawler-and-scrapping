Islandâ s beaches Ray Bartlett Apr min read Share Rhode Island beaches are what New England summer vacation dreams are made of Michaela Hession Shutterstock Summer in Rhode Island is all about embracing the outdoors The stateâ s pristine beaches offer sun soaked days of swimming surfing and sunbathing And while it may be Americaâ s smallest state Rhode Island has plenty to offer for a great summer vacation You ll find great food fun wineries rich history and spectacular beaches making it a top getaway destination not just in New England but up and down the eastern coastline Donâ t miss a visit to Newport where you can stroll along the Cliff Walk and tour opulent Gilded Age mansions These are some of Americaâ s most impressive mansions legacies of railway tycoons and industrial moguls who came to Newport only in the summer sometimes just for a week or two yet who built mansions so decadent theyâ ve been used in movie adaptations of The Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald Whether you re a history buff or nature lover â or simply seeking relaxation by the sea â this charming state will make you glad you visited Here are some suggestions on what to see and do Advertisement Second Beach is popular with tourist and locals Getty Images iStockphoto Where to base yourself Second Beach Vibes Middletown s Second Beach is just about miles from Newport which is hard to beat as a summer destination Newport s influx of visitors means there are plenty of things to do while youâ re here Yes itâ s touristy but itâ s a classy crowd and itâ s impossible to argue with the cityâ s quiet coastal charm With the Newport mansions and the Newport Jazz Festival held each year in August thereâ s an artsyness and stately vibe that resonates beyond the beaches bars and sunbathers Do Visit the Cliff Walk see the Breakers or Marble House mansions and gawk or gag at how luxurious opulent and excessive the upper lived Those who surf will want to wax up the boards and head out on some great swell Eat Floâ s Clam Shack is a great spot thatâ s only a few minutes drive or a short walk away Itâ s been in business since the and has cheap seafood thatâ s great for anyone craving a bite after a day on the beach Sleep Surfers will want to check out Second Beach Campground Yes youâ ll need to keep things family friendly voices down no drunkenness or substance abuse but you can get up when the tide is right and literally walk to the beach South Shore Beach Vibes This delightful stretch of sand in Little Compton offers peace and quiet a sharp contrast to frenetic Newport and its more popular beaches The vibe here is chill and unpretentious mostly families with kids couples and college aged sunbathers who stake out spots and enjoy the white sand pebbles shells and the occasional crab or skate egg case Do For those non beachgoers who enjoy boutique shopping and gourmet dining head six miles north to Tiverton Four Corners quaint village center Browse unique shops featuring local crafts fine art and antiques then grab some fresh cuisine at a cozy eatery Eat If you re heading up to Tiverton Four Corners check out Gray s Ice Cream which has been around for over years and is open year round Sleep Stone House Inn is a great option for those who like a grand old inn a great view and hospitable innkeepers The building was built in the century but has been completely renovated and modernized The wide wrap around porches are perfect for relaxing on East Beach Vibes This beach in Charlestown will probably not be for everyone because among other things access is allowed at certain times of year this activity is constrained by important nesting bird species so owners need to pay particular attention to the rules to avoid threatening endangered species You ll also need a pass to drive on the beach But because you can bring a vehicle itâ s perfect for those who like fishing or want to bring heavier items like kayaks Thereâ s great access to Ninigret Pond a vast marine estuary thatâ s part of protected Ninigret National Wildlife Refuge So paradoxically one of the beaches most drivable is also next to a pristine protected area thatâ s excellent for birding and wildlife viewing Advertisement Do Bring a kayak canoe or SUP and explore the Ninigret Pond where youâ ll find all kinds of cool critters and birds Eat The Haversham an easy five mile drive away in Westerly is a good spot to grab a beer after a bit of fishing or recreational boating and itâ s a popular watering hole for locals and tourists alike Sleep Villa Bed Breakfast in Westerly has quaint nicely furnished rooms an immaculately tended lawn brimming with flowers and great access to not just the town about miles away but also to Winnapaug Pond and the Winnapaug Farm Preserve Historic Thames Street is home to many of Newport s landmark restaurants and shops George Wirt Shutterstock Plan your menu and choose the best places to eat Youâ ll generally find decent grocery stores and a variety of mostly mid range American style restaurants in the area with more and better options in Newport and Providence If youâ re willing to hop in the car and head into the city youâ ll have your pick of spectacular fine dining great Italian or other international and fusion options â but for the beach youâ ll need to content yourself with burgers fries fish chips a steak a saladâ thereâ s not much variety beyond typical small town New England fare Most of the areaâ s fancier restaurants will accept reservations but the beachside bars and gastropubs probably will have a line The White Horse Tavern in Newport â housed in a building built in the â is a treat for history buffs and gourmands alike Those wanting refinement might want to reserve a spot at the Castle Hill Inn a resort overlooking the water with several restaurants to choose from All of them are fancy so you might consider dressing up If youâ re a seafood lover youâ re in the right place Thick and creamy New England clam chowder is a popular choice and it sticks to the ribs after a long day at the beach Lobster is for anyone who grew up here outlandishly expensive these days what seafood isnâ t but itâ s as popular as ever and makes for a great summer splurge Farm stands tend to open in June and close sometime after September but can be a good place to find fresher produce and in season local corn And those with a sweet tooth might want to try Indian Pudding a cornmeal and molasses treat that has its origins in the Indigenous cultures here Book your accommodations Rhode Island is pretty packed in the summer so the sooner you can make your reservations the better You wonâ t find the range of budget accommodations during this time either especially if you want to be close to the beach and letâ s be honest the beach is why youâ re coming Some establishments will have a two day or longer minimum stay All that to say if youâ ll be here in late June July or August book early and expect to pay more than youâ d like If youâ re not a beachgoer though â or you want to come in the shoulder seasons of May and September â youâ ll find that prices drop and availability increases While some places may close the moment Labor Day arrives in early September there are usually some good deals to be had If youâ re looking for spontaneity your best bet is to try AirBnB or VRBO which will have a wide variety of options and price points If youâ re planning to camp youâ ll again want to book as early as possible as sites fill quickly The Breakers and Cliff Walk in Newport Rhode Island Felix Lipov Shutterstock Best things to do See the Newport mansions If youâ re coming to Rhode Island from far away itâ s a must to stop in and be awed by the grandeur and excess of these â summer homes â The most famous is the Breakers constructed in the early over a span of two years Itâ s a National Historic Landmark and was initially owned by the Vanderbilt family but its creator Charles Vanderbilt II only had four years to spend in it before he passed away at age Sachuest Point National Wildlife Refuge in Middletown Monika Salvan Shutterstock Visit Sachuest Point National Wildlife Refuge Sachuest Point National Wildlife Refuge in Middletown further down the point from Second Beach is a great place to bird watch explore saltmarshes or take a short hike for views of the ocean the Sakonnet River and the historic Sakonnet Lighthouse Long wooden staircase leading down to the beach at Mohegan Bluffs on Block Island Eric Dale Shutterstock Take the ferry to Block Island Block Island is a favorite destination with locals and it s worth the trip just for the ferry ride The main ferry access is Point Judith in Narragansett but seasonal ferries run from Newport as well Once you arrive you ll find miles of beaches and beach rose lined sandy paths Crescent Beach is within walking distance from the ferry and sits on the island s east side providing calmer surf If you have a car want to hike or crave a more rugged view check out Mohegan Bluffs on the island s south side Accessing the rocky beach below requires steps down a steep staircase but you can also just enjoy the view from the bluff Fun fact Block Island also has a tiny airport with a ft runway Surfing at Second Beach formally known as Sachuest Beach Anna Saxon for Lonely Planet Hit the surf at Second Beach Some of New Englandâ s best surfing breaks are here in this tiny state and top of the list is Second Beach which pops whenever thereâ s a decent south eastern swell Itâ s beginner friendly in that there are no reefs to wipe out on but itâ s a crowded break nearly all summer long so itâ s important to have a good understanding of the surferâ s code â basically wait your turn don t steal a wave and just be kind and considerate to fellow surfers and everyone else Go birdwatching The marshes estuaries and sandy shores make for great birding and one of the rare species youâ ll see is the piping plover These impressive shorebirds fly thousands of miles to nest here and will drop perfectly camouflaged eggs that are easy to step on â or drive over For this reason youâ ll see sections of beaches roped off during nesting season Please respect these areas as the birds are considered threatened and federally protected under the Endangered Species Act Theyâ re also adorable when the eggs hatch the tiny marshmallow sized balls of fluff that emerge tear around on their own within hours And if you see a bird fluttering helplessly near you with what looks like a broken wing guess what Youâ re near a nest and the bird is trying to lure you away Don t stay where you re standing â follow the bird as people have accidentally stepped on nests while looking for them because theyâ re that hard to see How will you get there The closest international airport is TF Green in Warwick south of Providence From there to reach the shorelines youâ ll need a vehicle which can be rented from the many agencies at the airport You can also take a train to Newport but itâ s a long trip via Providence about hours versus the or so minutes by car and you ll still find that a vehicle is necessary to get to most beaches Parking however is often a hassle requiring parking permits or daily passes Plan on spending per day to several hundred dollars monthly if youâ re not a resident What to pack Itâ s easy to want to grab a quick bite somewhere on your way back from the beach but â No Shirt No Shoes No Serviceâ signs are everywhere so have those at a minimum if you want to eat before you get home Bring a cover up sandals and â for pricier places â even a sport coat or dress if you want to impress Off the beach youâ ll see the gamut from casual T shirts and shorts all the way to the occasional business suit Though itâ s not a tropical latitude Rhode Island can get a lot of sun on summer days so bring sunscreen apply it frequently and consider covering up with a wide brimmed hat and sunglasses For kids and adults it doesnâ t hurt to have water shoes especially if you plan on exploring the marshes where shells and sharp grasses can cut tender feet Weather is famously changeable here so youâ d be wise to always bring a layer or two in case it gets chilly And for evenings out on the beach insect repellent is a must Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us
