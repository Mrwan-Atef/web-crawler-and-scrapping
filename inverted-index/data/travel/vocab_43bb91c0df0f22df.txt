Photography Ltd Awl Images TRAVEL A culinary guide to Tokyo From bargain ramen to haute cuisine dining options abound in the Japanese capital By Rob Goss May min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Exciting things continue to happen in Tokyo s dining scene In the Michelin Guide to the Japanese capital restaurants were awarded at least one star more than in Paris and New York combined Of those come with lofty three star status including chef Seiji Yamamoto s artistic kaiseki multi course menu at RyuGin and the Edo style sushi at Masahiro Yoshitake s Sushi Yoshitake British chef Daniel Calvert himself no stranger to a Michelin stars described working in the city as every chef s dream when he launched his restaurant SÃ©zanne at the Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Marunouchi in And he s not the only one who thinks this way Virgilio Martinez and Massimo Bottura are also among the acclaimed international chefs to have opened outposts here in recent years Yet for all its fine dining finesse Tokyo s culinary scene is just as much about the joy of casual everyday dishes Three ramen joints Ginza Hachigo Konjiki Hototogisu and Nakiryu have been awarded a Michelin star each while a couple of hundred Bib Gourmand awards give a deserved nod to good value comfort food such as soba noodles tonkatsu cutlets and kare raisu curry and rice The latter a weeknight staple in many homes is thought to have arrived with the Japanese Imperial Navy who may have encountered an adulterated version of Indian curries being eaten by British sailors Meanwhile to sample a dish that s little known outside of Japan pay a visit to the Ryogoku neighbourhood for chanko nabe the hearty hotpot eaten in large quantities by sumo wrestlers looking to bulk up Or head to the Tsukishima district to try grilled monjayaki the runny batter might not look appetising when first poured onto the hotplate but it turns into a wonderfully addictive savoury goo Beyond dining Tokyo is also a great drinks destination home to inventive mixologists like Hiroyasu Koyama of Bar Benfiddich and Shingo Gokan of The SG Club There s also a well established craft beer scene which has a habit of adding a Japanese accent to imported styles a hint of yuzu in a weissen perhaps or the numbing tingle of sansho pepper in a golden ale internationally acclaimed whisky and of course sake brewed using centuries old techniques The late chef and broadcaster Anthony Bourdain once said that if he had to eat in only one city for the rest of his life if would be Tokyo And once you ve dined out in the Japanese capital it s hard to disagree At Tapas Molecular Bar art is the inspiration behind chef Kento Ushikubo s creative dishes which feature Japanese ingredients such as wagyu beef Photograph by Mandarin Oriental Fine dining restaurants Tapas Molecular Bar The tapas inspired fusion at this eight seat counter restaurant in Mandarin Oriental Tokyo lies somewhere between art and a science experiment The menu changes seasonally but can include imaginative creations like smoked barbecue pork and sesame ash designed to look like a smouldering cigar RyuGin Seiji Yamamoto s artful take on refined kaiseki ryori Japan s haute cuisine has earned three Michelin stars for his restaurant located in the smart Tokyo Hibiya Midtown complex The menu is omakase meaning guests leave it up to the chef to decide on the array of small dishes served Sushi Yoshitake Technique and the finest produce play a major role at chef Masahiro Yoshitake s three Michelin starred sushi restaurant But so too does inventiveness the nigiri rice is seasoned with red vinegar rather than the usual white rice vinegar and highlights include steamed abalone with a liver and sea urchin sauce Cocktail bars you shouldn t miss The SG Club Named one of the World s Best Bars this Shibuya spot is spread across two floors Upstairs Guzzle offers drinks such as gin and tonic infused with condensed beer downstairs speakeasy styled Sip serves up creations like the signature tomato tree cocktail above combining gin tomato dill elderflower and mastic Bar Benfiddich Owner and mixologist Hiroyasu Kayama creates cocktails at this Shinjuku bar using foraged botanicals along with ingredients such as wormwood yuzu and anise grown on his farm north of the capital There s no menu but expect plenty of absinthe and lesser known spirits from around the world Kamiya Bar A Tokyo stalwart Kamiya Bar was the city s first Western style bar when it opened in the late Staff in jackets and ties add an old school vibe but the boisterous atmosphere and menu are more reminiscent of an izakaya Try a shot of the signature denki bran electric brandy a mix of curacao gin and brandy Where to get coffee Koffee Mameya Kakeru A addition to the Kiyosumi Shirakawa neighbourhood something of a hub for artisanal roasteries Koffee Mameya Kakeru is a hip minimalist affair The coffee stacks up too particularly the tasting courses

houses a fascinating collection of Japanese artefacts including samurai swords and Buddhist artworks For lunch head to Ameya Yokocho a narrow open air market filled with hundreds of shops and stalls

How to plan a day in Tsukiji Ginza With its sleek modern architecture and upmarket shops Ginza couldn t be more of a contrast to down to earth Tsukiji built on land reclaimed from the marshlands of the Sumida River Together though they offer a wonderfully contrasting overview of the city Tsukiji was once known as the site of the world s largest fish and seafood wholesale market until the latter was relocated in The neighbourhood s Tsukiji Outer Market however remains a buzzing spot with its narrow lanes hosting a mix of stores and restaurants and some of the best sushi deals in town Sushizanmai offers lunch sets starting at around yen for pieces Some of Tokyo s best value sushi and seafood is to be found among the lanes of Tsukiji Outer Market Photograph by Travel Pix Collection

yakitori chicken skewers thigh breast heart skin liver wing and gizzard are all options are served as an omakase course along with a lively vibe Where to eat ramen in Tokyo It would be a culinary crime to come to Tokyo and not try ramen the city s preeminent soul food Most Tokyoites have an opinion on what makes the perfect version whether that s the texture and thickness of the noodles the quality of the chashu braised pork topping or the recipe behind the all important broth It s the latter that tends to give each ramen style its name The pork bone based tonkotsu ramen has a creamy richness while shio salt ramen features a more refreshing seafood based broth that can be subtle and complex Miso ramen meanwhile offers a warming heartiness ideal on a chilly day Then there s shoyu ramen a Tokyo staple that sees soy sauce added to a base broth Ramen takes many forms but this noodle soup typically features toppings such as nori spring onion and a perfectly cooked soft boiled egg Photograph by Alexander Spatari Getty Images In Minamiotsuka Nakiryu may look as basic as any other neighbourhood ramen shop but it s earned a Michelin star for its lineup which includes a killer shoyu Highlighting the growing diversity of ramen is Ginza Hachigo where owner chef Yasushi Matsumura applies his French culinary background to combine chicken duck shiitake seaweed and other ingredients in a broth more akin to a velvety consommÃ© Elsewhere there are good vegan options available Afuri in Ebisu serves a rainbow ramen featuring a plant based broth and wheat noodles blended
