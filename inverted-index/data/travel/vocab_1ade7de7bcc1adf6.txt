Q A Why do you travel Travel makes me feel free I can be a tourist checking off major attractions on my list and I can be a wide eyed traveler with a blank slate on the lookout for local experiences Every trip is empowering and impactful What s one thing you never travel without A reliable pair of sneakers I like to walk and get lost so I m always in sneakers unless there s a dress code or I m on the beach What was your worst travel experience Egypt The airline lost my luggage it came the next afternoon We had run ins with cops But worst I got severely dehydrated on a cruise on the Nile and had to be given a shot Worst nightmare for a traveler to be sick and puking in a foreign country Japan comes close I loved the country the people the food but my shoulder got strained and I couldn t move my arm or change my clothes without howling in pain alone in my hotel room Where did you have your most unforgettable meal All the meals in Japan Tempura shabu shabu miso soup Tokyo Banana Truffle pizza at Badrutt s Palace Chesa Veglia is something else that I remember fondly What s on your travel bucket list Tuscany Hampi Utah I ve picked spectacular hotels to stay at What s the first thing you do when you arrive in a new place Tell mom I ve landed safely and exchange currency What are your favorite countries destinations to travel to I ll go back to Australia in a jiffy because a close friend lives there and we haven t done the Gold Coast yet I ve been to Goa some six seven times and I m planning another trip this year When were you first bitten by the travel bug I didn t start traveling until my early It was a Bollywood movie Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani that inspired me and a lucky break at Travel Leisure India South Asia that made it possible Carry on or checked Always checked My backpack is heavy enough I like to stroll around drink coffee and browse books at airports Much easier to do all this without a suitcase If you could live in any hotel where would it be Ovolo Woolloomooloo in Sydney perhaps because it has free breakfast complimentary mini bar coffee and snacks in the lobby hour access gym and self service laundry It s right on the wharf and has
