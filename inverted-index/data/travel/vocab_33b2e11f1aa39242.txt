Ligaya Malones Sep min read Share Don t try to cover everything on your first visit to California â it s important to take time to enjoy it Â Jordi Salas Getty Images As a newbie California resident keen on exploring as much of my adopted home as possible I was struck by how geographically diverse the Golden State is the impracticalities of making a quick trip to one part of the state from the other end of it and its surprisingly variable weather Gleaned over nearly years of West Coast living these tips and good to knows will help you travel to and within California with ease and confidence Weâ ll start with logistics and other practicalities before moving into considerations for booking cultural attractions and activities and the best way to explore our incredible parks beaches and mountain regions Donâ t try to cram it all in at once From frothy coastlines to scenic deserts expansive mountain ranges buzzing metropolitan cities and more remote corners California really has it all Its terrain covers more than miles from north to south and its diversity means thereâ s always more to explore no matter how much time you have planned Advertisement Consider focusing your trip on a few regions or planning your trip by theme such as national and state parks or a coastal road trip along Highway Hone in on your itinerary A week in the Golden State presents opportunities to combine urban exploration with nearby picturesque jaunts You could spend several days in San Francisco then commune with ancient redwoods in Muir Woods another day before cycling along Half Moon Bay the next From a home base in Los Angeles or San Diego a week affords a few overnight stays in Temecula Valleyâ s wine region desert vibes in Joshua Tree or the mountain towns of Big Bear Idyllwild and Julian Prepare to pay more for everything Californians joke that pricier well everything is the trade off colloquially known as the sunshine tax for our idyllic weather In other words thereâ s a level of acceptance travelers would benefit from before arriving California has the highest sales tax rate in the country among others so be prepared to fork over more than in other states for lodging food fuel entertainment and parking You ll need more than your swimsuit in California â pack layers for when the sun goes down Â Cavan Images RF Getty Images Pack layers California is endowed with lots of sunshine but you may need more than a pair of jeans and a t shirt to navigate all that the state offers Pack for colder temps during Californiaâ s winter season at elevation like Mammoth and Tahoe The coast is typically a bit cooler than inland regions and generally a light sweater or jacket may be required once the sun sets Book campsites in advance Yosemite â s imposing granite walls and Joshua Tree â s alien like cacti and dark skies draw millions of travelers to California each year Secure your spot in these popular parks and book campsites and entrance reservations up to six months in advance Also be mindful of seasonality Reservations for parks in desert regions like Death Valley National Park and Joshua Tree fill up for the winter and early spring months while coastal campsites book up for summer Advertisement Take advantage of accessible attractions There is always more to be done to ensure everyone experiences all that California offers and the state continues to consider the needs of individuals with varying physical and cognitive abilities Disneylandâ s Disability Access Service lets eligible guests schedule return times for certain experiences and offers a comprehensive guide detailing each attractionâ s sensory features â from loud noises to scents Legoland offers a similar program including an Assisted Access Pass that allows guests to board a first choice ride without waiting scheduled times for other rides and designated quiet areas Museums offer varying levels of accessibility resources like wheelchairs assisted listening devices and more including Berkeley Art Museum Pacific Film Archive BAMPFA and the Broad a contemporary art museum in Los Angeles Outdoor enthusiasts will find paved paths at beaches like Oxnard Beach Park and June Lake in the High Sierras Entire cities are taking action as well Visalia a central California city that makes a convenient entry point for Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks was recognized as a Certified Autism Destination Many of its hotels and family friendly attractions meet the criteria to ensure autistic and sensory sensitive individuals have a comfortable experience In southern California Palm Springs tourism organization is pursuing similar efforts to grow the number of its certified attractions like the Childrenâ s Discovery Museum of the Desert Look beyond the big cities for fine dining in California Â Peathegee Inc Getty Images Tetra images RF Seek award winning dining beyond metropolitan centers Excellent award winning eats are the norm in Californiaâ s major cities But travelers can also find them in its more suburban and sparsely populated parts You can find Michelin rated eats at Petiscos a Portuguese small plates restaurant in San Jose Bombera a Mexican restaurant in Oakland Chez Noir in Carmel by the Sea Knife Pleat in Costa Mesa and Valle a modern Mexican restaurant in Oceanside Additionally James Beard Americaâ s Classics recognized restaurants highlight delicious home style cooking in lesser known parts of California like Casa Vega in Sherman Oaks and Pho in Garden Grove Take advantage of year round peak produce Californiaâ s farmers markets are a colorful way to scope out whatâ s fresh and in season and discover first hand why its produce is some of the best in the country Aside from visiting a farm directly itâ s a great way to connect to an industry that cultivates more than a third of the United Statesâ vegetables and two thirds of its fruits and nuts Every market is a little different and likely includes prepared foods and hand crafted goods live musical entertainment and kid friendly activities Check out Californiaâ s islands Californiaâ s islands are worth their own detour Thereâ s an island for every adventurer whether youâ re looking for resort style comforts or seeking something more rustic Intrepid travelers should consider the rugged Channel Islands while Catalina Island blends luxury hotels with outdoor adventures A bridge to Coronado Island in San Diego reveals wide powdery beaches perfect for building sandcastles and sunbathing in front of a historic Victorian hotel California s incredible landscape is full of wildlife and it s essential to keep a respectful distance Â Getty Images Respect wildlife and sealife Occasionally and though rare it is possible to catch sight of a mountain lion coyotes at dawn and dusk and snakes on the trails Along beaches and near harbors itâ s also common to glimpse seals and otters Keep your distance once you notice them and know that youâ re likely too close for comfort if they notice you first Dial for emergencies and contact the Department of Fish and Wildlife to report all other incidents Acknowledge Californiaâ s original stewards Indigenous communities are some of Californiaâ s most invaluable stewards of its open nature filled spaces Initiatives and partnerships like Reexamining Our Past Initiative are aimed at better acknowledging and reflecting these communities history and culture This entails practical measures such as renaming Sue meg State Park in Humboldt County and efforts to expand exhibits that illustrate the native communityâ s contributions to the area like Old Town State Historic Park in San Diego Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order
