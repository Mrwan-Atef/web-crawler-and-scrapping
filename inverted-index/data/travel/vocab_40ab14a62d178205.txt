flavors to make a memorable meal Excellent serving staff Kitchen and room staff both take food sriopusly and appreciate it when custoemrs want a particulalry good meal and are willing to discuss it as it progresses Swiss Chalet best food for the lowest prices with decent service When you do the final math this may be the best restaurant in Toronto Select Bistro when I want to go to Paris need serving staff who speak English and don t want to take an airplane I just go there Queen Street West between Peter and Spadina Hot House Cafe Front Street East at Church Street Reasonable prices resonable service decent steaks excellent pizza kid friendly nice decor I used to eat there so often I had my own table but then I moved But this is not a place for out of towners looking for the best

Actually it s a wine bar quite small with only tables He is such an amazing chef in the days when he owned and ran the Palmerston it was the best restaurant around This one will probably be just as wonderful Reply Meesthare View Public Profile Send a private message to Meesthare Find More Posts by Meesthare Find Trip Reports Dec PM Join Date Feb Posts Likes Received Likes on Posts I also love Le Select Bistro but Byzantium Church amp Wellesley might nose out Select on steak frites Select knocked out my wine snob friends from the UK Other favourites Kalendar on College St W romantic affordable Pho Hung Bloor location for Saturday lunch during Bloor Annex shopping or when studying for exams at U of T Spring Rolls either Front St or Yonge St location when six of you crave Asian food but each wants a different type Chinese Thai Vietnamese etc Reply View Public Profile Send a private message to Find More Posts by Find Trip Reports Dec AM dial Join Date Mar Posts Likes Received Likes on Posts Most of previous suggestions are good but have not included the quot high end quot places if budget is not an issue North continues to be my favourite great food and professional service Susur a great chef previously rated as top ten globally Canoe not on my favourite list but good food with a great view form the floor of TD Centre Scaramouche great food with good view of downtown Toronto as it sits on hillside in an aprtment building Truffles in the Four Seasons Hotel never been but people enjoy Pangaea on Bay St one that I enjoy although it rarely gets listed in quot top ten lists quot good food good wine list attentive service and some of Toronto s best desserts A more moderate place C for two is Cafe Brussel great musssles in a beautiful art deco room Enjoy Reply Trending Topics

Village is high on my personal favourites list The neighbourhood is quaint the restaurant is small and the food is amazing As the name would imply save room for dessert the gourmet pastries reminded

Took you recommendation and ate with the kids at Hot House Cafe Pretty good for lunch and very kid firendly Thanks Out of the ten I am also sad to say that I have only been to Hiro which was pretty good but not IMO worthy of top ten in TO Must try Lemon Meringue I have heard from several people that it is really great Anyone heard anything about the new restaurant Xaphire on Eglinton Avenue West Reply jamierin View Public Profile Send a private message to jamierin Find More Posts by jamierin Find Trip Reports Jan AM clearthinker Join Date Jan Posts Likes Received Likes on Posts I was just doing a search on Xaphire since I am going there tonight for dinner Friends of mine say it is fantastic I will post about our experience tomorow If you want fantastic food try the Town Grille on Carlton just at Parliament or Verveine on Queen East by Pape I don t remember who was on about steak frites but you wont be dissapointed at either Brunch at Verveine is one of my favorite things like brown paper packages tied up with string there is just something about it that is right Reply clearthinker View Public Profile Send a private message to clearthinker Find More Posts by clearthinker Find Trip Reports Jan PM clearthinker Join Date Jan Posts Likes Received Likes on Posts Xaphire Just got back from dinner there An interesting experience In a nutshell the food was really very good and the service attentive I would not recomend going there if you are in a big hurry My date and I arrived at to meet some friends Our server greeted us promptly and took our drink orders alas they did not show for minutes Our group was about people Everyone was very happy with their food My date and I shared the chicken spring rolls wich were not out of this world and a two person serving of Lemongrass Soup with Shrimp that was very enjoyable For main courses she had the Crispy Noodles with chicken and I had the Xaphire steak on recomendation of our waiter Georges DeBeouf Beaujolais was our wine of choice for dinner I am not really sure what happend but by our food had not arrived Our server came by to replenish water and top up wine glasses as necessary and appologized for the delay in our meal We brought us complimentary calimari and when a further delay occured complimentary shrimp chips and peanut sauce I have to admit the wait was worth it The Xaphire steak blue did not disappoint It melted like butter in my mouth and the crispy noodle chicken was really good if a tad cold I also had occasion to sample the spicey beef medium with crunchy green beans that was very good as well For dessert we split deep fried bananas How can you go Thai and not Like I said if you have time to kill and good company to spend it with then Xaphire is a great spot to pass an evcning Trendy decor and attentive staff the manager came over to explain that Charles prepares each meal fresh and that is why the delay The bottom line is two apps two mains two before dinner drinks a bottle of wine and a shared desert plus tip and yes I would go back PS if it is out like it was tonight make sure anyone who gets cold wears an extra sweater The front of the restaurant is glass and as a result it s kind of chilly Thanks and happy eating Reply clearthinker View Public Profile Send a private message to clearthinker Find More Posts by clearthinker Find Trip Reports Jan PM Join Date

not your typical Toronto Lounge in that the menu is first rate The chef from Bloom via Foccacia oversees their kitchen and designs the menu He comes in almost everynight to make sure the cooks are delivering up to his standard What you end up with is a dish that you would get elsewhere for and here everything is under Reply vanweb View Public Profile Send a private message to vanweb Find More

beside Susur s new place Lee It is a fine dining French restaurant with all of the menu ingredients that you would expect truffles foie gras plus some that you would not like bison carpaccio The place is owned by Chef Marc Thuet formerly of Rosewater The Fifth Centro and his wife It is Fine Dining but not overly stuffy they have a long bar that you can sit at and drink wine while being server free quot bar snacks quot Dont worry we are not talking about peanuts here they bring out traditional Alsation French snacks breads dips and an amazing phyllo pizza dish The menu is pris fixe and expensive but I say it is worth it the food tasted amazing I had the Skate stuffed with salmon mousse and it was wonderful The menu changes every month see the website http www thuet ca menu asp Reply vanweb

Finjan Middle Eastern Restaurant in Oakville What makes it extra special is its authentic Middle Eastern flavors paired with a warm welcoming ambiance The food is halal and the variety is impressive from juicy beef shish and lamb tajine to their famous Kunafa dessert Reply View Public Profile Send a private message to Find More Posts by Find Trip Reports Reply Subscribe Related Topics Thread
