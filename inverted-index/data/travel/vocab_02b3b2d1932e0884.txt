Mirza Puneetinder Kaur Sidhu Jan min read Share Delhi and Mumbai both brim with history architecture and unforgettable food iStock Shutterstock Loud chaotic majestic and photogenic â sometimes all at once â India has long cast a spell on travelers Yet choosing just where to visit in this continent size country can pose challenges â especially when it comes to the big cities where youâ ll likely begin any itinerary Should you visit the historic capital of Delhi or century upstart Mumbai We asked two writers to make for each of these world class places Advertisement In gracious green spaces like Lodi Gardens you can relax among traces of Delhiâ s rich past Shutterstock Dive straight into Delhi Puneetinder Kaur Sidhu now calls Chandigarh home â yet Delhi her coming of age city will always have her heart Letâ s face it by the time Mumbai came into its own in the early century Delhi had already been the center of power over seven formidable empires Eight if we count its time as Indraprastha the capital of the Pandava kingdom in the mythological Hindu epic Mahabharata The atmospheric century ruins of Purana Qila supposedly now stand in the literary cityâ s place Centuries of turmoil including the struggle for freedom against colonial rule have endowed Delhi with the ability to rise from the ashes time and again How else do you think Dilliwalas acquired their carpe diem spirit Or their love for la dolce vita for that matter The Indian capital might feel fast paced and modern â and it is But itâ s all comes wrapped up in a rich layered past Itâ s this dichotomy that attracts me to Delhi it s a young and vibrant city unburdened by its history The two simply coexist No other Indian city can match Delhiâ s depth of heritage Alongside biggies like the Red Fort and the Jama Masjid mosque architectural gems hide in plain sight Theyâ re found along the packed lanes of Shahjahanabad and are laid out along the broad leafy boulevards that radiate out from India Gate such as the former stately home to the British Viceroy Rashtrapati Bhavan which crowns Raisina Hill History hides behind the glitzy upmarket malls of Saket and stands tall in Mehrauliâ s Qutb Minar Complex engulfed by the dense Aravalli woodlands Sorry Mumbai You canâ t match this Then thereâ s Delhiâ s vibrant food scene a mouthwatering mÃ lange of cultures past and present Fed by an ability to absorb people without making them feel like outsiders the capital has some of the finest flavors Indian cuisine has to offer From the Mughlai influenced chaats savory street snacks niharis slow cooked meat stews and kebabs of Old Delhi to legacy dining at the iconic Bukhara or Dum Pukht the city is stuffed with great places to eat Premium fine dining happens at restaurants like Indian Accent and the capital also offers the best in global cuisine including Peruvian Ethiopian Japanese and beyond Experiential travelers will find bespoke culinary walks that visit the Khari Baoli spice market or include cooking classes with home chefs or dining with local families From street food stalls to five star hotel restaurants you won t go hungry in Delhi MJ Mahesh Shutterstock Advertisement Popular regional Indian cuisines have also taken center stage in Delhi You can now eat fine Naga pork at Dzukou Tribal Kitchen relish a variety of Bihari thalis at The Potbelly or dig into the Tamil and French specialties at ChÃ teau de PondichÃ ry And while I confess that no one can do a vada pao deep fried potato dumpling served in a bun itâ s my all time favorite street snack like Mumbai Delhi trumps the Maximum City for all other deliciousness Even nature Unlike Mumbaiâ s skyscrapers Delhi spreads out under one of Indiaâ s greenest canopies the city is lush and home hundreds of tree species including the year old Khirni evergreen Massive public parks â like the century tomb speckled Lodi Garden near posh Khan Market and the newly refurbished Sunder Nursery adjoining Humayunâ s Tomb â give Dilliwalas space to breathe As an international travel hub and politically charged city state Delhi is also a cultural hotspot and shopping mecca You can seek out bargains galore at Janpath and Sarojini Nagar markets or go luxury clothes shopping in the cityâ s deluxe malls Breakaway India â s textile and sustainability tours even allow visitors to buy directly from skilled artisans Thereâ s simply no reason to visit anywhere else Any visit to Mumbai should include a stop at the majestic India Gate Peter Adams Getty Images Make your way straight to Mumbai Born and raised in Mumbai Meher Mirza has written about the city her entire life Indeed she cannot imagine living anywhere else â and always seeks to convert everyone else to her cause Reams have been written about Mumbai â s charms its colonial Gothic Indo Saracenic and Bombay Deco architecture its UNESCO certified monuments the amphitheater of the Queenâ s Necklace its sun scorched beaches its bazaars its temples mosques and dargahs churches and synagogues its restored art deco cinemas and the siren call of its Bollywood industry After all this is the City of Dreams But the Mumbai I love ferrets away its best bits â for example in the tiny East Indian and Goan hamlets of Khotachiwadi Ranwar and Matharpacady In Rajgriha which memorializes one of the worldâ s greatest minds the Dalit leader scholar and nation builder Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar In the Willy Wonkaâ esque shops like Davar Co which sell rows of brightly colored syrups and soft drinks In cultural festivals such as Mood Indigo thronged by indie rock and metal bands In Matungaâ s Tamilian cafÃ s which once helped support Carnatic musicians Delhi loves to brag about its history sure â but scratch a little deeper and you will find a Mumbai that once stood at the crossroads of antiquity The city is honeycombed with precolonial cave architecture â some monuments at last count â including the year old Buddhist Mandapeshwar caves Then there are the Jogeshwari Kanheri and Magathane caves I could go on At the Chhatrapati Shivaji Museum you might spot age dulled edicts statuary and stelae issued by Buddhist Hindu and Muslim rulers thousands of years ago Keep an eye out for Emperor Ashokaâ s year old edict etched in basalt pleading for liberalism and non violence from his citizens Bang in the center of bustling Malabar Hill youâ ll find the medieval Banganga Tank and temple complex All of these together stand as extraordinary testimony to the cityâ s palimpsest of religions and a record of the waxing and waning of ancient empires But what if you tire of the bedlam of car horns and concrete Delhi may have its manicured parks yes â but we have wild mangroves and riverways that seam through the city with flamingos and ibis and painted storks all flocking to our wetlands in winter We may be penned in by urbanization but fragments of forest still dot the city Sanjay Gandhi National Park naturally but also the Peru Baug hills the Dharavli Adivasi village and the IIT campus I also love Mumbai for its stone gray sea the lifeblood of Mumbaiâ s indigenous Koli fisher communities as well as a conduit for the cityâ s multiculturalism While sandy beaches abound I most love its ocean abutting now mildewed forts once imposing sentinels of the city Mumbaiâ s oceanfront location means its restaurants are famous for just caught seafood dishes Niharika Kulkarni NurPhoto via Getty Images Most of all I love it for its food Multiculturalism is inked in Mumbaiâ s very bloodstream kindling some tremendous culinary invention Start with the its doughty vada pao â the food of mill workers and the working class â and bhel a puffed riceâ andâ vegetable snack invented by footloose migrants from Uttar Pradesh or maybe Gujarat and which has since become a symbol Mumbai Then move on to Chinese dosa a jumble of spiced noodles spring onion cabbage and carrots enfolded in a dosa the sizzler distant kin to teppanyaki style cooking and Manchurian chicken pan fried with garlic ginger green chilis and soy sauce and purportedly invented by the Kolkata born Mumbai dwelling son of a Chinese immigrant Mumbai is home to singular Irani cafes too â establishments set up by century migrants from Iran that have long catered to a cosmopolitan crowd Hindus Muslims Parsis Jews and Christians of all classes Then thereâ s the superb seafood served straight off the boat Tiny crunchy mandeli fish eaten bones and all Crisp fried Bombay duck served on a pillow of semolina Delicate teesrya clams in a vivid coconut gravy Parsi style red pomfret curry and rice All are served at unassuming joints though Mumbai also has some truly world class restaurants where chefs and bartenders â no longer leashed by the constraints of tradition â serve up contemporary ingredient led versions of dishes that champion Indian fruit and vegetables Besides the city includes shops for every budget bopping nightlife and streets safe enough to walk in after a drink or two Why would anyone want to visit anywhere else Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real India Let a local expert craft your dream
