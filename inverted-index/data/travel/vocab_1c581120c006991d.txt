has travelled across the world leading photography workshops before settling in his favourite place eastern Canada s Prince Edward Island Discover his guide to the scenery sites and seafood that set it apart Dave Brosha is a passionate photographer educator explorer and writer who is proud to call Prince Edward Island home The island provides a great source of inspiration for his work Photograph by Amy Stackhouse By Samantha Lewis January min read Anticipation builds as you make the eight mile drive across Canada s longest bridge which links New Brunswick in mainland Canada to the country s smallest province Prince Edward Island PEI The island s red hue intensifies on approach the coastal cliffs rich in iron oxide tumble down to rust tinged sandy beaches During sunset and sunrise the landmass seems to glow upon the silky expanse of the Gulf of St Lawrence often frozen in winter Inland the scenery unfurls like a pastoral landscape with rolling hills blanketed in colourful swaths of lupins come summer It s a photographer s dream canvas and having lived there for more than a decade Dave Brosha knows precisely when and where to capture the island in its best light From May to August visitors can participate in Dave s photography workshops to see the island through his lens Still Dave insists Even if you re a complete amateur or taking photos on an iPhone the island is so beautiful there s a good chance your photographs will be amazing All you need is just to get outside and observe Admire the beauty of the red sandstone Cavendish Cliffs The rock formations are ever changing due to natural erosion and are a great place to capture dramatic photographs Photograph by Dave Brosha Much of Dave s childhood was enjoyed nearby in Nova Scotia However after spending many years in the Canadian Arctic photographing icebergs and polar bears he knew exactly where he wanted to put down roots I d visited Prince Edward Island many times on vacation so when I thought about where I wanted to settle the most beautiful place in the world seemed an obvious choice PEI at miles long and miles at its widest point is a huge contrast from the vastness of the Canadian Arctic but its diminutive size has its advantages One of the wonderful things about PEI s tiny land mass is that if you drive for minutes in any direction you find a different beach coastal cliff or lighthouse The island is famed for its exceptional seafood Charlottetown PEI s charming capital has a variety of excellent restaurants however Dave favours the eateries that lie a little off the beaten track In summer you might spot him on the terrace at one of his favourite restaurants such as Sou West Bar and Grill enjoying the views of New London Bay while feasting on Atlantic scallops or freshly shucked oysters Or you may catch him at one of the many fish restaurants in the north shore community of North Rustico tucking into seafood chowder made using the island s famous potatoes One way to immerse yourself in the island s culture is to wander around its open air markets and embrace the artistic vibe by exploring the many studios selling everything from pottery to paintings Two of Dave s favourites include Village Pottery and The Gallery which combines a coffee shop with the works of many local artists An image taken by Brosha of the night sky at Long Creek on Prince Edward Island Brosha has won awards for his astronomy photography Photograph by Dave Brosha The island hosts numerous cultural events with eclectic small festivals and ceilidhs held during the summer celebrating the island s Acadian Celtic and Mi kmaq heritage There s a strong Irish Scottish and French immigrant background reflected in the folk music here but there s also a wide variety of bands playing everything from hip hop to alternative rock which can be heard in the small halls churches and community centres While PEI doesn t have large wildlife such as moose bears or deer seen on the mainland Dave is passionate about photographing its foxes and he knows exactly where to find them I run several different workshops Some are wildlife workshops where I look for foxes and bald eagles whereas others focus on landscapes or astrophotography There s nothing more beautiful than capturing the Milky Way over a lighthouse at night he says singling out the New London Lighthouse as his most treasured of the lighthouses dotted around the island You can explore much of the island by cycling the mile Confederation Trail or hiking the mile Island Walk However Dave recommends appreciating the island s beauty at a gentler pace Take your time to witness the sunrise at locations like Borden Carleton paddle at Canoe Cove or go for a walk on one of the island s beaches renowned for their expansive red tidal flats When the water regresses it leaves beautiful tidal pools Because of the red rock when the evening sun begins to disappear or when the morning sun rises the water glows and the colours in the photographs project an incredible vibrancy and magical light Brosha loves to photograph foxes living on the island This shot was captured on Brackley Beach miles from Charlottetown Photograph by Dave Brosha The internationally acclaimed photographer continually tries to capture his home island from a fresh perspective So despite the overwhelming beauty of the colours found on PEI he s now producing a body of work in monochrome showcasing the island in a distinct way When you visit the island aim to follow Dave s advice and zoom in on some of PEI s lesser known spots where you can take the time to capture the island s breathtaking character and charm with your own unique angle Plan your trip There are flights from London and Edinburgh to Charlottetown Airport via Toronto Rent a car in Charlottetown for the duration of your stay as driving is the easiest way to explore the island s top attractions For more information visit tourismpei com This paid content
