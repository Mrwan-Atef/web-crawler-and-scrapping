do Margot Seeto Feb min read Share See San Francisco on a budget with these free local experiences Â georgeclerk Getty Images Taking up a small piece of real estate only miles wide and miles long space in San Francisco is at a premium which is partly why it is expensive to live here â and to visit However it is still possible to explore some of the best things San Francisco offers at no cost There are of course well known free things that every visitor loves to do like seeing the sea lions at Pier and browsing the City Lights bookstore both great ways to spend the day This list is more of a local s take on how we like to spend our days and not our money With these free activities you ll see a truer cross section of the people who live in San Francisco and get to experience local SF life for yourself Join the roller skaters in Golden Gate Park In the northeast corner of Golden Gate Park lies a treasure that not all visitors or even locals know about Skatinâ Place labeled as Ave

Skate â David J Miles who also founded Western Addition indoor roller rink Church of Wheels Advertisement A psychedelic roller skate ground mural was painted on the rink in and pays tribute to GGPâ s wild rollerskating days pre rink All ages levels and outfits are welcome Advanced skaters use the middle rink for solo and group roller dances Smaller kids use the northern tip of the oval to skate together in a quieter slower moving area Planning tip If you donâ t have your own skates the closest rentals are currently for rollerblades only from Unlimited Biking for hours mile southeast in the Lower Haight skate back to the park If you want to keep your Skatinâ Place visit free without the skate rentals almost just as fun is sitting on the bordering grassy areas to watch skaters whizz by with mesmerizing grace If you miss the Folsom Street Fair you can still learn more about the subculture at local events Â Nevskii Dmitrii Shutterstock Learn about BDSM culture in the Leather LGBTQ Cultural District The distinctly San Francisco Folsom Street Fair has been celebrating BDSM culture and educating the public about it for years in what is now the Leather LGBTQ Cultural District in SoMa Dog head masks nipple clamps black leather chest harnesses and lots of skin are the norm at this annual September festival Plenty of booths sell whips and ball gags if you accidentally left yours at home Folsom is a party where you can get consensually flogged publicly or just sip on a beer and munch on food truck eats while marinating in the scantily clad ambiance Admission is for those plus and is free though a suggested donation of goes toward public health nonprofits Be respectful of others as this is a community celebration and safe space Wear sunscreen and keep your reusable bottle full at the water filling stations as September is one of the sunniest months in SFâ s unique climate calendar Duck into one of the historic watering holes along Folsom for some shade like kink coffee shop Wicked Grounds or leather bar SF Eagle For those wanting something more intimate or hardcore look to private parties and smaller niche festivals that occur around Folsom time Local tip Year round the district sponsors events ranging from Erotic Storytelling Hour to monthly kink arts fests for Second Saturdays Hike â or bike â across the city via the Crosstown Trail After years of volunteer run planning the Crosstown Trail officially debuted in The feat is all in the name â it is possible to hike across San Francisco The ambitious mile trek is divided into five sections connecting a series of community gardens hidden trails public parks and tiled staircases It begins or ends in the southeast corner of the city in the Candlestick Park Recreation Area goes through Glen Canyon Park Golden Gate Heights Golden Gate Park and ends or begins in the northwest corner at Lands End For bikes alternate routes on nearby roads are given when encountering stair sections Thereâ s no signage and the trail isnâ t continuous but using the trail app the websiteâ s downloadable maps or downloadable route descriptions will assist with navigation including vital bathroom info Donâ t feel obligated to do the entire hike which has a very rough completion time of around hours Instead linger in neighborhoods more interesting to you or just focus on one or two from the get go Planning tip If doing the whole thing you ll need to take public transportation or a ride share if not biking from the finish as youâ ll end up on the opposite end of the city Don t forget to wear comfortable shoes that are good for multiple types of terrain Advertisement Follow trails or walk along the beach at windy Lands End Â Merrick Panes Shutterstock Stretch your legs walking to windblown Lands End Considered the rockiest wildest corner of San Francisco Lands End stretches from the northwest corner of the Outer Richmond to the luxurious northwest Sea Cliff neighborhood It has an eclectic and quirky collection of sights along its trails ranging from the ruins of Sutro Baths to World War II shipwrecks to a semi hidden heart sculpture made of beach rocks â all among century old windblown Monterey cypress trees and towering pines lining oceanside cliff trails You can make your visit short and sweet or long and moderately strenuous â both options are full experiences Lands End can also get windy so dress accordingly Take advantage of the Lands End Lookout by the main parking lot which has bathrooms water filling station and a gift shop Planning tip If you are still feeling energetic after your hike head a mile further south to the free Ocean Beach fire pits which are open during burn season from March through October Swing by the Safeway on La Playa on the way for firewood and snacks Be an early bloomer at the SF Flower Mart Countries like Japan have early morning fish markets that require a dawn entry for the best goods and most visually stunning experience In San Francisco thereâ s a better smelling equivalent at the San Francisco Flower Market Well almost The flower mart is one of those SF experiences that feels cool â itâ s not manicured and rooted like the gorgeous SF Botanical Garden it is its own floral beast with an industrial edge While industry badge holders looking to buy wholesale usually florists and designers can enter as early as the general public can enter for free Wednesdays through Saturdays from to With more than vendors selling farm fresh flowers ranging from a sea of fragrant purple orchids to colorful lei during graduation season the market also sells blooming plants greens silk products and floral supplies for flower enthusiasts dabblers or just the florally curious Go to gawk and smell the roses or make your own floral arrangements for special occasions like weddings or Motherâ s Day Thereâ s a designated parking lot on St at per every minutes Otherwise take Muni bus Muni metro line N or Caltrain Detour Grab a quick lunch afterward at Turtle Towerâ s St location a minute walk west Or walk minutes southeast to food truck parks SparkSocial or Parklab Gardens in Mission Bay Or if you need a pick me up walk minutes north to Delah Coffee SFâ s first Yemeni cafe for an aromatic Sanaâ ani house coffee with cardamom Avenue Tiled Steps were created as part of a community beautification project Â Wirestock Creators Shutterstock Clamber up the Avenue Tiled Steps There are more than public stairways in San Francisco but few are as gorgeous as our collection of tiled ones most of which are from artists Aileen Barr and Colette Crutcher The Avenue Tiled Steps at Moraga Street was their first tiled step collaboration completed in as a community beautification and unification project A theme of sea to stars unfolds as the stairs ascend Scenes from the ocean floor show seashells and colorful fish blending into browns and oranges of the earth section up to a bird filled blue sky a galaxy of iridescent stars and moon and finally a brilliant sun The view from the top reveals rows of Sunset District houses that lead to the grand Pacific Ocean Keep climbing another set of stairs behind you to reach Grandview Heights Park for what is indeed a grand view of the city from an even higher vantage point than the tiled steps About an minute walk north of Grandview gets you to the lesser known Hidden Garden Steps also along Ave between Kirkham and Lawton Its show stopping centerpiece is a brown salamander whose body curves with the steps it spans Both sets of steps are also part of the citywide Crosstown Trail see above Planning tip In the quiet residential Golden Gate Heights neighborhood street parking abounds but car break ins are common as the steps have grown in popularity Donâ t leave valuables in the car or travel there by bus â take Muni buses or See three innings of an SF Giants game for free The back of Oracle Park has a hidden spot for seeing three innings of an SF Giants baseball game for free The viewing point is inside Triples Alley whose gated back entrance is located on the Portwalk along McCovey Cove Thereâ s no signage for the viewing point not all park staff are familiar with it and thereâ s no early entry since the space is a pre game party area for box seat patrons You can only enter after the first pitch but you can hear the announcements music and national anthem while waiting to get in bring sun protection and water Once inside enjoy the coolness of the shade and relish feeling like part of a secret sports club Bring glasses if you need them or a pair of binoculars since the vantage point is in the outfield where youâ ll mostly see the backsides of players There is a railing to lean on but no seats If itâ s not crowded you can sometimes stay beyond three innings â the whole game even Just keep in mind that there are no bathrooms or food vendors here If youâ re of age you can duck into the Public House bar at the front of the stadium to watch the game on flat screen TVs Alternatively if you somehow know someone with a kayak or boat paddle out on McCovey Cove to absorb game ambiance with a tailgate party on the water Parking for Oracle Park is expensive the cheapest option is to book a spot a few blocks away on an app like SpotHero so consider taking Muni metro lines T or N or Caltrain Local tip For affordable eats in the area check out Taco Tuesdays Underdogs Cantina across from the park on King St or for a quicker bite chow down on a modern SF staple stationed outside the main stadium gates â bacon wrapped street cart hot dogs topped with jalapeÃ os and grilled onions for an inflated Find a spot on the grass in Dolores Park and enjoy the vibe Â Katherine Papera EyeEm Getty Images Spend the day people watching at Dolores Park No matter how you feel about the changing city and therefore Dolores Park and its symbol of Mission District gentrification people watching in this desirably sunny area never gets old From fire dancing to drum circles to acrobatics and DJ sets an eclectic mix of people can always be found at the grassy acre park Local Latino families international tech workers LGBTIQ folks from the nearby Castro and hipsters coexist in the name of relaxation and fun Informal food and drink vendors also rotate to keep things fresh from pizza to lumpia spring rolls to psychedelic mushroom chocolates and weed banana bread â Doloâ completed a renovation in with more open space picnic tables two sets of bathrooms and a cool playground for kids The park is easily accessible via the J Church Muni metro line and Muni
