Bahamas Hugh McNaughtan Jan min read Share A tangy tangle of conch onion tomato peppers Scotch bonnet chilis and citrus conch salad is always diced and tossed to order Â Â Getty Images iStockphoto Bahamian food blends African European and New World traditions to create an uncomplicated tongue tingling island cuisine Throw in superb local seafood tropical produce and rum based treats derived from centuries of Caribbean and North Atlantic sugar production and youâ ve got the ideal sustenance for exploring this emerald green subtropical archipelago Youâ ll find a standard repertoire of dishes repeated throughout the islands with small distinctive touches added by both roadside vendors and chefs working at beachside restaurants and high end resorts Freshness and unabashed flavor are the hallmarks of good Bahamian cooking and they can be found in every corner of the country Conch abound in Bahamian waters providing the islandsâ favorite source of protein Â Getty Images Cracked or chopped conch is Bahamian cuisine This muscular sea snail abounds in Bahamian waters providing the islandsâ favorite source of protein Tough and toothsome in their natural state they take on new dimensions in the hands of skilled cooks winkling them alive from their shells Advertisement Conch kÃ NGk salad a tangy tangle of conch meat onion tomato peppers Scotch bonnet chili lemon lime and orange is always diced and tossed to order Cracked conch â tenderized breaded and deep fried strips served with hot and tartar sauces â is equally beloved Where to try it Unassuming little harborside joint Stuartâ s Conch Stand in Bailey Town on North Bimini does fresh and fabulous conch salad Boring Boil fish is anything but More exciting than it sounds Bahamian boil fish stands or falls on the quality of its seafood Happily the fresh grouper and snapper that are ubiquitous around these islands find their way into this fish stew â often served for breakfast and especially popular at holidays and family celebrations Flapping fresh fish is seasoned with lime salt and pepper then added to a broth of onions potato and celery flavored with garlic thyme cloves and Scotch bonnets Once cooked the boil is served with cornmeal grits or golden pan baked Johnny cakes Where to try it If youâ re in luck Queen Conch on dreamy laidback Harbour Island will have this fish loverâ s treat on the menu Lobster lovers are spoiled for fresh catch Lobster means luxury and few places offer it as fresh and fantastic as the Bahamas The spiny lobster is abundant in Caribbean and North Atlantic waters making your chances of buying it fresh from fishing boats or finding it on menus deliciously high Unlike Maine lobsters this shellfish variety doesnâ t have large claws and typically delivers less meat but its firmness and natural flavors remain a must try Bahamian treat Often served simply barbecued subtly curried or sautÃ ed with onions and peppers itâ s fished from August to March Where to try it The century grandeur of Nassauâ s Graycliff Hotel complements this luxury dish to perfection Start your day with a steaming cup of souse Unglamorous souse â a stew of chicken wings or sheep tongue with onion potato carrots celery and peppers flavored with bay garlic and cloves â is a true Bahamian staple Nassau workers waiting for their morning jitney often grab a steaming cup of this nourishing goodness with lime chili and fresh bread as standard accompaniments Advertisement Where to try it If you venture as far as Andros the biggest and wildest of the Bahamas Brigadierâ s â on the beach north of Andros Town â does souse right Guava duff is a Bahamian sweet sensation The fragrant rose centered guava native to the Bahamas is frequently used to make this locally loved cake Ripe fruit is steamed in a shortening greased dough to make an airy pudding best served with a rum or brandy butter sauce While duffâ s roots lie in the hearty puddings developed for the British climate tropical fruit and rum mark this version as a perfect Bahamian adaptation Where to try it Arthurâ s Bakery on Harbour Island is a good bet for traditional Bahamian cakes alongside croissants and key lime pie Hit the beach with a Bahamian brew So many beaches bars and beautiful Bahamian sunsets cry out for a relaxing beer Try a crisp Kalik lager from the Commonwealth Brewery on Nassau or for something different a refreshing low alcohol grapefruit radler from Bahamian Brewery on Grand Bahama Where to try it Margarita Villa Sandbar east of Lucaya on Grand Bahama is a perfect timber sided beach bar to enjoy a cool sundowner Slip into island life with the Bahamasâ favorite rum cocktails Like many Caribbean and North Atlantic nations the Bahamas has a way with rum based drinks Worth trying is the Bahama Mama â a glass of tropical joy comprising rum coconut rum fruit juices and grenadine all over ice The Goombay Smash invented in Miss Emilyâ s Blue Bee Bar on Green Turtle Cay in the Abacos blends four different rums with orange and pineapple juices and chunks of fresh fruit Where to try it Unpretentious and off the beaten track you really canâ t beat the Blue Bee Bar for a lazy rum cocktail in the evening Citrusy Switcha goes down like an evening offshore breeze Bahamian Switcha is basically just freshly made limeade Its point of difference is the key limes â grown locally freshly squeezed and mixed with cane sugar and water Take your Switcha to the next level by adding Red Turtle vodka or pale rum from John Watlingâ s Distillery in Nassau Where to try it Rum Runners in Port Lucaya Marketplace Grand Bahama is a happy bustling bar that can rustle up a Switcha with something extra in it Nowhere in the Bahamas slings more sky juice in a more celebratory setting than Nassauâ s nightly Fish Fry on Arawak Cay Â Shutterstock Sky juice fuels every Bahamian party The uniquely Bahamian cocktail youâ re most likely to stumble across is the intriguingly named sky juice No doubt christened for its elevating effects itâ s a sweet celebratory concoction of gin green coconut water condensed milk and a scrape of nutmeg Where to try it Nowhere in the Bahamas slings more sky juice in a more celebratory setting than Nassauâ s nightly Fish Fry on Arawak Cay Vegetarians and vegans While not an especially carnivorous cuisine Bahamian food doesnâ t focus on catering to plant based diets Staples such as grits cornmeal porridge stewed greens bread and fresh tropical fruit and vegetables are however ubiquitous Side dishes like coleslaw rice and peas and mac n cheese are also never hard to find With more than Rastafarians also calling the Bahamas home seeking out Rastafarian restaurants is also a great way to explore vegetarian cuisine Resorts and international style restaurants will of course always cater to vegans and vegetarians Where to try it NRG Bahamas short for Nutrition Ready To Go is a smoothie juice and health food restaurant and store with locations in Cable Beach Old Fort Bay and on Gladstone Road Select locations serve breakfast but youâ ll also find a tempting selection of smoothie bowls salads sandwiches and a canâ t miss conch chowder Discover award winning food and spirits at culinary festivals The Bahamas hosts several large scale events focused on all things food and beverage from celebrations of the Andros crab a
