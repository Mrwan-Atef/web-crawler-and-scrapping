lessons Benjamin Franklin taught me about traveling well TRAVEL lessons Benjamin Franklin taught me about traveling well The most widely traveled American of his time the founding father learned a thing or two along the way American statesman Benjamin Franklin crossed the Atlantic eight times in his long life This circa print shows the Founding Father arriving in France Image Courtesy Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress Washington DC By Eric Weiner July As a young boy growing up in Boston Ben Franklin liked to loiter at the local harbor He d watch the arriving ships chat with the sailors and dream of joining their ranks That dream never materialized but Franklin an American founder groundbreaking scientist statesman and writer did go far He was the most widely traveled American of his time logging miles over the course of his long life He died at age He crossed the Atlantic eight times As deputy postmaster he traveled the entire length of the Northeast He spent a third of his life abroad living in London and Paris and visiting Canada Ireland Scotland Germany the Netherlands and for three glorious days the Portuguese island of Madeira Travel enabled him to cast his gaze beyond Puritan Boston and imagine fresh possibilities What advice might the peripatetic founder offer us modern day travelers Here are five lessons culled from Franklin s writing and his life and which I explore in my new book Ben Me In Search of a Founder s Formula for a Long and Useful Life Movement stirs the imagination In one of the many contradictions that defined Franklin travel enabled this most restless of souls to pause and think He did some of his best writing and experimenting while on the road or at sea It was on a bumpy carriage ride from Philadelphia to Albany New York in when he composed his brilliant and prescient plan for colonial unity It was on an Atlantic crossing to London in when he wrote his famous Father Abraham s Speech later retitled The Way to Wealth On another Atlantic crossing to Philadelphia in Franklin s opposition to British rule gelled and at age he became a fervent American rebel Scientist signer of the Declaration of Independence writer Benjamin Franklin was a polymath whose travels fed his creative energy Image Courtesy Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress Washington DC Franklin joins a long list of creative people who found inspiration on the road from Charles Dickens to J K Rowling There is something about movement that stirs the imagination As the Swiss philosopher and Franklin contemporary Jean Jacques Rousseau said I can scarcely think when I remain still my body must be in motion to make my mind active So next time you leave home bring a notebook and pen You never know what ideas might arrive unbidden He was a Founding Father His son sided with the British All great travelers are great actors On the road far from family and expectations we feel lighter and free to play different roles No one knew this better than Benjamin Franklin He slipped in and out of character as effortlessly as Tom Hanks In London he played the part of the proper English gentleman in France wigless and wearing a marten fur cap he transformed himself into the folksy backwoodsman philosopher The French ate it up Franklin knew he was playacting wearing sundry masks and winks at us while doing so He was what the philosopher Alan Watts called a genuine fake Genuine fakes are not con artists and they are not deluded Genuine fakes so fully inhabit their role their role s there is no distance between part and person mask and face Next time you re on a journey try on a mask or two What do you have to lose Improvisation can rescue a journey Franklin was an accomplished swimmer at a time when few people not even sailors could stay afloat He swam in Boston s Charles River and later in London s Thames and Paris s Seine He plunged into other kinds of unfamiliar waters too He took chances while traveling and embarked on journeys when the outcome was far from certain When he ran away from home at age he had no idea what awaited him in New York or Philadelphia In he traveled to London for what he thought would be a six month assignment He ended up staying for years Later when the ship carrying him to France encountered uncooperative winds and couldn t dock Franklin commandeered a fishing boat to take him ashore When leaving France eight years later and too sick to make the carriage ride from Paris to the seaside town of Le Havre he convinced the French queen Marie Antoinette to lend him her personal litter As a traveler Franklin made plans he was a methodical person after all but always remained flexible He was a master of improvisation one of the key tools in any traveler s kit Not all destinations are equally good As a young man Franklin drew up a list of virtues he intended to follow One was sincerity or honesty And that he was especially when it came to travel He was finicky He knew what he liked and what he didn t Had Tripadvisor existed then he would have been every hotelier s worst nightmare In France he chastised innkeepers for poor service In England he described a Portsmouth hotel as a wretched inn where even the stationery was shoddy He called the town of Gravesend a cursed biting place whose inhabitants expertly relieved travelers of their money In Benjamin Franklin presented the concerns of the American colonists before a council of British lords at Whitehall Chapel in London He lived and worked in London for years Image Courtesy Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress Washington DC Yet when he liked a place he was equally vocal During a six week visit to Scotland he experienced the densest happiness of his life On a trip to France in he effused about the beauty of Versailles The range of building is immense the garden front most magnificent the number of statues figures urns in marble and bronze of exquisite workmanship is beyond conception Franklin knew that travel demands discernment not all destinations are equally good and that to love every place is to love no place His advice Call them as you see them Bad trips can turn into great ones We ve all had bad trips journeys where despite our best planning and intentions everything goes wrong Franklin had his share of bad trips too an ill fated journey to Montreal at age nearly killed him but he didn t fret or sulk about them He converted them into something useful fodder for one of his many essays perhaps or a good tale to tell friends over a glass of Madeira Why bad trips can make for great stories One bad journey proved transformational Only years old Ben was sailing from London to Philadelphia The ocean crossing was plagued from the beginning At one point a shark circled the ship forcing Ben to skip his daily swim Onboard a card cheat was uncovered as well as a reckless cook who depleted their food reserves The winds blew infrequently or when they did from the wrong direction A journey that should have taken four weeks took With time on his hands though Franklin decided to reform himself He devised a Plan of Conduct and vowed that henceforth I may live in all respects like a rational creature His plan consisted of four simple rules Pay what you owe Say what you mean Focus on what matters Treat people kindly Franklin had departed London one person and arrived in Philadelphia another He knew that every bad journey contains the seeds of a very good one Eric Weiner is a former international
