Sep min read Share Cruising the highways in an expensive rental isn t the only way to get around in California Â Peathegee Inc Getty Images It s become an iconic image of travel in the United States â a red convertible with the top down cruising such classic California thoroughfares as the Pacific Coast Highway or across the Golden Gate Bridge California seems synonymous with cars â and rentals are readily available â but you can easily get around without touching a steering wheel using the many plane train bus and public transportation options Here s how to find your way around in the Golden State Flights save time and are priced competitively Major airports in Southern California are Los Angeles International Airport LAX Hollywood Burbank Airport BUR and San Diego International Airport In Northern California the major airports are San Francisco International Airport SFO Oakland International Airport and San Jose International Airport in the Bay Area and Sacramento International Airport in the Central Valley There are numerous smaller regional airports throughout the state Alaska American Delta and United all offer service across California through mainline flights and their commuter affiliates JetBlue and Southwest also have comprehensive networks of California flights Avelo offers discount flights from its hub at BUR to smaller California airports including Sonoma County Airport which is ideal for the Wine Country The air corridor between the Bay Areaâ s airports and those in Southern California is one of the worldâ s busiest With all the air service in the state fares stay low and competitive However itâ s worth remembering that getting between the two halves of the state by land can be more than half the fun of a visit so only fly if youâ re pressed for time Skipping a flight in favor of a train or the bus is also much better for the environment Advertisement Union Station in LA is a major transportation hub Â Kit Leong Shutterstock Take the train to revel in Californiaâ s beauty Amtrak operates a fairly extensive rail system in California There are long distance trains that connect the state with other parts of the US and regional trains which provide more frequent local services Besides trains Amtrak operates a network of Thruway buses that link certain train stations to popular destinations that lack direct train services such as Santa Cruz Carmel Monterey and Yosemite National Park There are three networks of regional trains covering California Amtrak has three local networks of trains in California that it operates with the state and local transportation authorities There are several trains daily on each of these routes The double deck coaches have large windows snack bars and wi fi Fares are cheap and usually fixed although itâ s possible to use these networks as a connection to longer journeys on long distance trains â Capitol Corridor This train links San Francisco â s East Bay including Oakland Emeryville and Berkeley and San Jose with Davis and Sacramento several times daily Thruway buses connect west to San Francisco north to Auburn in the Gold Country and east to Truckee and Reno Nevada Transfer to BART trains in Richmond for fast connections to Berkeley San Francisco and SFO â San Joaquin Running between Bakersfield and Fresno in the Central Valley and Oakland or Sacramento the San Joaquin has Thruway bus connections to San Francisco LA Palm Springs and Yosemite National Park â Pacific Surfliner This is a busy network of trains that run from San Diego in the south via LA to as far north as San Luis Obispo Many parts of the route feature superb coastal scenery Stops include San Diego s North County beach towns Orange County s San Juan Capistrano and Anaheim home of Disneyland and Burbank Ventura Carpinteria and lovely Santa Barbara In addition to Amtrakâ s regional trains there are two commuter train networks in California that are very useful to visitors Caltrain in the Bay Area and Metro Rail in Southern California Some long distance trains have useful stops in California Amtrak has four routes that link California to other states usually running once a day in each direction Each one makes a few useful stops within California for people not traveling interstate As always the best fares sell out first â California Zephyr This is a spectacular journey through the Sierras that follows the route of the original transcontinental railroad in California Nevada and Utah Stops in California include Sacramento and Auburn â Coast Starlight One of the worldâ s most beautiful train rides between the Bay Area and LA the Coast Starlight lives up to its name by running along some stunning stretches right on the ocean Tickets can include a bus connection into downtown San Francisco from the stop in Emeryville Other California stops include Redding Sacramento San Jose Salinas San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara â Southwest Chief Following the route of the famous Super Chief a train that traveled between Los Angeles and Chicago in the glory days of rail travel in the and the Southwest Chief s daily run passes through the Mojave Desert Californian stops include Barstow and Needles â Sunset Limited Running close to the Mexican border three times weekly linking LA and New Orleans this train can get you to Palm Springs Taking the bus is an excellent budget friendly way to get around California Â Getty Images Save money and take the long distance bus Besides Amtrakâ s highly useful Thruway buses mentioned above Greyhound operates buses over longer distances that generally follow the major interstate highways as well as Hwy between San Francisco and Los Angeles Flixbus also operates regional buses around the state Buses offer wi fi charging points and on board restrooms Advertisement Public transportation is reliable in cities and towns Almost all cities and larger towns in California have reliable local bus systems average to per ride Buses are usually the cheapest and slowest option but you ll typically find extensive metro area networks around big cities In San Diego for example municipal trolleys operate on three lines as far south as the Mexican border A few cities and regions have trains and light rail as part of their public transit offerings â Northern California Caltrain runs high frequency commuter trains from San Francisco south along the Peninsula via Palo Alto and Mountain View to San Jose and on to Gilroy BART Bay Area Rapid Transit is a fast network of trains that link San Francisco with cities across the East Bay including Oakland and Berkeley as well as the airports in San Francisco and Oakland â Southern California Metrolink is a sprawling network of seven commuter rail lines that fan out from Los Angeles Stops of interest to visitors include Burbankâ s airport and Anaheim in Orange County for Disneyland The related Metro network includes two subway lines four light rail lines and a variety of bus lines Major stops are Hollywood Santa Monica Venice and LAX Find your way with org org is an essential state funded service with information on all things transportation related in California It has a website apps and a phone service you can use to get details on anything from road conditions to bus and train schedules A rental car gives flexibility but also comes with challenges Californiaâ s love affair with cars runs deep for at least one practical reason the state is so big that youâ ll want the convenience and flexibility of your own wheels if you want to see a lot of it Certainly this applies to some of Californiaâ s top sights such as the Pacific Coast Highway Hwy along the coast between the Oregon border and Southern California as well as many of the beautiful mountain roads across the Sierras the deserts and the far north Then again when youâ re staying in San Francisco the last thing youâ ll want is to be saddled with the myriad hassles of a vehicle To rent your own wheels youâ ll typically need to be at least years old hold a valid driverâ s license and have a major credit card not a debit or ATM card A few companies may rent to drivers aged over but under but there will likely be a hefty surcharge Car rental rates can be high even for a generic sub compact If you want to go green with a hybrid or electric car you will pay for it And if you have to ask the price of a convertible so you can live the fantasy of cruising Hwy with the top down even on a day when the ubiquitous fog has temps in the then you canâ t afford it When comparing rates itâ s always worth checking whatâ s on offer from small indie outfits even if reaching the rental lot requires a long ride on a shuttle bus Your driver s license from home allows you to drive in California for a year Visitors may legally drive a car in California for up to months with their home driverâ s license If youâ re from overseas an International Driving Permit IDP will have more credibility with traffic police and simplify the car rental process especially if your license doesnâ t have a photo or isnâ t written in English To ride a motorcycle youâ ll need a valid US state motorcycle license or a specially endorsed IDP International automobile associations can issue IDPs valid for one year for a fee Always carry your home license together with the IDP You will need liability insurance California law requires liability insurance for all vehicles When renting a car check your auto insurance policy from home or your travel insurance policy to see if youâ re already covered If not expect to pay to per day for an insurance package Itâ s always worth checking to see if your auto insurance policy at home or your credit card provides insurance coverage so you can avoid the rental agencyâ s pricey policy Parking in Californian cities can be tricky and costly Parking is usually plentiful and free in small towns and rural areas but often scarce and or expensive in cities When parking on the street read all posted regulations and restrictions e g street cleaning hours permit only residential areas Pay attention to colored curbs or you may be ticketed and towed Municipal parking meters and sidewalk pay stations may take coins credit cards and or payment via apps Downtown and hotel parking garages in San Francisco and LA can cost to per day Combine travel and accommodation costs with an RV rental Â Alex Eggermont Getty Images RVs are expensive to rent but save you money in other ways Long a standby of family summer vacations and retirees in the US recreational vehicles might be expensive to rent but they combine transportation accommodation and cooking needs in one fell swoop Itâ s easy to find RV campgrounds across California with electricity and water hookups Whatâ s not easy to do is find a reservation to camp at one of the more sought after state and national parks due to surging popularity Your ability to roam at will stopping where the spirit moves you will be dependent on how many others have the same idea You may need to lock in much of your trip by booking camping reservations months in advance However if youâ re willing to go to more obscure corners of the Golden State you might just enjoy total roaming freedom Book RVs as far in advance as possible Rental costs vary by size and model but you can expect to pay more than per day Rates often donâ t include mileage bedding or kitchen kits vehicle prep fees or taxes If pets are allowed a surcharge may apply Also note that Californiaâ s homeless crisis has many people living in older RVs parked along the streets in urban areas There are laws that discourage this which can affect the unsuspecting visitor looking for a place to park for the night Taxis are available throughout California Taxis and ride hailing services like Uber and Lyft can be found throughout the state Rates are not inexpensive Sail between ports on a ferry Boats wonâ t get you around California although there are a few offshore routes notably to Catalina Island off the coast of Los Angeles and Orange County and to Channel Islands National Park from Ventura or Oxnard northwest of LA heading toward Santa Barbara On San Francisco Bay a comprehensive ferry network operates between San Francisco and Sausalito Larkspur Tiburon Angel Island Oakland Alameda and Vallejo The views from these boats are fabulous Many national and state parks have wheelchair accessible pavements or boardwalks Â JLPH Getty Images Accessible transportation in California California is reasonably well equipped for travelers with disabilities Most intersections have dropped curbs and some have audible signals for people crossing the streets The Americans with Disabilities Act ADA requires public buildings including airports train stations bus stops and restrooms built after to be wheelchair accessible Motels and hotels built after must have at least one ADA compliant accessible room state your specific needs when making reservations Most national and many California state parks and other outdoor recreation areas offer paved or boardwalk style nature trails accessible to wheelchairs For longer distances all airlines trains and buses can accommodate people with disabilities although there may be a requirement for hours advance notice Public transportation networks have buses trams and trains that are accessible without advance notice Legitimate service animals can accompany their owners on all forms of transport For information on accessible public transportation in California use
