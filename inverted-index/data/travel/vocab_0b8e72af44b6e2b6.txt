read Share From free activities to budget meals these top tips can help you save money when you visit England Â Photo by Roo Lewis Getty Images From cliff backed beaches and quaint villages to vibrant cities and historic sights England has plenty to entice visitors But it can also be a fairly expensive destination particularly in terms of accommodations tours and sightseeing The good news Many of Englandâ s museums natural sights and heritage attractions are free Public transportation can be affordable when planned in advance and plenty of wallet friendly dining options exist from pub lunches to the iconic takeaway fish and chips Even London famously one of Europeâ s most expensive cities can be explored on a budget if youâ re careful Outside of the major tourist destinations the rest of England becomes much more affordable so heading off the beaten path can be particularly rewarding Get ready to explore the land of rolling countryside ancient castles and dazzling white cliffs with these top money saving tips and a guide to daily costs Expect to pay around Â for a takeout portion of fish and chips Â creacart Getty Images Average daily costs in England Hostel room Â dorm bed

significantly across England depending on the destination Prices in London and other popular cities are generally much higher than in smaller towns or rural areas Figure out which London airport is the cheapest to fly to London has six major airports but transport costs into the city center â or further afield â can vary widely To figure out which airport is cheapest to fly to in England you should factor in the onward travel costs to your final destination Heathrow Londonâ s main and busiest airport is on the London Underground s Piccadilly Line and the new Elizabeth Line so travel into central London can cost as little as Â Buses from Heathrow Central Bus Station can provide affordable onward travel to the rest of England The second largest airport Gatwick competes directly with Heathrow for a number of destinations often resulting in lower flight prices Itâ s not on the London Underground but there is a train station and a bus station with connections into central London starting from Â and Â respectively There are also good connections with other parts of England particularly the south Londonâ s Luton Southend and Stansted airports are popular hubs for budget airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair though they have a longer journey time into central London Finally the centrally located London City Airport is usually the most expensive to fly to but allows for cheap and convenient onward travel within the city center For the cheapest train tickets book up to weeks in advance of travel Â Peter Muller Getty Images Remember to check other destination airports Depending on your onward travel plans flying into London might not be your best bet Manchester Airport is the third biggest in the UK and has flight connections with over destinations worldwide As with Heathrow and Gatwick the amount of flight options can drive competition between airlines and result in lower prices Smaller airports throughout England may be better positioned for onward travel to other parts of the country Bristol and Newquay airports are much closer to Southwest England than the London airports for example while Birmingham Airport might be a better option for the Midlands Remember to factor in the price of onward travel as this can have a huge impact on travel costs If you want to visit the Lake District trains from London Heathrow to Oxenholme train station take almost hours and start from Â Trains from Manchester Airport to Oxenholme by comparison take and start from Â If youâ re trying to get the best flight deal possible itâ s a good idea to widen your search to include all English airports and to check the onward travel options before making your decision Weigh up your transport options Unfortunately public transportation isnâ t always the cheapest or most practical way of getting around England Most cities and towns have good internal bus networks but many rural areas and small towns have limited â or no â public transport services and trains between cities can be pricey Train tickets are notoriously expensive in England but traveling off peak and booking around weeks in advance can dramatically reduce costs Check and compare train times and ticket options on National Rail If you plan on traveling by train regularly purchasing a National Rail annual railcard may help reduce costs The best way to travel around England for budget visitors is by coach but journey times are often much longer than by train or car and the routes arenâ t always convenient Bus travel is cheapest when booked direct the two main operators are National Express and Megabus Both offer competitive prices Advertisement If you plan on visiting multiple destinations or traveling to parts of England with limited public transport services driving may prove the most practical way to get around According to Kayak car hire in the UK is Â per day on average although prices can be as low as Â per day Book transport in advance for the best deals If you plan to travel around England via public transport booking in advance is almost always the cheapest option Advance train tickets can be around cheaper while Trainline claims its customers save an average of when booking in advance Train tickets can usually be booked around weeks before the departure date while bus tickets from National Express â the UKâ s largest coach operator â go on sale up to one year in advance Find free parking Park Ride services on the outskirts of towns and cities usually offer free parking when you pay for the bus into the center This usually works out much cheaper than paying for city center parking not to mention congestion fees which are becoming increasingly common in busy cities Street parking where allowed is often free in England though sometimes only for a limited time and rarely in city or town centers Apps like AppyParking and Parkopedia can help you find free places to park Visit in spring or autumn for the best prices June to August is the peak tourist season in the UK Travel costs especially accommodation can rise dramatically during these months as well as during school and public holidays The shoulder seasons of April to May and September to October are often much quieter and cheaper times to visit The weather is usually fairly mild though changeable and with a greater chance of rain than in summer November to March is the off season in England and is generally the cheapest time to visit except Christmas Itâ s worth noting that many outdoor and summer based tourist attractions close during winter especially in seaside resorts Prices go up and availability goes down in the school holidays but it s still free to spend time on the beach Â SolStock Getty Images Avoid traveling during school and bank holidays School and public holidays are the most popular travel times in England and tend to see significant price increases To save money avoid traveling during school holidays which happen every six to seven weeks if you can The exact dates vary across the country but generally speaking the longest holiday period is from the end of July and throughout August with an additional two weeks around Christmas and Easter There are also half term holidays of one or two weeks usually falling in February May and October Additionally there are eight Bank Holidays in England throughout the year Extra holidays are sometimes added for national events such as Royal weddings and funerals Make the most of Englandâ s free attractions If youâ re exploring England on a budget there are plentiful free attractions to enjoy All national parks have free entry as do most other natural attractions such as woodlands country parks lakes and beaches Likewise there are miles of public footpaths bridleways and long distance walking and biking paths to enjoy free of charge across the country Many museums and art galleries offer free entry and even the ones that donâ t often have a monthly free entry day Churches and cathedrals are usually free to explore as well although some ask for donations from visitors Get for on attractions with National Rail The National Rail Days Out scheme offers for tickets at over attractions in England when you travel by train Thereâ s a huge variety of attractions across the country including aquariums zoos football grounds museums gardens and cinemas Simply show your train ticket on entry to receive the discount National Trust and English Heritage memberships mean free access and free parking at many historic sites across England Â Ray Wise Getty Images Join English Heritage and or the National Trust Many of England s top heritage properties beauty spots and historic sites are managed by either the National Trust or English Heritage charities Stonehenge and Dover Castle are two of the most famous English Heritage sites while the National Trust manages over gardens nature reserves and historic houses such as Agatha Christieâ s former home Greenway House in Devon Both charities offer annual memberships allowing free entry to all attractions as well as free car parking at a number of locations Both charities also offer temporary memberships for short term visitors from overseas These can be well worth purchasing if you plan on visiting several attractions Look for discounts for students seniors groups and families Many attractions throughout England offer discounts to students children usually under and seniors usually Some also offer cheaper packages for groups and families so check the best options online when planning your trip Check online for discounts Coupons and special offers are popular in England If youâ re visiting an attraction or a restaurant check its social media pages for any current deals that may be running Likewise local Facebook Groups and newspapers can be good sources for news of special offers and discounts in the area You can also sign up for online deals websites to find discounts on days out meals and more Groupon and HotUKDeals are two popular websites for finding deals on UK travel Book rooms in budget hotels Accommodation can be one of the biggest costs when traveling in England The budget hotel chains Premier Inn Travelodge and Holiday Inn Express offer decent hotel rooms if a little bland at affordable prices Guesthouses and B Bs are usually cheaper than hotels and often have a lot more character Hotels on the outskirts of towns and cities can be cheaper than those in the city center but check that there are convenient public transport options before booking as taking taxis will quickly mitigate those savings Remember that hostels arenâ t just for backpackers The Youth Hostels Association YHA has hostels across England some of them in extraordinary buildings including castles These offer budget friendly dormitory accommodation for backpackers but there are many other options to suit all kinds of travelers Groups can book an entire dorm â or even the whole property â and many hostels have private and family sized rooms camping pitches cabins and even glamping Embrace the English caravan parks Holiday parks with static caravan accommodation are popular throughout England particularly around tourist hot spots on the coast or in the countryside These can be a very affordable option especially for groups or families although prices rise significantly during the summer holidays Many parks have facilities such as a pool restaurants shops and entertainment Pitchup is a handy website to search and book holiday parks caravans campsites and glamping sites across the UK Keep in mind that some holiday parks can only be booked directly through the parks themselves Look out for deals on dining out particularly weekday lunchtime set menus Â Hours Getty Images Enjoy a good meal out on a budget Englandâ s reputation for high prices and bad cuisine is somewhat undeserved Thereâ s good food to be found across the country from minimal mile menus at country pubs to excellent seafood along the ample coastline Food trucks are increasingly popular especially in cities and tourist towns and can be a great way to get a takeaway meal for less than Â Speaking of takeaways the famed British staple of fish and chips usually costs around Â best eaten on the beach at sunset for a no frills budget dinner For indoor dining pubs are generally cheaper than restaurants and many offer very good food alongside local ales ciders and other drinks Look for gastro pubs where the emphasis is more on dining than drinking Expect to pay around Â for a main and even less if thereâ s a deal on Consider signing up for a Tastecard You could also sign up for a Tastecard which offers dining discounts such as for meals at eateries all over the UK â including chains like Pizza Hut Prezzo and Giraffe Membership is Â a year so this is probably only worth it during a long term stay in England or if you plan to use the discount card a lot during your visit Stay in self catered places and shop in budget supermarkets Dining out is obviously going to eat into your budget Consider opting for self catering accommodation where you ve got the facilities to store and prepare your own meals The cheapest supermarkets are Aldi and Lidl although most supermarket brands usually have good special offers on Supermarkets are also great places to pick up cheap lunches many have a â meal dealâ combo of a sandwich side and drink or put together a picnic to take with you while youâ re exploring England Dine out on weekdays At pubs and restaurants weekdays are often the cheapest days to dine out During the week many establishments offer fixed price set menus or deals such as for mains that wonâ t be found on weekends Advertisement Advertisement
