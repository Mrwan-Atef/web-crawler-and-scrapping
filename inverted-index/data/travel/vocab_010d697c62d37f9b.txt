first editions clothing and the tiny desk on which Austen wrote her most beloved novels Sense and Sensibility Pride and Prejudice Mansfield Park Emma Northanger Abbey and Persuasion I was gobsmacked

her work including the BBC s Pride and Prejudice miniseries the film of Sense and Sensibility for which Emma Thompson won a Golden Globe accepting it with a speech as if written by Jane Austen

Day How to spend the day This is when our trip diverted from Austenland and into general Cotswold coolness First we stopped at Snowshill Manor and Garden built in the mid which can only be described as mental This National Trust property is more of a museum of curiosities than a stately home Its owner Charles Wade purchased the dilapidated property based on an advertisement in a magazine he read in the trenches during WWI Wade was a fanatic collector â of objects clothing clocks model ships furniture century samurai armor â and yes there are dolls He put on at home theatricals with elaborate
