to experience South Africa on a budget Mary Fitzpatrick Lucy Corne Sep min read Share Plan your spending in South Africa with this guide to daily costs along with top tips to help you save Â Marius Gerryts Getty Images South Africa â with its dramatic coastline wildlife filled parks vibrant cultures and cosmopolitan cities â can be within reach for travelers of all budgets The country has long had a reputation for being affordable Accommodations and food are particularly good value especially in the upper ranges of the market with prices at luxury hotels and restaurants considerably less than those at their European and North American counterparts Advertisement At the budget end of the spectrum expect good quality and standards at very reasonable prices At all levels your most significant outlays are likely to be for organized safaris and guided tours But even here with a bit of planning itâ s possible to find ways to keep costs manageable while still experiencing everything you hope to Plan your spending with this guide to daily costs along with top tips to help you save A beer at the bar in South Africa will set you back at least Â Klaus Vedfelt Getty Images Daily costs in South Africa Hostel room per dorm bed Basic room for two from Self catering apartment including Airbnb from Bus ticket Johannesburgâ Cape Town miles from one way Flight Johannesburgâ Cape Town from one way Coffee Bunny chow sandwich Dinner for two from excluding drinks Bottle of South African wine from Daily entry fee for Kruger National Park per adult child Daily entry fee for Mountain Zebra National Park per adult child Beer pint at the bar Average daily cost for three meals a day plus accommodations and activities from at the budget level up to or more for top end travel Johannesburg is the cheapest gateway airport for regional flights Johannesburg is an ideal port of entry if youâ re planning to include Kruger National Park or the Drakensberg area both an easy half dayâ s drive away in your travels or if you ll be combining your South Africa itinerary with visits to Lesotho eSwatini formerly Swaziland Botswana or other neighboring countries For international flights Cape Town is catching up with Johannesburg and fares are now roughly comparable between the two hubs so choose an entry point based on geographics and where you want to focus your explorations Hire a car with unlimited kilometers for the best deal Â Alistair Berg Getty Images Renting a car is the most cost effective way to explore the country Car hire is the best budget option for traveling around South Africa especially if youâ re traveling as a family or in a small group International and local rental agencies have branches at major South African hubs and many offer unlimited kilometers at reasonable rates â essential for keeping costs down while covering the country s large distances Advertisement Solo travelers or those who donâ t want to rent a vehicle should check out private shuttle services One popular company is BazBus which connects Cape Town with both Johannesburg and Gqeberha Port Elizabeth via the scenic Garden Route with both direct and hop on hop off options Bus is another possibility but suited mainly for point to point transfers between major towns Use ridesharing apps to get around urban areas Uber is generally regarded as safe and is less expensive than taxis Itâ s also a good choice for affordable transport between the airport and your hotel â look out for the signposted ridesharing app pick up zones Visit during the shoulder season to get the best deals Throughout South Africa prices are highest during the December to January summer holiday period and accommodations â including those within national parks â are often booked out well in advance February to May and September to November tend to be good months to visit in most provinces with fine weather lower prices and many areas to yourself Exceptions to this are the Easter holidays and big ticket events like Cape Townâ s Two Oceans Marathon in April In spring treat yourself to a profusion of jacarandas in Pretoria in October and an abundance of blue skies and sunshine almost everywhere while paying off season rates A self drive safari is cheaper than joining an organized tour Â Visual Outdoor Content Shutterstock Plan a do it yourself park visit instead of an organized safari South Africa offers some of southern Africaâ s best value wildlife watching and all major parks are geared towards independent travelers Self drive itineraries are easy and for those days when you do want a wildlife guide this can be easily arranged at park reception areas You can also save by camping or staying in park run accommodations all parks offer low season accommodation discounts and by self catering If youâ re traveling as a family or if youâ re planning on spending more than a week inside the major parks consider purchasing a SANParks Wild Card To trim costs even more remember that smaller or lesser known parks often have lower entry fees than their more famous counterparts Save by staying at hostels or backpacker accommodations Take advantage of cheap dorm beds kitchens for self catering bulletin boards with posts from those looking to find a group and plenty of links to reasonably priced local excursions Almost all hostels and hotels have discounts for children under and many hostels and backpacker establishments are also well suited for families with private rooms in addition to dorm beds Private rentals such as those arranged through Lekkeslaap Airbnb or similar engines can also bring significant savings especially for longer stays Visit South Africaâ s free and almost free attractions Small towns and off beat destinations will be lower priced than cities and tourism hot spots but itâ s possible to save even in major hubs In Cape Town for example Table Mountain can be visited less expensively if you hike up and down rather than taking the cable car You can then relax afterwards with a swim at the Campâ s Bay tidal pool or do some seal spotting from the Seapoint promenade In Durban soak up local vibes on a stroll along the boardwalk And in Johannesburg explore the city s many free museums finishing with a visit to the famous Apartheid Museum with its reasonable entry fee Almost anywhere you stay in South Africa will give you access to a braai barbecue pit Â shapecharge Getty Images Braai barbecue buy local produce and bring a refillable bottle The braai barbecue is a great South African tradition â one that spans cultures and provincial borders and all walks of life Itâ s rare to find a guesthouse apartment or homestay that doesnâ t have a braai pit in the backyard You could also picnic South African style by stocking up on provisions in the nearest town filling a cool box available for a few dollars at Checkers and other supermarket chains and heading out for a self catered holiday along the coast or at the national parks As you go donâ t forget to seek out South Africaâ s abundance of locally made products especially cheeses and wine which are often available at great prices Local tap water is generally safe to drink and carrying a refillable flask will help you save while avoiding contributing to the plastic bottle problem If you donâ t want to cook for yourself watch where locals go to eat to get the best deals Sidewalk food vendors are good when you can find them as are small local style restaurants selling traditional food Ask staff at your accommodation for tips about their favorite places to eat Claim back tax when you leave Save your receipts for souvenirs and other items to claim back South Africaâ s Value Added Tax when leaving the country Check out the details at the government s Vat Refund Agency page South Africa is a good place to splurge if you can While upmarket hotels can cost upwards of per night rates are generally well below those at equivalent establishments elsewhere in the world You ll experience similar levels of service often complemented by unbeatable views over the ocean or mountains Once youâ ve taken in the views make time to enjoy South Africa s world class cuisine The Cape Winelands and Johannesburg are just two locations known for their excellent dining options Throughout the country mains generally donâ t exceed while a
