Paella A Spanish culinary institution Photograph by Ant Duncan TRAVEL Paella A Spanish culinary institution From the ingredients to the execution the finer points of paella Spain s most famous dish are a matter for hot debate By Michael Raffael May min read This article was adapted from National Geographic Traveller UK I remember my favourite paella like it was yesterday Cooked over an open fire on the floor of Nuñez de Prado s olive oil mill in Baena The smoke infused bomba rice chicken and rabbit fried in unfiltered organic oil Saffron and pimentón added their inimitable perfumes It was everything it should be completely unpretentious but prepared with the choicest ingredients It sits in stark contrast to the renditions too often found in tourist resorts across Spain Gloopy custard yellow rice dotted with mussel shells and lazily defrosted prawns can only be a disappointment once you know the joys of real paella But how does one define real Pinning down what s genuine what isn t and what s a clever twist isn t straightforward Valencian purists who claim paella as their own insist that to be authentic it should include rabbit snails and the local garrofón beans which resemble a cross between a broad and a butter bean And when it comes to preparing their homegrown rice the Spanish have three basic techniques arròz caldós is almost soupy while arròz melós has a similar texture to risotto Paella belongs in the third group arròz seco dry rice a method that involves the grains absorbing moisture and flavours from the other ingredients with which they cook And every year Sueca a town close to the city of Valencia hosts a world championship to honour Valencian paella Rice and the rest Rice harvested around Valencia s Albufera National Park has the Spanish equivalent of the EU s Protected Designation of Origin Denominación de Origen DO And yet the region s two main varieties of rice aren t interchangeable while they re both short grained they absorb different amounts of water Bomba is more robust like a sponge it can soak up to three times its dry weight without bursting It s the relatively failsafe option Serious pros lean towards sénia It drinks less water but really absorbs flavour Cooking with it is a risky business though when overcooked the more fragile grains can turn pudding like For both varieties there are grades The best extra contains over perfect i e unbroken rice grains Allow per portion regardless of which type you re using it s the standard measure As for the other ingredients there s the official list accepted practice and freestyle The current authentic recipe numbers components rice chicken rabbit green beans garrafón olive oil tomato saffron salt and water And what of the caracoles snails They re no longer thought of as essential but cooks sometimes replace them with sprigs of rosemary Among the common sense additions pimentón deserves its place because it gives colour and added flavour It s also common to substitute water with chicken or vegetable stock This makes up for the younger meat we tend to use now which while tenderer produces less flavourful juices than the more mature chicken and rabbit that were once used For the same reason recipes often include a sofrito sweated onion and tomato although traditionalists frown on the addition of either onions or garlic Beyond the standard paella there are countless variations both locally and in the next door province of Murcia They split neatly into meat vegetable seafood and mixed a good palate allied to knowledge of the region s produce dictates what can or can t go into these One outraged chef accused Jamie Oliver s chorizo containing version of being criminal It may taste fine but it certainly doesn t pass muster with the purists The pan and method The meat seafood or vegetables can make or break a paella recipe The aim is to pack their flavours onto and into the rice and doing this isn t about quick sautéing The classic Valencian recipe involves preparing the dish over an open fire frying the pieces of chicken and rabbit first until they re no longer raw at the bone don t use fillets because the bones give extra taste Chopped tomato goes in next When it s evaporated to a pulp the beans join them in the pan They have to stew until they re almost done Then the pimentón if using water infused with saffron and salt are added Only when the smell tells the cook all the ingredients have blended does rice and water or stock go in The usual guide is three parts liquid to one of rice this works but be ready to add extra boiling water later if the paella is bubbling too fast Nobody should prepare paella with a stopwatch but controlling the heat affects the outcome For the first five or six minutes the pan should boil hard After that lower the heat and allow the contents to bubble gently for about minutes more As for the dish in which it s cooked really this has to be the shallow two handled frying pan that has lent its name to the dish It owes it design to dry Mediterranean Spain where wood for burning was in short supply Placed on a trivet over an open fire it offers a generous surface area to cook more food using less fuel The fire heats it evenly too so that the rice at the edges simmers at the same speed as in the centre According to Iberica Restaurants founder and owner Marcos Fernandez Pardo the best equipment for homemade paella is the barbecue Conventional gas or electric rings don t suit the thin gauge metal pans in Spanish markets because they don t spread the heat across the base Non stick or enamelled steel share the same problem Cast iron distributes heat better as do pans designed for induction hobs This is crucial because the rice has to cook everywhere at the same rate The pan s diameter dictates the quantity of rice and by extension the number of servings About for two for four and for six are rule of thumb sizes In terms of non rice quantities think of paella as a meal If you d sit down to one roast chicken for four people you want the equivalent amount of meat seafood or vegetables cooking in the rice Follow Published in Issue of National Geographic
