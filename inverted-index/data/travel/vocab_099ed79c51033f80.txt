intelligentsia bought country homes here in the More recently suburbanites and exurbanites bought or built year round houses eager to live in an area of relative peace and quiet within a long commute of New York and Philly Over the years Bucks County has been known for art colonies and antiques summer theater and country inns These days cookie cutter housing developments are planted where grain once grew It s not unusual to find suburban sprawl and hyper development adjacent to an old clapboard farmhouse or an ancient stone barn Yet many areas of Central and Upper Bucks County remain as
