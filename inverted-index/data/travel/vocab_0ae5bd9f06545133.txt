Angelo Zinna Feb min read Share Spiaggia della Pelosa is one of the most famous beaches in Sardinia Elio Villa Shutterstock Ferries and resorts fill up during summer when crowds reach Sardinia to make the most of its dreamy coastline But turquoise waters are just part of the allure Ancient traditions blend with diverse landscapes on Italy â s second island where stretches of fine sand and soaring cliffs surround a mountainous interior covered in Mediterranean scrub Whether you are planning a road trip a through hike or a tour in search of the hidden coves that dot the rugged coast keep these things in mind as you plan your Sardinian holiday Advertisement Carloforte town in isola di San Pietro in Sardinia Ana del Castillo Shutterstock Plan for at least a week to visit Stretching for approximately miles north to south Sardinia may appear small on the map but covering each province could take weeks if you want to see all the island has to offer From exploring the ruins left behind by the ancient Nuragic civilization to diving into marine reserves dotting the coast and visiting wineries in the hilly interior youâ ll feel rushed if you plan to squeeze everything in just a few days Take at least a full week to travel beyond the highlights and organize each leg of your itinerary in advance if you are visiting in the high season as many of the most popular destinations are likely to be fully booked months in advance Avoid crowds and high prices by traveling during the shoulder season Traveling to Sardinia in July and August means facing the infamous Italian peak holiday season â this is not just the hottest time of the year but also the period during which most Italians flock to the coast for their annual holidays Expect crowds and peak pricing on everything from ferry tickets to hotels and car rentals Visiting before or after the summer will make your trip to Sardinia much more enjoyable The island is sunny for much of the year and the swimming season can start as early as April and runs until October By avoiding peak summer months youâ ll also have access to affordable accommodation and the chance to move around spontaneously without too much planning Donâ t underestimate the heat The heat is not to be taken lightly Global warming is hitting Sardinia especially hard and record temperatures have been registered year after year â in late July of the eastern coast of the island surpassed C F with a high risk of forest fires affecting much of the dry interior Advertisement July and August are the warmest months If you are visiting during this time of the year itâ s best to avoid hiking or cycling in the middle of the day Needless to say always carry plenty of water Aerial view of boats along the cliff lined coast of east Sardinia in the Gulf of Orosei Shutterstock Fly or book a ferry to get to Sardinia Sardinia is well connected to mainland Italy and many European destinations thanks to three airports â Cagliari Olbia and Alghero â located on three corners of the island Cagliari Sardiniaâ s capital is the main entry point but Alghero has long functioned as Ryanairâ s main Sardinian airport offering frequent low cost flights year round Flying is not the only way of getting to Sardinia Ferries depart from the ports of Livorno and Piombino in Tuscany from Civitavecchia near Rome from Naples and from Palermo allowing you to take the slow trip across the Tyrrhenian Sea to Sardiniaâ s eastern coast Main operators include Moby Tirrenia Grandi Navi Veloci and Grimaldi Lines You may also continue onto Spain by taking the ferry connecting Porto Torres with Barcelona or by heading north to Corsica Driving is the best way of getting around but there is a shortage of rental cars Sardinia has a decent rail network and buses go where trains canâ t Yet traveling by public transport is slow and doesnâ t allow access to more remote areas where you ll find many of the islandâ s natural wonders Traveling to Sardinia by ferry means you can take your vehicle with you from mainland Italy Still itâ s worth comparing the prices of sea transport with those of car rentals especially if you are visiting in the high season when ships fill up and ticket prices increase significantly If you choose to rent a car on arrival during the high season book in advance In recent years Sardinia has experienced a shortage of car rentals due to a combination of the global ship shortages the effects of the pandemic on the local economy and the island s recent growing popularity Be ready to speak or listen to different languages Sardinia is not just geographically diverse itâ s also linguistically rich While Italian is spoken everywhere the local language is Sardinian a neo Latin tongue that has been officially recognized as one of Italyâ s minority languages and declared endangered by UNESCO But Sardinian is not the only language spoken by the million people living on the island â head northwest to the area of Alghero and youâ ll hear people speak a version of Catalan a remnant of Spanish domination in the and centuries Hiking the Supramonte mountains Frank Lambert Shutterstock Choose between wilderness or hyper luxury In the late a development project backed by a group of large foreign investors began transforming the rural area of Gallura into one of Italyâ s most luxurious holiday destinations The Costa Smeralda a mile stretch of coastline in the northeastern part of the island is now home to hotels where rooms cost thousands per night exclusive nightclubs and restaurants a yacht club golf courses and dreamy villas hosting international VIPs The publicity received by this corner of Sardinia often overshadows its wilder heart best experienced through long distance hikes that cross the islandâ s majestic landscapes Pack a tent and a sleeping bag to tackle multiday trails such as Selvaggio Blu considered one of Sardiniaâ s most challenging treks or the Grande Traversata del Supramonte running along the Supramonte mountain range in the eastern part of the island Take it slow and experience Sardinia on two wheels Bike tourists have long loved Sardinia for its low traffic and coastal roads This has become even more noticeable in recent years as large investments have been put toward improving existing cycling paths and creating new routes for travelers who enjoy exploring on two wheels Most cities now have bike rental services and the network of dedicated lanes is growing year after year allowing both locals and visitors to travel safely and sustainably at a slow pace Advertisement
