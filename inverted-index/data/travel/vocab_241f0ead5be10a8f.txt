Sandra Henriques Nov min read Share On this week long itinerary you ll hike dine swim and visit the historic whaling town of Sao Roque do Pico Shutterstock Sandra is an Azorean native who has researched and written the first Lonely Planet guide to the Azores Here she shares a one week itinerary for first timers to SÃ o Miguel Terceira and Pico I was born and raised on the Azores Islands and these are the questions people ask me the most Is it always raining Which islands should I visit The first one is easy itâ s not As for the second one sometimes answering involves me printing out a map of the archipelago marking spots with a pen and asking lots of follow up questions Advertisement This one week itinerary covers the three largest islands SÃ o Miguel Terceira and Pico Iâ m sure youâ ll want to return to explore the other six When to arrive The best time to visit the Azores is between June and August The weather is warmer itâ s beach season itâ s the best time for whale watching and youâ ll find more cultural events and festivals How to get to from the airports Driving is the best option to travel between the airports and the islandsâ main cities â public transit on the islands is hit and miss plus understanding each network is confusing and time consuming What to pack A light waterproof jacket is your best friend in the Azores Although it s not always raining the weather can shift quickly throughout the day In summer pack swimwear â there s always a spot for an ocean dip somewhere Planning tip To travel between islands optimize your time by choosing the earliest flights possible and the ones with the least layovers Research and book flights using the multi city option on Azores Airlines Day Start your Azores experience in SÃ o Miguel Most international flights land in Aeroporto JoÃ o Paulo II PDL on the largest island SÃ o Miguel I call it the â gateway islandâ a great way to ease into the Azores experience â not too remote to feel isolated but far enough from the mainland How to spend the day Day one calls for a slow start Explore the main city Ponta Delgada and get accustomed to urban life by the ocean Shake any jet lag or long flight drowsiness with a walk in the historic center Take in black and white pavements the deep blue Atlantic and the aroma of sea air Dinner A Tasca is a great place for your first taste of traditional Azorean cuisine with local fish served grilled Seeing the view of the beautiful lake of Sete Cidades is one of first things many visitors want to do Vicky SP Shutterstock Day Soak up postcard perfect views in Sete Cidades and Mosteiros Morning Hire a taxi or drive from Ponta Delgada to Sete Cidades miles Most travelers head straight to Miradouro da Vista do Rei for the views over the blue and green lakes â although stopping here is a must after seeing SÃ o Miguelâ s most famous landscape drive down the winding road that leads to the center of the quiet lakeside village Take a break Head to Casa de ChÃ O Poejo for a light lunch Weather permitting ask to pack your meal and have an impromptu picnic by the lake Afternoon One of the top beaches in SÃ o Miguel Praia dos Mosteiros is a drive from Sete Cidades A well known spot for experienced surfers it s also a family s favorite in the summers Whether it s a good day for a swim or relaxing by the shore stick around for the sunset Dinner Ponta Delgadaâ s artistic district O QuarteirÃ o has some of the best restaurants in town including the local institution Rotas da Ilha Verde one of the cityâ s first vegan and vegetarian restaurants Advertisement In the evening If you still have the energy wrap up your day with a cocktail at RÃ svÃ s Street Bar The PoÃ a da Dona Beija is a popular hot springs facility in Furnas featuring five therapeutic thermal pools Marija Krcadinac Shutterstock Day Spend a relaxing day in Furnas How to spend the day Start early and take the scenic road towards Furnas Itâ s a long and curvy trip approx miles so I suggest a stop mid way in Vila Franca do Campo to stretch your legs and see the islet from Miradouro IlhÃ u da Vila Take in the view but hit the road soon so you reach Furnas around mid morning Youâ ll want to explore the walking paths of Parque Terra Nostra and soak in their pool of naturally heated water and visit the caldeiras puddles of scalding water in the village center before lunch The shallow pools at PoÃ a da Dona Beija are safer for non swimmers Take a break After lunch whether you had the traditional cozido meat and potatoes stew cooked underground in volcanic steam or not stop by Padaria Moniz for coffee and get a few bolos lÃªvedos traditional Furnas sweet bread for the road Dinner Head to the fishing town Rabo de Peixe for an early dinner at Botequim AÃ oriano Planning tip For cozido das Furnas make reservations at least one week in advance Restaurante Tonyâ s is one of the best spots in town to try this local dish The Church in the historic center of Angra do HeroÃ smo RicardoTeixeiraFotografia Shutterstock Day Reach Terceira and walk around Angra do HeroÃ smo How to spend the day After landing on Terceira Island head straight to Angra do HeroÃ smo about miles from the airport Drop everything at the hotel and set out to get lost in the streets of the cityâ s historic center a UNESCO World Heritage Site since where colorful buildings line narrow cobblestoned streets and picturesque squares Depending on the weather either hike to Monte Brasil to see the views from Miradouro do Pico das Cruzinhas or learn about Terceiraâ s rich history at Museu de Angra do HeroÃ smo Take a break Grab a coffee or a glass of wine and unwind at cozy dog friendly family owned bookstore cafe and cultural venue Lar Doce Livro With a busy calendar you ll likely stumble upon some event with local artists Dinner You canâ t leave Terceira without trying alcatra stew in a clay pot Boca Negra is one of the best places to have it Day Take a road trip to some of the top sights of Terceira How to spend the day Drive from Angra do HeroÃ smo to Serra de Santa BÃ rbara Interpretation Center to learn about one of the volcanoes that formed Terceira Island Take in the views from Miradouro de Santa BÃ rbara and then head north to Biscoitos One of the busiest beach destinations in the summer this town is also known for its wine Dinner Drive along the coast to Praia da to grab dinner at O Pescador a traditional seaside restaurant known for fish dishes In the evening A post dinner walk along the promenade by the beach before driving back to Angra is a great way to start saying goodbye to Terceira The vineyards of Pico at CriaÃ Ã o Velha with Pico Mountain on the background Carlos S Pereira Shutterstock Day First day in Pico explore the islandâ s vineyards How to spend the day On a short trip you re unlikely to have time to climb Mount Pico it s at least an hour roundtrip You wonâ t be able to miss the mountain though Upon arriving and after a recognition walk in Madalena get to know Picoâ s wine industry history at Museu do Vinho Afterwards head to Porto da Areia Larga â the starting point of a hiking trail leading to the vineyards at CriaÃ Ã o Velha Take a break When walking back to Madalena stop by AtlÃ ntico Tea and Wine House for petiscos food to share and local wine by the glass Dinner Make reservations for one of the tasting menus paired with selected local wines served at Azores Wine Company â or choose one of the smaller menus with petiscos Day Visit historic whalersâ towns How to spend the day The whaling industry was a crucial source of income in the Azores and is strongest in Pico Head to one of the whalersâ towns SÃ o Roque through the scenic road EN to visit Museu da IndÃºstria Baleeira and see the view of SÃ o Jorge Island Then drive south to Lajes do Pico and if youâ re visiting during peak season book a half day afternoon whale watching tour with Futurismo
