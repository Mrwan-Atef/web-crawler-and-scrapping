Why now s the time to visit Canada s Campbell River the Salmon Capital of the World TRAVEL Why now s the time to visit Canada s Campbell River the Salmon Capital of the World Home to one of the world s greatest salmon migrations Campbell River lives up to its title as the Salmon Capital of the World offering travellers the rare chance to snorkel among thousands of chinook chum and coho To see the salmon in abundance it s far better to don a wetsuit and float down the shallow Campbell River from late July to September when the salmon run is taking place Photograph by Getty Images Steven Heap By Brendan Sainsbury April This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Bald eagles circle overhead black bears patrol the forested riverbank and harbour seals frolic in pools near the estuary mouth Imagine you re immersed in a fast flowing river face down with a mask and snorkel observing one of nature s greatest spectacles a chaotic maelstrom of fish racing towards you all possessed with a deep rooted instinct to fight the current and progress upstream This is Campbell River s annual salmon run an epic journey of hundreds of thousands of fish from the Pacific Ocean returning to their freshwater spawning grounds A fishing and lumber town on the east coast of Vancouver Island Campbell River is regularly touted as the Salmon Capital of the World Five species of the sleek ray finned fish pink coho chinook chum and sockeye frequent the local rivers where they congregate in mind boggling quantities during the summer and autumn spawning season In a bumper year by all accounts an estimated one million pink salmon were reported to have returned here after travelling thousands of miles across the Pacific Despite the numbers the chance of glimpsing these creatures in the open ocean is surprisingly slim To see them in abundance it s far better to don a wetsuit and float down the shallow Campbell River from late July to September when the salmon run is taking place Enabling visitors to witness this remarkable subaquatic event local dive shop Oceanfix organises self guided snorkelling tours during peak spawning season accessible to anyone with two hours to spare and a healthy curiosity for Mother Nature The snorkelling experience is both thrilling and epiphanic Visitors come back to the shop knowing that they ve experienced something they probably never will again says the owner of Oceanfix Dive Centre Stephen Neff Photograph by Oceanfix Dive Centre It s something you have to experience to truly comprehend says Stephen Neff owner and diving instructor at Oceanfix Being in the water with the salmon you don t just witness their journey you become part of it I remember one time I wasn t surrounded by hundreds but thousands of them a living surging current of determination As I floated downstream they parted around me utterly focused on their singular purpose It s one of the most extraordinary spectacles I ve ever seen and I ve explored some of the world s most incredible dive sites A native Vancouverite Stephen spent years working abroad in Switzerland the UK and China before moving back to British Columbia in I turned my hobby into a profession he says of his relocation to Campbell River and acquisition of Oceanfix I was in the corporate world but longed to be near the ocean somewhere where the nature was still intact and Campbell River has some of the world s best cold water diving Perched on Discovery Passage a nutrient rich strait between Vancouver Island and Quadra Island Campbell River thrives with marine life its waters power washed by fast moving currents The result A super sized ecosystem teeming with giant Pacific octopuses wolf eels towering bull kelp forests and dazzling carpets of red anemones One legendary oceanographer Jacques Cousteau ranked the area second only to the Red Sea as one of the world s top dive sites The route begins at a logging bridge on the Gold River Highway where wetsuit clad swimmers launch bravely into an underwater obstacle course of rocks fishing lines and fast moving aquatic life There are two main rules explains Stephen keep your head in the water to avoid the rocks and don t attempt to pick up any souvenirs The water can go quite quick he warns You don t need to be a strong swimmer but you do need to be able to swim It s definitely adventurous I ve had people come out of there and say it was exhilarating but I was terrified One journalist emerged with eyes the size of saucers Legendary oceanographer Jacques Cousteau ranked this area second only to the Red Sea as one of the world s top dive sites Photograph by Getty Images Moelyn Photos The question of how to balance conservation with tourism is complicated but despite the challenges Stephen remains relatively sanguine Low key and strictly seasonal snorkelling is said to have a minimal impact on the river s delicate ecosystem There are also several local initiatives says Stephen Take the Greenways Land Trust we collaborate with them supplying equipment and training some of their divers Visitors can also get involved with their Streamkeepers programme that monitors fish presence and helps environmental restoration in the river he explains First Nations communities are also reclaiming stewardship of these waters planting oxygenating eelgrass in the estuary which was destroyed over the years It s a catch but I do believe tourism has a positive influence he states When people come to Campbell River it finances other activities such as some of the farm trust funds organised by the city to replant the estuaries With no tourist income there would be no way to finance these projects Furthermore the snorkelling doesn t damage anything he adds It s only a couple of hundred people who do this with us per year and we re the only operator The experience is both thrilling and epiphanic Visitors come back to the shop knowing that they ve experienced something they probably never will again Stephen states A churning underwater roller coaster that will open your eyes to the beauty and fragility of Vancouver Island s natural elements How to do it The salmon snorkelling rental package at Oceanfix costs C per person and includes equipment hire as well as an onshore briefing Aided by the current the river float takes around minutes and covers a distance of around a mile It s worth visiting the nearby Quinsam River Hatchery first Published in the Coastal Collection by National Geographic Traveller UK To subscribe to National Geographic Traveller UK magazine click here
