is a must but the modern capital isnâ t the only part of Qatar worth a visit Â Maja Topcagic Stocksy United The pint sized nation of Qatar isnâ t technically a one city state but thereâ s no denying that Doha home to more than of Qatarâ s population is the main attraction Yet the countryâ s modern capital isnâ t the only corner of this Gulf nation thatâ s worth a visit Venture beyond Doha to discover the shiny new sister city Lusail and a pseudo tropical island escape or strike out into the desert to uncover glimpses of Qatarâ s pearling past and unexpected natural wonders Advertisement Hereâ s a quick guide to the best places for couples families or solo travelers to visit around Qatar Tap into Qatar s pulse in the capital of Doha Â Buena Vista Images Getty Images See the sights and dine out in Doha Dohaâ s rapid transformation from sleepy seaside settlement to glitzy Gulf capital is legendary As the cityâ s futuristic skyline continues to expand so too do reasons to visit with recent years welcoming the striking National Museum of Qatar the Qatar Olympic and Sports Museum and a gamut of international hotels with a new metro system making it easier to get around Get a taste of Dohaâ s early days â along with regional culinary specialties â at the fabulously atmospheric Souq Waqif and then stroll along the waterfront Corniche to admire city and Doha Bay views Marvel at the Museum of Islamic Art inside and out and seek out public art mosques and more in the Katara cultural village Lusail is home to some of Qatarâ s most striking architecture Â Shakeel Sha Getty Images Hop on the metro to visit Lusail Just miles north of downtown Doha and connected by metro Lusail feels like an extension of the capital But this coastal metropolis in the making is actually a city in its own right While still largely a construction zone Lusail is already home to some of Qatarâ s most striking architecture notably the nationâ s showpiece arena Lusail Stadium shaped like a traditional woven bowl and Katara Towers which integrates the traditional scimitar swords from the national seal into a pair of story towers housing two luxury hotels Youâ ll also find a marina with a pleasant promenade the high end Parisian inspired Place Vendome mall and more attractions in the making Advertisement With the first line on the Lusail Tram connected to the Doha Metro opened in Lusail is easier than ever to visit via public transport Families should save time for Banana Island Qatarâ s only offshore island of note Banana Island is just a minute catamaran ride from Doha This small crescent shaped isle is occupied entirely by the family friendly Banana Island Resort Doha by Anantara Stay in an underwater bungalow and you can almost imagine youâ re in the Maldives or visit for the day and enjoy the islandâ s peaceful palm studded strip of sand Day passes include boat transfers and credit to spend at the resortâ s restaurants and on watersports Uncover history at Al Zubarah and Al Jumail Most people know Al Zubarah for its Unesco listed fort but Al Zubarah Fort was named for the thriving pearling port that now lies in ruins between the fort and the sea after being abandoned in the early century While the ruins are currently closed to the public you can glimpse the townâ s crumbling foundations from the entrance to the handsomely restored fort About miles farther north turn off the main road to explore the deserted village of Jumail Founded in the century the coastal village was also abandoned following the economic boom ignited by Qatarâ s oil and gas industries Al Zubarah is a minute drive northwest of Doha It can be visited on an organized tour with the likes of Adventures but youâ ll need a car to get to Jumail The mangroves of Al Khor offer a completely different side to Qatar Â HasanZaidi Shutterstock History and nature meet in Al Khor An hourâ s drive north of Doha and accessible by public bus the small coastal city of Al Khor isnâ t much to look at but itâ s home to several attractions that make it worth a brief visit Chief among them are the three stone watchtowers that stand along the coast Built around the towers were used to monitor ships and guard access to the areaâ s main well Ain Hleetan which has also been preserved Just beyond Al Khor a boardwalk takes you through a lush mangrove nature reserve to Bin Ghannam Island also known as Purple Island where shell middens have revealed traces of human activity dating back to the millennium BC Farther north the village of Al Thakira is a launchpad for mangrove kayaking tours Hit the beach in northeastern Qatar The largely undeveloped and sparsely populated northeastern corner of Qatar offers a handful of attractions worth checking out if youâ re planning to rent a car beginning with the mysterious Al Jassasiya Rock Carvings near Al Maroona Beach also known as French Beach one of Qatarâ s most pleasant public beaches Farther north Fuwairit Beach is being developed as a kitesurfing destination Perched on Qatarâ s northeastern tip is Zulal Wellness Resort a luxe modern retreat guided by traditional Arabic and Islamic medicine and one of the few places to stay in the region The nearby port town of Al Ruwais lacks notable attractions but its Shamal Corniche is a scenic spot for a sunset stroll Explore desert oddities in Zekreet The small west coast village of Zekreet is the jumping off point for visiting the Brouq Peninsula also known as Bir Zekreet home to attractions including US artist Richard Serraâ s gigantic Eastâ West Westâ East installation which rises up between otherworldly rock formations You can also check out the Film City ghost town a recreation of a traditional village built for an Arabic TV series But tiny Zekreet miles from Doha has a couple of sights of its own including a restored historic mosque and Zekreet Fort thought to have been built in the late or early century Dismantled for reuse of the stone by local inhabitants the fortâ s foundations are all that remain Zekreet has a few simple places to eat but nowhere to stay Southern Qatar is ready for adventure The southernmost stop on the Doha Metro the small city of Al Wakrah has a pleasant seafront souq market selling everything from honey spices and dates to perfumes and souvenirs You can also take a stroll around the perimeter of the historic Al Wakra Fort but itâ s not currently open to the public From here you can take a bus or an Uber minutes south to Sealine Beach one of Qatarâ s most popular public beaches with several dive sites close to the shore The east coast road ends here and the towering sand dunes of southern Qatar begin Book an off road tour to Khor Al Adaid which takes you across mountains of sand to Qatarâ s â inland seaâ a scenic tidal embayment that marks Qatarâ s border with Saudi Arabia Similarly to northern Qatar southern Qatar is typically visited on a day trip from Doha However this region has several accommodation options including Sealine Beach Resort a lovely spot for couples and several rustic desert camps if linger Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere
