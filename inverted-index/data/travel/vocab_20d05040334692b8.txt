home What s one thing visitors shouldn t miss There s a to week concert series in the summer called BST Hyde Park which hosts great open air shows both during the day and at night The line ups each year are beyond impressive I saw the Rolling Stones and Duran Duran play a couple years ago Plus there s just a special atmosphere there Also for summer visitors Wimbledon tickets are worth checking

charges are often already included in the bill Read more Let us in on your favorite restaurants what makes them great I worked for a restaurant guide in London in my which was an exciting time for the London restaurant scene Twenty odd years later restaurants like the Ivy and Quaglino s are still very special and worth experiencing Chiltern Fire House is scene y and super fun and there s a nice little gastropub in Kensington called the Abingdon with an easy atmosphere perfect for drinks and or dinner I also recently had outstanding Japanese food at Roka Read more Are there any activities that are better done on weekends vs weekdays Borough Market is an absolute must It s one of London s oldest food markets and open every day except Sunday But the majority of vendors are there

subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews Mexico City Mexico contributions of bubbles A London must visit place We went there on a Sunday morning expect long lines but it is worth it We did take a guided tour which made the visit more focused on the main areas of the museum but an audio guide would be a great idea cheaper and also very informative A very pleasant surprise was that the main circular building inside the museum is now open to the public It used to be a library and long time ago many famous characters used to be regular visitors to the library Do not skip this area you might see this very impresive place and also some desks dedicated to this visitors To have lunch you have options inside the museum I strongly suuggest the Great Court Restaurant located at the top floor of the museum Great food and a delughtful afternoon tea served at this location Read more Review of The British Museum Written

beautiful and full of history The inside is grand and impressive especially when you see the guards in their traditional red uniforms and bearskin hats marched in perfect rhythm We enjoyed watching the Changing of the Guard ceremony it was fun and very well organized Outside the palace the front gates and the area near the royal crest sometimes called the eagle area because of majestic statues

reviews New Jersey contributions of bubbles Westminster Abbey is also one of the most desirable burial sites in the UK Westminster Abbey is definitely one of the UK s most impressive churches It s here that key events in the life of the British Royal Family take place including Royal Weddings to date and Coronations the majority of British rulers since This medieval church graced by many royal weddings and coronations offers a magnificent peek at London s far reaching history We were here at AM that too on Monday but it was already crowded so not sure when to visit to beat the rush hour Westminster Abbey is also one of the most desirable burial sites in the UK with countless famous figures from British history buried here including Isaac Newton Charles Darwin Chaucer and multiple British royals prime ministers and more Even if you re not interested in the Royal family or the buried dead though you can t help but be impressed by this gorgeous gothic style building Westminster Abbey stands on a site that s been associated with Christianity since the early century Officially known as the Collegiate Church of St Peter in Westminster Westminster Abbey was founded by Edward the Confessor in as his place of interment This masterpiece of Gothic architecture not only has the highest Gothic nave in England feet it s also one of London s most popular tourist attractions drawing well over a million visitors each year Tip do a little research ahead of time to avoid missing your personal must sees For instance if you re a bibliophile consider a visit to the Poets Corner This is the final resting place of famed authors Geoffrey Chaucer Charles Dickens and Rudyard Kipling among others If you re fascinated by all the intrigue surrounding the British royalty you might like to visit the shared tomb of enemies and half sisters Elizabeth I Read more Review of Westminster Abbey Written April This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor
