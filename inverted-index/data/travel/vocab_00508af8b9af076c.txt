N Beltran Quan Kiu Aug min read Share Find your favorite Chicago neighborhood whether you re looking for highbrow art or low key drinks Page Light Studios Shutterstock With steely skyscrapers lakefront beaches and world class museums Chicago will blow you away with its low key yet highly cultured spirit The city center is an architectural wonder but itâ s Chicagoâ s mural splashed neighborhoods â full of inventive restaurants fringe theaters and sociable dive bars â that will create lasting memories of your time in the Windy City Here are the best neighborhoods to explore on your trip to Chicago The Loop is packed with interesting architecture and top tier sights Pamela Brick Shutterstock The Loop Best neighborhood for sightseeing Advertisement The Loop is the center of the action in Chicago named for the elevated train tracks that encircle its busy streets And though thereâ s debate on whether the Loop is an actual neighborhood no one can deny itâ s the beating heart of the city There s lots to see and do here the Art Institute Willis Tower the Theater District and Millennium Park are top draws while the city s biggest festivals keep people flocking to the area s large green spaces The Loop has loads of lodgings â cool boutique and architectural hotels are the specialty The neighborhood is convenient for the parks festival grounds museums and the Theater District with easy transport access to anywhere in the city Nightlife however is not the Loop s strong point Most of the restaurants and bars here are geared toward office workers so there s not much open after Streeterville and Navy Pier Best neighborhoods for shopping Streeterville packs in deep dish pizza parlors buzzy bistros art galleries and so many upscale stores that its main artery â Michigan Ave â has been dubbed the â Magnificent Mile â This neighborhood is unapologetically in your face commercial Shops restaurants and amusements abound Navy Pier a half mile long wharf of tour boats carnival rides and a flashy king sized Ferris wheel is the top sight Architecture is a neighborhood highlight thanks to iconic buildings such as the neo Gothic Tribune Tower and Marina City a vision of the future Art is another strong suit of the area especially underrated sights such as the Driehaus Museum and Arts Club of Chicago as well as Streeterville s many galleries The Near North is Chicago s most lodgings packed neighborhood with hotels on practically every street corner They re mostly midrange chain properties though a couple of nifty boutique hotels and hostel hotel hybrids are mixed in This neighborhood is also where you ll find Chicago s mother lode of restaurants There s a huge variety from deep dish pizza and ritzy seafood to modern Mexican Visitors are drawn here by all the hotels so prices can be higher than elsewhere Scenic Lincoln Park gave the surrounding neighborhood its name James Andrews Getty Images Lincoln Park and Old Town Best neighborhoods for comedy and live music The green space of Lincoln Park is Chicago s premier playground filled with lagoons walking paths beaches and zoo animals Meanwhile the nearby neighborhood of the same name adds top notch restaurants chic boutiques and lively blues and rock clubs to the mix To the south stylish Old Town hangs on to its free spirited bohemian past with artsy bars and the improv comedy bastion Second City Lodgings in this area range from hotels to B Bs and hostels and they have lots of character They re near fun nightlife and some are a short walk to Lincoln Park the zoo and beaches They re a bit removed from downtown s sights however It s also a popular neighborhood for short term apartment rentals High end restaurants such as Alinea and Boka hold court here but Lincoln Park caters to budget tastes too thanks to the student population of DePaul University Advertisement Old Town s options are quieter and quainter This is a great area to catch some top notch live performances in the evenings with numerous options ranging from blues and rock music to comedy improv and dramatic plays Gold Coast Best neighborhood for luxury The Gold Coast as you d expect from the name is Chicago s ritziest area Stylish locals glide in and out of the neighborhood s top end boutiques as the occasional Tesla or Rolls Royce wheels along the leafy streets The Gold Coast is relatively compact but it holds several worthwhile sights The Chicago observatory and Museum of Contemporary Art are the top attention grabbers Lodging options here tend to be large luxury hotels with easy access to downtown and the lakefront plus you have a shopping bonanza on your doorstep The Gold Coast is the epicenter of hot spot steakhouses swanky eateries and martini lounges for pretty people on the prowl You ll also find glamorous old time lounges and skyscraper bars with stellar views in this neighborhood Make a beeline to Chinatown for late night munchies Kit Leong Shutterstock Pilsen and Chinatown Best neighborhoods for culture Chinatown bustles with noodle shops and small storefronts and further west is Pilsen where Mexican culture mixes with Chicago s bohemian underground and colorful murals taquerias and cafes are the result Pilsen s St teems with Mexican taquerias tamale shops hip gastropubs and modern American restaurants Dive bar Caminos de Michoacan is a neighborhood staple and on the weekend it hosts Los Naturales a pop up natural wine bar before transforming into a late night hot spot Blue Island Ave is a similarly rich vein Chinatown offers a densely packed smorgasbord of noodle houses low cost bakeries and dim sum places Pilsen has activist cafes microbrewery taprooms and artsy dive bars while the Near South Side has neighborhood pubs and leafy patios Chinatown isn t much of a drinking destination though it rocks for satisfying late night post booze munchies South Loop Best neighborhood for museums The South Loop offers a wide range of things to do The Field Museum Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium cluster at the lakefront Museum Campus Peaceful Street Beach and hilly Northerly Island offer nearby refuges to ditch the crowds Historic house museums and a famed blues venue beckon nearby This neighborhood doesn t have many hotel options besides what s around the enormous convention center There s plenty of nightlife to check out in Lakeview after visiting Wrigley Field Wirestock Creators Shutterstock Lakeview and Wrigleyville Best neighborhoods for nightlife Lakeview is the overarching name of this good time neighborhood known for its nonstop lineup of bars theaters rock halls and global eateries Wrigleyville is the pocket that surrounds star attraction Wrigley Field where big changes are afoot For years sticky floored boozers were the stock in trade Now cocktail bars fancy donut shops and trendy restaurants have joined the game â foodies and families are thrilled Those who perceive a loss of local color are not Nightlife is the specialty of Lakeview and Wrigleyville and there are heaps of options traditional sports bars and new cocktail bars around Wrigley Field dance clubs and gay bars in Boystown and cozy wine bars English pubs and jazz wafting taverns scattered elsewhere throughout the neighborhood Some great new boutique hotels have popped up recently especially near Wrigley Field They join several existing boutique properties and B Bs most of which are surrounded by rollicking bars restaurants and music venues The main areas can be congested and rowdy at night Room prices typically rise when the Cubs are playing

and Ukrainian Village Best neighborhoods for restaurants The three neighborhoods of Wicker Park Bucktown and Ukrainian Village in the larger area of West Town are hot properties Independent record
