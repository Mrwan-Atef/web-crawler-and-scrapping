Share The capital of Costa Rica can be confusing and difficult to navigate but it s always an adventure Â Salvador Aznar Getty Images To put it politely getting around San JosÃ is always an adventure The capital of Costa Rica started as several different towns which gradually merged together over a landscape of rolling hills The city has experienced rapid growth in recent decades along with bold experiments in â urban renewal â The resulting street patterns can be confusing claustrophobic and extremely hard to navigate especially for first timers Advertisement But take heart more than residents move around this city every day most of them on foot or by bus and once you get a feel for the place the major sights are pretty accessible Taxis are easy to find and can take you anywhere and transport options only get more budget friendly from there Expect some trial and error but with a little patience you can get there from here Sometimes it s fastest to hoof from one San JosÃ landmark to another Â Guayo Fuentes Shutterstock Conquer the crowds on foot Despite appearances San JosÃ is relatively walkable The â cityâ is usually measured between the neighborhoods of La Sabana and San Pedro and you could casually stroll these in less than two hours Everything in the middle is reachable on foot â and in some cases hoofing from one landmark to another is faster than any other means The complex layout and endless one way streets are far less stressful when you can just stop and turn around Like many urban centers San JosÃ is packed with hawkers and panhandlers and in crowded areas like Avenida Central you wonâ t walk more than a block without some solicitation Watch the side streets for cross traffic as speeding cars often appear from nowhere Evenings can be particularly foreboding in San JosÃ and itâ s wise to walk in pairs or groups as you explore the robust local nightlife We also recommend sensible shoes Litter is a major problem downtown as are uneven sidewalks and deep potholes This may be the tropics but for a long promenade youâ ll be grateful you kept those hiking boots on San JosÃ city buses are cheap dependable and easy to ride Â Salvador Aznar Getty Images Master the bus system like a local City buses are cheap dependable and easy to ride Better yet San JosÃ is the epicenter of bus traffic not only for the Central Valley but for the entire country Youâ ll rarely have to pay more than colones about US to get anywhere in the city and its environs and the vast majority of urban Ticos commute by mass transit so youâ re in good company Bus drivers keep a bundle of cash and a boxful of coins so paying your fare is an easy way to break medium sized bills Advertisement Most passengers are well behaved on the bus as well You might hear a song being played too loud from a smartphone but most rides are blissfully quiet The one drawback is the complexity of the system stops and routes are scattered throughout the city and itâ s often hard to tell where to board and when the bus will arrive Virtual maps can be helpful but itâ s smart to double check with locals Legions of taxis rojos ride through the San JosÃ streets Â Salvador Aznar Getty Images Get anywhere in a red taxi The go to cab service in San JosÃ is the taxi rojo red taxi and sure enough each car is painted fire engine red Legions of taxis ride through the streets and park in queues and theyâ re easy to flag down Most taxistas are honest but when you enter the car make sure that the marÃ a meter is visible and working The taxis rojos have received a lot of competition from Uber to the chagrin of local drivers Both are dependable options and a great alternative to long walks through downtown throngs Insider tip Some cars are painted red but theyâ re not official taxis Other drivers skip the facade and just use their regular cars offering rides for cash These cabs are known as piratas pirates and although many are nice guys trying to make a quick buck we donâ t recommend using one if you can avoid it Drive if you dare All across Costa Rica a rugged will take you to secret corners you never imagined and youâ ll be so grateful you rented some wheels except in San JosÃ Visitors should avoid driving in the city until itâ s absolutely necessary Driving in the capital is confusing nerve wracking and often dangerous Streets are narrow people and pets routinely wander into the road and near invisible speed bumps affectionately known as muertos or â dead bodiesâ can wreck your axle In highway gridlock assume that motorcyclists will whiz between the ranks of idling cars On the bright side Ticos donâ t usually drive very fast Most motorists are assertive and pushy but youâ ll rarely encounter road rage even in the worst traffic There are many places to rent a car downtown which is convenient for escaping the sprawl but if youâ re just hopping around local neighborhoods a taxi is far more pleasant Insider tip Parking takes many forms in San JosÃ The sign to watch out for is parqueo parking lot or garage If your hotel doesnâ t have dedicated parking these secure lots are the safest place to stow your ride Street parking can be a head scratcher especially in neighborhoods like Barrio Escalante where certain spaces are best reserved with an app On most streets youâ ll find a man passively watching the cars Heâ s usually older and may wear an orange vest This person is a guachimÃ n watchman and you can usually pay him the equivalent of a dollar to help you parallel park and make sure nobody messes with your vehicle With rare exceptions this is a well established system and worth the pocket change Ride the rails with commuters The San JosÃ train system is one of the cityâ s best kept secrets and few tourists ever think to ride it The central hub is the AtlÃ ntico a historic little building on the edge of Barrio Escalante You can buy a ticket at the window and the train will slice through stand still traffic like a machete through a ripe mango Most trains only run in the mornings and afternoons but the lines will take you to such far off suburbs as Alajuela Heredia Curridabat and Cartago Accessible Travel in San JosÃ Costa Rica Costa Rica has made great leaps in accessibility in recent years and San JosÃ s more popular destinations â such as the Teatro Nacional â often have ramps for wheelchairs and staff sensitive to disabilities Newer hotels are equipped with elevators and taxis can be a convenient way to get around That said the capital has a long way to go sidewalks are narrow and curb cuts are scattered Accessible restrooms can be very hard to come by and public buses arenâ t generally equipped with wheelchair lifts Ironically San JosÃ can be much more challenging than the national parks such as the â universally accessibleâ Parque Nacional Cara For more information see Lonely Planetâ s Accessible Travel Resources page Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with
