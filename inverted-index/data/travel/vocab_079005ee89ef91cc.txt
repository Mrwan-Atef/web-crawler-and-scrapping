Photograph by Tsumkwe Country Lodge TRAVEL What it s like to go on a bushwalk in the Kalahari Desert A bushwalk with Ju Hoansi San guides adds a fascinating dimension to a safari in Namibia s northern wilderness By Emma Gregg August This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK On an African safari it s good to adjust your viewpoint from time to time As your impressions shift the experience deepens Wildlife watching from the deck of a lodge or the back of a safari vehicle can be exciting and inspiring but that s nothing compared to the thrill of taking the front seat or even better exploring a nature reserve on foot At ground level sounds and smells seem amplified the crunch of sand or twigs underfoot the tang of hot dust the sweet whiff of wild herbs in the air Ready to summon a rush of raw emotions Try doing what I m doing hunkering down in the tawny grass for a lion s eye view of things It s highly unlikely that we ll be surprised by a big cat here in northeast Namibia s Nyae Nyae Conservancy counting both guides and guests there are well over a dozen people on my morning bushwalk and there s safety in numbers But there are definitely predators in this stretch of the Kalahari Desert somewhere and there s every chance that we ll spot their tracks We ve sunk down on our haunches for an impromptu lesson in fire starting Our guides are a party of Ju Hoansi San the denotes one of the different click sounds in their dialect Dressed for the occasion in traditional antelope skins and beads they re showing me some of the old ways Prompted by a dignified elder Kaece and his wife Oro the lesson unfolds It starts swiftly and simply with friction Speed and steadiness is important and strong hands says Kaece via Tsamkgao I ae my Ju Hoan interpreter Also known as gemsbok the South African oryx are most commonly found in Namibia s Kalahari Desert Photograph by Henrik Karlsson Getty Images Using rapid palm movements to rotate a vertical stick in a notch in a second stick that s laid horizontally Kaece generates enough heat to create curls of smoke in a bird s nest like bundle of dry grass beneath Cupping the grass he blows softly jerking his head away with a grin when the first flames leap out If you think that looks easy give it a try says Tsamkgao I quickly discover it s not easy at all With hands smarting from the effort I rise to my feet feeling slightly giddy A shimmer of heat haze blurs the horizon We press on Kaece and his extended family leading me along sandy paths trodden by many generations of antelopes Pausing every so often at a low tree or shrub they show me which leaves can be chewed or crushed and used as a stomach medicine antiseptic or stimulant Next they demonstrate which tubers when hacked open deliver precious drops of water a crucial resource in this endless seeming swathe of arid scrubland devoid of rivers or waterholes In the Ju Hoansi s gentle company this sun baked landscape seems bountiful and positively hospitable but I m fully aware that if they left me here alone I wouldn t stand a chance Southern Africa s San who sometimes call themselves Bushmen have always considered themselves the oldest people on Earth Genetic research suggests that for most of the past years they were the world s largest ethnic group In recent centuries however they have dwindled to around a hundred thousand with the Ju Hoansi a minority within this population it s thought that just a few thousand Ju Hoan speakers remain In the early century the Ju Hoansi were still living a nomadic life hunting and gathering in the wildlife rich region that later became Etosha National Park Etosha was recognised as an official reserve in and within years the pre independence apartheid government had driven the nomads out of their traditional hunting grounds or n ore the Ju hoansi word for the place to which you belong Banned from Etosha they were pushed east into an isolated arid and hostile block of the Kalahari that the government called Bushmanland adjoining the border with Botswana Most settled in or around the ragged village of Tjum kui or Tsumkwe around miles from Etosha Forced to abandon their hunter gatherer lifestyle the Ju Hoansi struggled to adjust Their culture of equality and tolerance was not suited to a system in which the best way to get their voices heard was to appoint leaders and committees and they have been marginalised ever since Ecotourism projects like my bushwalk offer glimmers of hope however Run by the Ju Hoansi on their own terms they generate funds for the communities while protecting nature and keeping ancestral skills alive The Ju Hoansi s understanding of native botany has created other opportunities too a root called devil s claw for example is in international demand as an anti inflammatory treatment for rheumatism and arthritis Whether it s for tourists or for medicine it s our knowledge of plants in the bush that pays for modern essentials like transport and schooling says Tsamkgao If things were different and we didn t need money we could survive by foraging and hunting for just a couple of hours a day leaving more time for socialising or making art It s hard to imagine a healthier lifestyle How to do it Lufthansa flies from Heathrow to Windhoek in Namibia via Frankfurt or fly from Gatwick via Addis Ababa with
