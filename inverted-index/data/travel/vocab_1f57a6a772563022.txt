choice in Estremadura Ribatejo Login Save It s difficult to believe that a century ago this was rocky pastureland outside an insignificant village This vast complex is now one of Catholicism s major shrines the focus of enormous devotion and pilgrimage At the eastern end is the Basílica de Nossa Senhora do Rosário de Fátima a triumphantly sheer white building with colonnade reminiscent of St Peter s Nearby the Capela das Aparições Chapel of the Apparitions marks the site where the Virgin appeared five times in At the precinct s western end is the Basílica da Santíssima Trindade In between is a massive space where the crowds gather The Capela das Aparições is the focus of the most intense devotion Supplicants who have promised penance for example in return for helping a loved one who is sick or to signify a particularly deep conversion shuffle on their knees across the vast esplanade following a long marble runway polished smooth by previous penitents Near the chapel is a blazing

queue wait times can top half a day on the holiest of days The sound of hundreds of candles is like a rushing waterfall Inside the older church the Basílica de Nossa Senhora do Rosário de Fátima
