Martinez Jul min read Share Berlin is famous for its party spirit and liberal view on life Â Elen Marlen Getty Images Berlin has risen from the ashes of its troubled century past and grown into one of the most liberal and safe cities in the world Looking at Berlin today it s hard to imagine that the city was divided by barricades for nearly three decades during the Cold War After living for several years in the German capital I ve learned the unspoken language of the city how to behave in certain circumstances how to avoid uncomfortable situations and the doâ s and donâ ts when the sun goes down Berlin is full of magic positive energy and excitement â but there are places where a little caution is wise Here are the top things you need to know before a visit to Berlin Travel at off peak times Berlin is Germany s top tourist destination and there s a lot of competition for hotel rooms and transport at peak times The city is always busy during the summer season from June to September visiting either side of this period means cooler weather but smaller crowds and slightly lower prices Advertisement Things also get very busy during Oktoberfest and at Christmas â unless you re sold on crowds and long waits for drinks you ll have an easier cheaper trip at other times of the year It s wise to make reservations ahead to visit the Reichstag with its famous dome Â Nikada Getty Images Book tickets in advance It s a good idea to book tickets or make reservations ahead of time for major sights particularly if you want to tour the Reichstag You can try your luck for a space after you arrive by dropping by the Reichstag Visitors Centre on Scheidemannstrasse but it s very popular The book ahead rule also applies to reservations at prestigious restaurants such as Coda Rutz HorvÃ th or Kin Dee Save money on transport Traveling from the gleaming new Berlin Brandenburg Airport to the center by taxi is expensive Instead take either the FEX Airport Express train Deutsche Bahn train or or the slower S Bahn train to Hauptbahnhof station in central Berlin the train station is in Terminal If you plan to use public transport in Berlin it s worth downloading the BVG Tickets app for Berlin s public transport company Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe before you come You can use it to buy a Stunden Karte day pass which covers all forms of public transport for hours The Berlin Welcome tourist card covers public transport and discounted entry to sights buy it online to save even more euros The best day trips from Berlin history nature and plenty of fun In Berlin you can wear what you want Â Maskot Getty Images Dress codes depend on the district Unlike the rest of Germany where smart casual dress dominates Berlin is a city with no rules when it comes to fashion Whether you wear a tight leather suit or a floral crown you ll be welcomed with open arms Trends change depending on which district you visit In Charlottenburg and Mitte people tend to wear fancier and more elegant clothing while in laid back Kreuzberg or NeukÃ lln youâ ll rarely find anyone showing off the latest catwalk collection Advertisement Techno culture has significantly influenced the dress code in Berlin Dark clothes with rips or holes leather and combat boots are the standard when wandering around Berlinâ s coolest districts However travelers trying to imitate this style to enter Berlinâ s most famous techno clubs may end up being rejected Berlin accepts everything and everyone but when it comes to fashion what counts is being authentic I once went to a renowned techno club in Berlin wearing just my sleeping attire â be yourself and you ll usually get a warm welcome Manners matter in Berlin Berliners are a relaxed bunch but manners are important Etiquette when meeting new people is to shake hands and say guten morgen before noon guten Tag between noon and or guten Abend after Germans use the same word â Entschuldigung â to say â excuse meâ to attract attention and â sorryâ to apologize If drinking wine the proper toast is Z um Wohl â with beer it s P rost There are many reminders of Berlin s troubled past but be sensitive about mentioning it in conversation Â by Martin Deja Getty Images Talking about Germanyâ s past Germans are still very ashamed of the country s century history itâ s a sensitive topic and locals tend to avoid talking about it This said while older generations are tired of having to explain themselves and answer uncomfortable questions younger Berliners are more willing to confront the events that occurred during this dark time and help travelers to understand it better Nevertheless this is a topic that you should broach carefully Jokes about Hitler or the Nazis are intolerable â Berliners understand the curiosity of most travelers and are often willing to carefully talk about the past but treat the topic with respect and try not to offend anyone by accident Nazi symbols are banned by authorities nationwide and displaying flags or using a certain kind of rhetoric or specific Nazi gestures can lead to heavy fines and even imprisonment Avoiding pickpockets in Berlin As in any major city pickpocketing is a common problem in Berlin Beware of stealthy thieves in busy touristy areas Places like Alexanderplatz Zoo Garten and Mitte are frequented by opportunists looking for an easy target and the Berliner S Bahn and U Bahn are notorious for pickpockets during rush hour Reduce the risks by keeping your valuables in your backpack and holding it in front of you on transport Keep a tight grip on your bags in large crowds â especially on the U Bahn and S Bahn Avoid falling asleep while taking public transport dozing travelers are a favorite target for pickpockets stealing wallets and phones at night German police are generally helpful and friendly to tourists Most officers speak English and should be your first port of call if you are lost robbed or encounter any uncomfortable situation Tips for safe protesting in Berlin Protesting is considered one of the most important rights in Germany and usually a positive atmosphere pervades Berlin is filled with young well educated and liberal people so thereâ s usually some kind of protest every week demanding action on issues as diverse as climate change human rights and European politics While most protests are peaceful and friendly they can be crowded and intense and in some cases marches can turn violent Scuffles have been a common feature of Labor Day May protests since the and the marches have become a symbol of Berlinâ s rebellious identity Attending is not for the faint hearted What starts out as a friendly party in the districts of Prenzlauer Berg Friedrichshain or Kreuzberg can turn violent if clashes break out between radical groups and the police The risk of rioting has decreased significantly since the but travelers looking for a trouble free trip may want to stay away from the protests Berlin nightlife is fun filled and uninhibited but you should always practice caution when out at night Â N T Getty Images Use of illegal substances According to millions of party people Berlinâ s nightlife is the best in the world From iconic techno clubs such as Berghain Tresor and Watergate to smaller and more intimate venues outside the Ringbahn nightlife in the German capital goes all night long â and it s often assisted by the use of illegal substances Dealers loitering next to Warschauer Strasse Kottbuser Tor and GÃ rlitzer Park offer all kinds of substances out in the open While we wouldn t presume to tell you how to live your life itâ s risky to buy illegal drugs on the street when visiting a foreign country Many of the drugs sold on the streets to tourists are altered or laced with dangerous ingredients If you donâ t know what youâ re taking it can lead to dangerous complications You ll have fewer hassles all around if you steer clear of drugs and stick instead to Germany s excellent beers Top free things to do in Berlin Night time safety in Berlin Even though some areas of Berlin are rather poorly maintained the city is generally a safe place at night Walking back home after a couple of drinks is very normal for locals and tourists and hassles are rare While most travelers wonâ t encounter any problems during their stay in the German capital itâ s sensible to be a bit more cautious after dark as in any large city Avoid walking around flashing expensive items and gadgets and be aware of your surroundings Be ready to change paths if you see a group of aggressive drunk people loitering on the street and avoid quiet side streets and parks after dark If you re traveling solo itâ s best to err on the side of caution and take a taxi or an Uber rather than walking back to your hotel Berlin scams to be aware of One scam that surfaces from time to time in Berlin is fake police officers who stop tourists under the pretense of searching for drugs or counterfeit money â part of a ruse to steal valuables Demand to see ID cards from police officers Also avoid buying â usedâ public transport tickets from people outside stations â they re often forged or expired Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
