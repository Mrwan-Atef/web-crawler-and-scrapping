How Swiss yodeling is changing for the modern era A young boy holds an alphorn at the fourth Swiss yodeling festival in Interlaken Berne in Synonymous with Alpine culture yodeling was how mountain herders called their stock Some say modernizing it could revitalize the singing style Photograph by STR Keystone Redux TRAVEL Switzerland s yodeling tradition is changing Here s how to experience it The Swiss tradition has found its way into rebellious Eurovision pop songs and feminist choirs By Malcolm Jack August min read Yodeling has been practiced probably for as long as humans have expressed themselves through song But the singing style synonymous with Switzerland and its Alpine neighbors hasn t always been a crowd pleaser In A Tramp Abroad Mark Twain wrote During the remainder of the day we hired the rest of the jodlers not to jodl anymore Fellow century traveling man of letters Sir Walter Scott was even more scathing when in an journal entry he likened the sounds to the tones of a jackass Despite yodeling s historical detractors Roman Emperor Julian wasn t a fan either ancient forms can be found all around the world from Scandinavian kulning to Iranian tahrir and Hawaiian leo ki eki e In Switzerland today there are around official federal yodeling society members plus a triennial festival that draws up to fans to enjoy competition in not just yodeling but also alphorn blowing and flag waving It s so ingrained in the culture that the government is seeking UNESCO cultural heritage status for it Yet as ubiquitous as it is yodeling can t seem to shake its bad rap Even in Switzerland some say the mostly male practice represents a bastion of traditionalism that needs to change with the times Is yodeling so hard to love or is it just misunderstood Is it destined for dusty music libraries or will a new generation bring it into the modern age Yodeling history and misunderstandings In pastoral times the loud rapidly trilling vocalization was a way for Swiss mountain herders to call their livestock or communicate between villages In the century it was a form of European music hall entertainment that traveled the globe becoming popular particularly in the United States Nowadays there are essentially two forms of Swiss yodeling The naturjodel is a wordless melody said to express the feelings of the mountain people in distinct regional dialects The jodellied or yodel song is a more modern style influenced by century vocal aesthetics Typically it comprises a few stanzas of text about rustic romantic things like mountains and flowers followed by a trilling syllabic refrain Deviation from these norms is generally frowned upon within the Swiss yodeling establishment as embodied by the Eidgenössischer Jodlerverband EJV the federal yodeling association Members of the Schuppel yodel group perform during the Silvesterchlausen celebration in Appenzell on January The annual tradition involves men dressed in colorful costumes yodeling at area farms to greet the new year Photograph by Michael Buholzer AFP Getty Images Dutch American music writer Bart Plantenga is perhaps the world s leading authority on yodeling He has dedicated a large part of his life to seeking it out including in Switzerland which he hails as a spiritual center for yodeling Plantenga stresses the importance of not letting preconceptions cloud people s understanding of the art form A cultural prejudice has accumulated from clichés about what yodeling is he says No it s not just Switzerland and a couple of cowboys In Plantenga s view scarcely a single style of music has been able to resist the intoxicating call of the yodel in one way or another It s far more pervasive than people would probably realize he says demographically geographically and genre wise South Korea s K pop cultural wave is on an unstoppable global rise His writings trace yodeling s roots and evolution from the Solomon Islands to Bollywood from the Alps to Australia and Japan Musicians as diverse as Gustav Mahler Hank Williams Jr and Bob Dylan have been somehow influenced by yodeling You can hear it today in Eurovision pop songs just as you can in free jazz Plantenga points to rebel Swiss folk singer Christine Lauterburg as one example of a progressive approach to yodeling Lauterburg s fusion of yodeling and techno has been both critically acclaimed and decried In this photo yodelers demonstrate their vocal prowess at the Suisse Romande yodeling festival in Neuchatel Switzerland Photograph by STR Keystone Redux Traditional yodeling however is much less visible outside of festivals and concerts There are some small regions in Switzerland where you can find people sitting in a restaurant and suddenly somebody starts to sing and everybody joins the singing says Nadja Räss a renowned Swiss yodeler who has taught since at Lucerne University the world s first academic degree in the song style I think years ago that was more normal Nowadays if you sing in a restaurant spontaneously then the people look at you like oh is she drunk Räss emphasizes the importance of the social and communal aspect of yodeling re normalizing it in public spaces for instance She seeks to help students understand the tradition in its wider global context Yodeling is like a language you can understand everywhere in the world she says Can songs save an endangered language How yodeling is changing So central do the Swiss consider the singing style to their cultural identity that the government is submitting it to UNESCO s Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list By as soon as yodeling may be enshrined alongside the French baguette and the Congolese rumba as a protected tradition But how exactly do you etch in stone the definition of a folk art that has evolved so much and continues to change It s a question that speaks to an ongoing tug of war within the Swiss yodeling community between those such as the EJV and others who believe in loosening the dirndl to allow individual creativity to flourish The idea of controlling what is your own folk music is utterly ridiculous argues Plantenga Here s how to explore Morocco through its soulful music traditions A group of Swiss alphorn blowers arrive at the yodel festival in Davos Switzerland on July The triannual festival draws hundreds of thousands of yodel fans from around the world Photograph by Arno Balzarini Keystone AP Photo Räss sees no shortage of passion and promise among yodelers from all ages and backgrounds But she senses a desire among many to break free of existing structures and customs As an example she highlights Echo vom Eierstock or echo from the ovary a feminist choir on a mission to update outmoded male centric yodel lyrics to reflect modern experiences especially among women For me yodeling nowadays is very colorful Räss reflects It s very important to have all these different styles beside each other For year old Michèle Obrist who belongs to the Echo Baarburg yodeling club in Zug yodeling is a family tradition Yet she believes that the idea that yodeling is only associated with men is a stereotype Traditions naturally face the challenge of dwindling participation as they tend to be more prevalent among older generations she says It s understandable why a year old wouldn t want to join a group where everyone is over years old However there are numerous projects in the yodeling community that bring together many young people she continues And this is both important and encouraging What to know Here s how to experience yodeling in Switzerland Swiss Federal Yodeling
