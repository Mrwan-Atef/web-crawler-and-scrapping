Could Heart of Wales railway line be the country s best kept secret TRAVEL Find echoes of the past on this eccentric railway through Wales s rural heart Take a slow train journey from Craven Arms in England to Llanelli in Wales passing bucolic farmland sleepy villages and centuries old castles The Heart of Wales Line train crosses the Cynghordy Viaduct through vast Welsh farmland just past lunchtime Photograph by Dominic Vacher By Oliver Smith February This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK One spring day in Dr Richard Beeching published a document on behalf of the British Transport Commission entitled The Reshaping of British Railways Squirrelled at the back was Appendix II Passenger Service Line and Station Closures Visit any of those railways in that appendix today and you ll invariably find the same thing buddleia growing tall on old track beds Victorian stations repurposed as holiday lets quiet places that haven t known the toot of a passing train for decades The so called Beeching Axe is infamous for making a certain kind of railway line near extinct slow wildly unprofitable rural branches the sort you might find lovingly depicted on tea towels and piece jigsaws But in Beeching s appendix was one notable victim on which the axe didn t land the railway between Craven Arms and Llanelli granted reprieve by the Ministry of Transport It survives as the Heart of Wales line Ride this remote artery and the views from your window seat are much as they ever were of heathery mountains cascading rivers and castles that glower darkly over the rails The Class that arrives in Craven Arms as I stand on the platform one morning is a single carriage service barely longer than a country bus On board its engine rattles agriculturally and air conditioning entails a tug of war with a stiff window It s not a heritage line preserved in aspic but a part of Britain s railway network that people use to get to work Still in our midst are aficionados The passenger opposite me reaches for a corkscrew and a bottle of supermarket red and settles in for the performance The train begins by cantering over Shropshire farmland beating out a lively jig Eventually we reach Knighton the station is in England but its car park is in Wales Beyond the border the landscape changes Norman churches give way to Methodist chapels cricket greens to rugby clubs Gradually the Bronze Age moorlands of Elenydd rise above the lower slopes dotted with tufts of white There are reputedly million sheep in Wales and on the Heart of Wales line you become acquainted with most of them Sometimes they wander onto the track and are chased off by the driver The Heart of Wales line stands on its own in many ways says Owen Griffkin of the Heart of Wales Line Community Partnership who I speak to over the phone Some people who use the line actively want to travel slowly They ll spend nine hours riding it back and forth in a day and bring a picnic with them Losing track of time It s gone lunchtime when we cross the grand Victorian spans of the Knucklas and Cynghordy Viaducts the former guarded by crenelated towers as though our train were crossing a castle drawbridge Beyond Sugar Loaf station we emerge from a tunnel to soar high above the conifers in the company of buzzards Another part of the line s appeal is occasionally disembarking exploring little market towns of lace curtains antiques shops old drovers inns and of course castles I stop to spend a night at the New White Lion Llandovery a handsome little hotel with rooms themed after local folk heroes It s a five minute stroll to the erstwhile castle of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd Fychan a medieval nobleman who led English forces pursuing Owain Glyndwr on a wild goose chase and was disemboweled for his treachery He s commemorated with a silver statue overlooking the rooftops of the town The next day I hop back on the eastbound train to the border In the gathering dusk we roll through an archipelago of spa towns and villages Llanwrtyd Wells Llangammarch Wells Llandrindod Wells to which Victorian holidaymakers once came to ease ailments rest and recuperate Those historic spas are now gone the therapeutic waters untapped But in a way riding this eccentric train provides its own source of wellbeing You are massaged by the undulations of the rustic rails calmed by their clanking rhythms The timetables on this line are thin delays are common Once on board however you generally find you lose track of time entirely Seat from Trip supported by Belmond Published in the
