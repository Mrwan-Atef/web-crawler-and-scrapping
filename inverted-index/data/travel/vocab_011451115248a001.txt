thousands of rhinestones magazine scraps and glitter enough to make it seem as if you ve wandered into a magical realm To see this lavishly embellished cottage the vision and craft of Loy Bowlin a self proclaimed original rhinestone cowboy don t drive to McComb Mississippi where it was created Instead head to Sheboygan Wisconsin and visit the Art Preserve a massive new museum devoted to large

reassembled in the three level showplace which opened June as an annex to the nearby John Michael Kohler Arts Center a museum devoted to visionary art You can create art out of almost anything says Sam Gappmayer director of the Kohler Arts Center which is located three miles away Visionary artists are masters of remixing often repurposing discarded materials scrap metal plywood cement or trash into unconventional new works including murals to the Virgin Mary cloistered in cabins or phantasmagorical gardens filled with whirligigs To Gappmayer visionary art is basic human expression but with groundbreaking potential and thrilling capacity Why these fantastical dreamscapes life sized sculptures and unorthodox religious grottos have flourished in Wisconsin is a story as compelling as the works themselves Lumberjack turned sculptor Fred Smith s decked out concrete statues are among the works by visionary artists now on view at the Art Preserve Photograph by Kevin Miyazaki The New York

most accepted term today is visionary art Folk art is rooted in tradition says Leslie Umberger curator of folk and self taught art at Washington D C s Smithsonian American Art Museum Driven by their own reasons and world views visionary artists follow an inner North star to re envision and reshape a small piece of the planet Visionaries like other artists are motivated by many things faith loss their own idiosyncratic beliefs You have the necessity to build something for yourself to protect yourself from the outside says Valérie Rousseau a curator at New York City s American Folk Art Museum It s saying to the world Hey I m not like everybody There s nothing like encountering such visionary works in the spots where they were created In the U S such unschooled art has often flourished in rural agrarian places Art environments in the Midwest took inspiration from Northern European immigrant culture and the visual style of religious grottos says Umberger These makers often had ample land personal agency and bountiful lives that allowed for pursuits beyond the workday See how this Danish artist turns trash in trolls The growing popularity of the automobile in the and bolstered the concept of roadside attractions This helped inspire ordinary people to assemble extraordinary things in the hope someone might pay a few dollars to enter or just stop in to buy a postcard The

Dickeyville Grotto in the early century Rocks colored glass seashells and bits of costume jewelry cover the buildings and fences images of Jesus the Virgin Mary and Abraham Lincoln channel Wernerus dual passions for religion and patriotism In the central part of the state the Rudolph Grotto Gardens erected by another early century priest fills five acres with rustic rock framed statues of saints and angels as well as a manmade Wonder Cave modeled on Rome s catacombs Other visionaries wrote their own narratives At Dr Evermor s Sculpture Park near Baraboo Wisconsin scrap metal birds and robot

organization toward visionary art after meeting Fred Smith and wandering among his concrete figures in the late Kohler died in shortly before the new museum was complete Learn how these industrial sites are finding new life in the Midwest A painter like Rembrandt was making individual canvases and didn t necessarily see them as a whole she told the New York Times in These artists really do Their vision is bigger than a single piece Works by a diverse cadre of artists find new homes here They include century Nebraska sculptor Emery Blagdon s The Healing Machine a room sized tableau of sparkling wire mobiles and wooden boxes he believed could stimulate electricity And works by Wisconsin s Levi Fisher Ames who was sidelined as a carpenter by a Civil War battle injury but went on to craft a series of stacking hand carved wooden shadow boxes holding animals both real giraffes elephants and imagined a toothy Ring Tailed Doodle These wild and wondrous works evoke a sense of amazement and offer a chance to imagine what it might be like to ride a pile of rusty metal to the heavens or to dwell in a rhinestone walled house Artists create large scale environments intending them to be a whole experience not one off pieces says Gappmayer Seeing them can expand your own capacities to be creative Kristine Hansen is a Wisconsin based writer who specializes in art and food
