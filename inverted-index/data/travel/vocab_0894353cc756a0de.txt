and mobile networks Rosie Bell Jan min read Share Here s how to keep your cell phone connected when traveling in Mexico Marco Bottigelli Getty Images With pyramids crystal clear cenotes bioluminescent lagoons world famous museums and blinding blue beaches Mexico â s best experiences are worth writing home about Sending those â wish you were hereâ messages is easier than ever if you stay plugged in whether through wi fi a local SIM or an eSIM A WhatsApp message to your Airbnb host hailing a ride to an offbeat cantina or calling for help when your rental car breaks down â itâ s all easier when youâ re continuously connected As you travel through the states there will be a dozen things youâ ll want to Google like the difference between a tasty torta sandwich and a gordita filled corn tortilla pocket the best beach entry points in Tulum or how to navigate any of the maze like mercados markets Youâ ll be glad to have your smartphone as a lifeline to buy ADO bus tickets online upon arrival at Cancun International Airport CUN to bypass the sometimes long lines there or to check your banking app before withdrawing cash from the ATM Hereâ s everything you need to know about getting your cell phone connected in Mexico If you re just visiting Mexico for a weekend you might be happy to accept the roaming charges from your home provider Richie Chan Shutterstock Will my phone work in Mexico Most phones will work in Mexico but not all plans are created equal If youâ re visiting from the US or Canada chances are your mobile provider offers international roaming options but beware of the fine print Advertisement Roaming charges can pile up quickly which might be fine for a quick trip but if youâ re in Mexico for more than a weekend or plan to use data heavily browsing Spotify checking directions streaming a few episodes of something etc youâ re better off getting a local SIM or an eSIM That way you donâ t have to keep an eye on your data like a hawk and you can put any savings towards tantalizing street food tours or anything else your heart desires on the ground Make sure that your phone is not locked to your home carrier If your phone is unlocked youâ re golden Grab a local SIM called a â chipâ in Mexico or order an eSIM and think about your data needs before committing to a plan A safe bet for most travelers is per day Mexicoâ s mobile coverage is solid with widespread in cities and towns and available at the highly touristed areas like Cabo San Lucas Signal bars fade in rural pueblos villages mountainous regions and deep in the jungle What mobile networks are available in Mexico Mexicoâ s big three are Telcel AT T MÃ xico and Movistar Telcel is the main provider here dominating both the market and the more far flung regions Itâ s your best bet for good coverage if youâ re heading off the beaten path including small towns like Sayulita or remote yet covetable beaches in Baja California AT T MÃ xico and Movistar hold their own in urban hubs like Mexico City Guadalajara and MÃ rida but can falter once you hit remote areas and the countryside Stick with Telcel if youâ d rather not be stuck in the abyss somewhere with no signal and no Spanish skills No matter where you are in Mexico there are stores selling local SIM cards Ronnie Chua Shutterstock How can I get a local SIM card The good news is that unlike some other countries in Mexico you do not require a passport or ID to get a SIM card Just make sure your phone is unlocked pop in the SIM top it up and youâ re ready to roll All three providers have dedicated shops at airports malls and city centers where you can purchase a â chipâ and a data plan One of the most convenient places to get a SIM card in Mexico is at the OXXO stores that are ubiquitous across the country with more than branches everywhere from cities to small towns They stock Telcel OXXO Cel a Telcel subsidiary AT T and Movistar SIM cards Supermarkets like Walmart Soriana and Chedraui also sell SIM cards and offer recharge services Though convenient buying your SIM card at airport kiosks can mean inflated prices This is certainly true in CancÃºn Itâ s better to wait until you reach the city to buy one Advertisement Again remember that your phone needs to be unlocked to use a Mexican SIM so check before you arrive Take note of your new number printed on the SIM card packaging Youâ ll need it for calls with your new amigos and for topping up later Is eSIM available in Mexico and how does it work If you hate fumbling with SIM cards eSIMs are your salvation Providers like Saily Holafly and Airalo let you activate a plan online with no physical card required and you can start browsing in minutes â no muss no fuss Mexico eSIMs let you keep your primary number active while using a local network for data making it easier to stay in touch with folks back home We recommend Saily as our eSIM partner for your next trip to Mexico Use code to receive a discount on your Saily mobile data plan If youâ re a heavy data user consider one of the premium or packages Most newer smartphones including the latest iPhones and Android devices are eSIM compatible Be sure to check your phoneâ s settings before purchasing Free wi fi is usually available at cafes and restaurants although you may not get the password until after you ve bought something Hero Images Getty Images Where can I find reliable wi fi in Mexico Wi fi is largely available for free in urban areas and the main plazas of cities like San Miguel de Allende and Playa del Carmen Mexico City reportedly has over free wi fi hotspots Cafes hotel lobbies and restaurants often provide complementary wi fi Sometimes the passwords are plastered on a wall or sign for everyone to see other times youâ ll need to order something to unlock the network details printed discreetly on your receipt Bus terminals usually have public networks but the connection can be spotty especially during peak hours Most major airports also offer free wi fi though speeds can be hit or miss and sessions time limited Many long distance and inter city buses like ADO actually provide free wi fi To play it safe download maps playlists and entertainment before long bus rides just in case Cybersecurity is worth keeping in mind Avoid logging into sensitive accounts such as banking apps on public wi fi to reduce the risk of data theft How fast and reliable is the internet Speedtest ranks Mexico globally for mobile speeds but signal performance depends on where you are For example digital nomads may find themselves battling sluggish connections in surf spots like Mazunte and Puerto Escondido When your lodgingâ s network leaves you staring at the spinning wheel of doom having mobile data to hot spot from your phone can save the day Note that if youâ re planning to stay in an out of the way accommodation ask about connectivity beforehand A good host should be happy to preemptively provide the screenshot of a speed test from fast com or Speed Test Rainstorms can also mess with the signal This is something to consider if youâ re visiting during hurricane season Donâ t count on wi fi being available or reliable in rural areas Are there any internet restrictions or censorship laws Internet access in Mexico is as liberal as free samples at a tequila â museumâ read shop in Playa del Carmen You can browse stream and post without worry If youâ re concerned about privacy and donâ t want your data floating around the digital ether using a VPN is a good idea especially on public networks Buy a local SIM or eSIM if you need wi fi at Mexico s ancient sites such as ChichÃ n ItzÃ Patryk Kosmider Shutterstock Can I stay connected at major tourist sites Itâ s best to assume there wonâ t be free wi fi at tourist spots such as national marine parks and archaeological sites Your mobile data will be your lifeline at such places Will I encounter language barriers when getting connected At destinations with plenty of international travelers like Puerto Vallarta staff at Telcel AT T MÃ xico and Movistar stores may speak some English If you venture into smaller towns or untrammeled villages learning some basic phone based Spanish will go a long way Memorizing the following phrases will set you in good stead â Recarga por favorâ â Top up please â Â CuÃ nto cuesta el chip â â How much is the SIM card â Â Tienes un chip de Telcel â â Do you have a Telcel SIM card If you are topping up your data plan online you can translate your entire web page into English using Google Chrome How much does it cost to stay connected in Mexico Telcelâ s Amigos Sin LÃ mite is the name to know when buying a local data plan Plans start at M US for lasting days and go up to for M around US for days with unlimited WhatsApp and social media use Data reloads are available at convenience stores like OXXO and Eleven larger supermarkets and online When recharging online on the networkâ s official site be mindful that foreigners may have problems with their international bank cards particularly if the billing address postcode has letters i e it is not entirely numerical eSIMs might run you a little more than a local SIM but are worth it for the convenience of topping up without ever going into a store or switching between plastic cards Mexico s cell phone etiquette is generally pretty casual Richie Chan Shutterstock What local tech customs or etiquette should I be aware of Mexico uses Type A and Type B power outlets with a standard voltage of and a frequency of North American visitors wonâ t need an adapter but Europeans and other travelers should pack one Phone etiquette in Mexico is casual Locals donâ t shy away from taking calls in restaurants or on public transport and people openly leaving extended voice notes is a common sighting Busy beaches may have rows of sunseekers playing different types of loud music on speakers How do I contact emergency services if needed Dial for help and have Google Translate ready if you donâ t speak Spanish The app lets you download languages for offline use In Mexico City the tourist assistance hotline number is or This article was produced by
