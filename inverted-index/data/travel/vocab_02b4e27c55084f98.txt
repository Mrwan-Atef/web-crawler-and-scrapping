There are plenty of ways to get around Mexico but taking the bus is usually your best bet Â MStudioImages Getty Images Mexico is huge From fluffy white ski slopes and thick steamy jungle to cacti strewn deserts and sublime stretches of untouched sand expect to use many transport options to get around the world s biggest country Between domestic flights long distance buses hair raising colectivo combi minibuses and â for one spectacular stretch â an old school passenger train there are plenty of ways to cross this North American behemoth you just need a little patience Here s how to get around Mexico You will probably end up spending a lot of your travel time getting to know Mexico s bus systems Â MStudioImages Getty Images Cheap and reliable make the bus your best mate With a good road network and comfortable frequent reasonably priced bus services connecting all cities buses are your bestie in Mexico Most cities and towns have one main bus terminal from which all long distance buses operate It may be called the Terminal de Autobuses Central de Autobuses Central Camionera or La Central not to be confused with el centro the city center Stations in major cities tend to be generally clean safe and highly functional Advertisement Generally known as camiones local buses are usually the cheapest way to get around cities and out to nearby towns and villages They run frequently and fares in cities are just a few pesos In many cities fleets of small modern microbuses have replaced the noisy dirty older vehicles Buses usually halt only at fixed paradas bus stops though in some places you can hold your hand out to stop one at any street corner Bus classes Deluxe Executive De lujo services primera plus and the even more comfortable ejecutivo executive buses run mainly on the busier intercity routes They are swift and comfortable with reclining seats plenty of legroom air conditioning movies on individual video screens few or no stops toilets on board sometimes separate ones for men and women and often drinks snacks and even wi fi They use toll roads wherever available Class Primera clase buses have a comfortable numbered seat for each passenger All sizable towns are served by class buses Standards of comfort are adequate at the very least The buses have air conditioning and a toilet and they stop infrequently They show movies on general screens and use toll roads where possible Class Segunda clase or buses serve small towns and villages and provide cheaper slower travel on some intercity routes A few are almost as quick comfortable and direct as class buses Others are old slow and shabby Few have toilets These buses tend to take non toll roads and will stop anywhere to pick up passengers so if you board mid route you might be standing for part of the trip In more remote areas these are often the only buses available Bus companies Mexico has hundreds of bus companies Many of the major ones belong to the four large groups that dominate bus transportation in different parts of the country ETN Turistar Serves major cities along the Pacific coast central northern and eastern Mexico and destinations as far south as Oaxaca Grupo ADO Connects Mexico City with numerous cities in the YucatÃ n Campeche Quintana Roo Tabasco Chiapas Oaxaca Puebla Guerrero and Veracruz Grupo Estrella Blanca Runs between Mexico City and the center north and west of Mexico Major cities include Guadalajara Tijuana Puebla Monterrey Puerto Vallarta and Ciudad JuÃ rez Primera Plus Destinations served around central Mexico include Mexico City Guadalajara MazatlÃ n Puerto Vallarta San Luis PotosÃ and San Miguel de Allende Buying bus tickets For class deluxe and executive buses buy your ticket at the bus terminal before the trip in some cities you can buy tickets from bus offices in central office locations It is also usually possible to purchase tickets online and be sent an e ticket or QR code for check in For trips of up to four or five hours on routes with frequent service you can usually just go to the bus terminal buy a ticket and head out without much delay For longer trips routes with infrequent service or for any trip at busy holiday times itâ s best to buy a ticket a day or more in advance You can usually select your seat when you buy your ticket Try to avoid the back of the bus which is where the toilets are located â it also tends to experience a bumpier ride Many class services have no ticket office you just pay your fare to the conductor Advertisement Tips for traveling by bus Buses do occasionally get held up or even robbed Traveling by day and on deluxe or class buses which use toll highways where possible minimizes this risk Buying tickets several days in advance or at less busy times of the day can often get you a discount fare Baggage is safe if stowed in the baggage hold â get a receipt for it when you hand it over Keep your most valuable possessions in the cabin with you Air conditioned buses can get cold so wear long pants or a skirt and bring a sweater jacket or maybe a blanket on board Eye masks and earplugs can be handy if you donâ t want to watch videos the entire trip Domestic flights can save you both time and money More than Mexican cities have airports with scheduled passenger services including Mexico City CancÃºn Guadalajara Tijuana Monterrey Los Cabos and Puerto Vallarta Flying can be good value on longer journeys and regional airlines have a decent safety record Flying may have a higher carbon footprint but if you have limited time in Mexico a domestic hop by air is preferable to a hour bus AeromÃ xico including its subsidiary AeromÃ xico Connect has the biggest network but TAR AerolÃ neas Volaris and VivaAerobus also serve many cities often with lower fares Other regional airlines are AÃ reo Servicios Guerrero Calafia Airlines and Magnicharters Taxis are a fairly affordable travel option in Mexico Â Richard l Anson Getty Images Taxis can be surprisingly cheap Taxis are common in towns and cities and they are surprisingly economical City rides cost around M to M per kilometer If a taxi has a meter you can ask the driver if itâ s working â Â Funciona el taxÃ metro â If the cab doesnâ t have a functioning meter establish the price of the ride before getting in this may involve a bit of haggling Many airports and some big bus terminals have a system of authorized ticket taxis â you buy a fixed price ticket to your destination from a special taquilla ticket window and then hand it to the driver instead of paying cash This saves haggling time and prevents major rip offs but fares are usually higher than you could get on the street Uber has become increasingly popular as well as a similar app based service Cabify Catch a colectivo combi minibus or pesero for short city trips These are all names for vehicles that function as something between a taxi and a bus running along fixed urban routes usually displayed on the windshield Theyâ re cheaper than taxis and quicker than buses They will pick you up or drop you off on any corner along their route â to stop one go to the curb and wave your hand then tell the driver where you want to go Usually you pay at the end of the trip and the fare a little higher than a bus fare depends on how far you go Renting a car or motorcycle in Mexico definitely gives you a lot more freedom Â Maria Sward Getty Images Use cars and motorcycles for more flexibility Having a vehicle in Mexico gives you a lot of flexibility and freedom With a little adaptation to local road conditions itâ s no more difficult than in most other countries The highways here are serviceable and fairly fast when traffic is not heavy There are more than of toll highways autopistas which are generally good four lane roads Tolls cost around M per kilometer You will need a valid driverâ s license from your home country and Mexican liability insurance to drive in Mexico If youâ re involved in an accident you can be jailed and have your vehicle impounded while responsibility is assessed If you are to blame for an accident causing injury or death you may be detained until you guarantee restitution to the victims and payment of any fines Adequate Mexican insurance coverage is the only real protection itâ s regarded as a guarantee that restitution will be paid Mexican law recognizes only Mexican motor insurance seguro so a US or Canadian policy even if it provides coverage is not acceptable to Mexican officialdom You can buy Mexican motor insurance online through the long established Sanbornâ s and other companies Try and avoid driving at night as unlit vehicles hard to see speed bumps rocks pedestrians and animals on the roads are common â and drunk drivers are more common General highway security is better by day Note that some hijackings holdups and illegal roadblocks connected with drug gang activities occur mainly in the north Car hire Auto rental in Mexico can be expensive by US or European standards but is not difficult to organize Many major international rental firms have offices throughout the country Renters must provide a valid driverâ s license passport and major credit card and they are usually required to be at least years of age sometimes â those aged may have to pay a surcharge Rent a taxi and driver Renting a taxi for a day long out of town jaunt generally costs something similar to a cheap rental car â around M to M Motorbikes hire Motorbikes or scooters can be rented in a few tourist centers Youâ re usually required to have a driverâ s license and a credit card However many renters do not offer any insurance Use ferries to get to and from the Baja Peninsula Vehicle and passenger ferries connect the Baja Peninsula with the Mexican mainland sailing between Santa RosalÃ a and Guaymas and from La Paz to MazatlÃ n and Topolobampo Not only do these save travelers the effort of going up and round the Gulf of California but they are often overnight which saves on a nightâ s accommodation Thereâ s only one train line â but itâ s well worth taking The spectacular Ferrocarril Chihuahua PacÃ fico runs through the Sierra Madre Occidental between Los Mochis and Chihuahua the luxury Chepe Express travels only between Los Mochis and Creel Itâ s one of the highlights of Mexico travel and the country s only remaining passenger train Accessible travel in Mexico Whilst there is an increase in wheelchair friendly companies offering trips and tours of Mexico â plus a proliferation of newer resorts and hotels with dropped curbs ramps and elevators â there are still a number of significant accessibility obstacles for independent wheelchair users to overcome In many cities the pavements are old and uneven with few or no dropped curbs Most public transport isn t wheelchair friendly either think stairs on the Mexico City Metro and no accessibility provisions on buses However some taxi firms and tour companies can arrange private transfers for wheelchair users if booked in advance For more details check out Lonely Planet s Accessible Travel page Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local
