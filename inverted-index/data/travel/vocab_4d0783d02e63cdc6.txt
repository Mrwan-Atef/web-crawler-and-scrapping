capital city Shoroq Galal Nov min read Share Once you ve visited the Pyramids in Giza it s time to get to know Cairo Shutterstock Once a month I swap a nightâ s sleep in a comfy bed for a stiff neck on a minibus traveling hours from Sinai to Cairo I leave behind the sea and mountains for noise and crowds Why Because of the experiences Cairo offers But also because Cairo is a friend a consistent

Cairo up close and personal Egyptian style Lace up your boots we are going for a walk Advertisement When to arrive The Egyptian weekend is Friday and Saturday though shop owners tend to take Sundays off This proposed trip is from Friday to Sunday so I ve arranged the visits so you can enjoy Cairo away from the crowds Though noise is an integral part of what makes Egypt Egypt You will enjoy your visit at any time of the year just not perhaps when the khamsin hot southerly winds are blowing How to get from the airport Cairo has two airports One everyone knows Cairo International and one most donâ t know Sphinx International At Cairo International youâ ll be able to pick up a regular white taxi or use apps like Uber and inDrive Alternatively pre book a London Cab for a more showy entrance Sphinx International uses a private taxi company but you can also order an Uber Pack good walking shoes â you will cover a lot of ground on foot in Cairo Shutterstock Getting around town Download Cairo maps onto your phone Google Maps or Maps me and walk Though Cairo is eminently walkable outside of June to August the summers are hot here and can reach C F the metro is your safe bet for all seasons Prices on ride hailing apps are higher than regular taxi fares but remain reasonable Where to stay Sleep in Downtown for its convenient location to the sights Madina Hostel near the Egyptian Museum has rave reviews Cecilia Hotel is a favorite option for those on a budget Across the river visitors who are looking to spend a little more will love the palatial terraces of the Marriott in Zamalek What to pack Bring long sleeves and bottoms for UV protection and modesty along with a sun hat and a water bottle A shawl is helpful for all occasions and a light jacket is recommended for the cool winter evenings Don t forget your personal medication and bring a pen â you ll need one to fill out your landing card or maybe even to sketch a weasel You ll see many of them in the city running away from cats Advertisement Spend your first day in Cairo exploring the treasures of the Egyptian Museum Orhan Cam Shutterstock Friday How to spend the day After a lavish breakfast at Oldish or Groppi Gardens saunter down Talaat Harb and cross Tahrir Sq to the Egyptian Museum Al Sadat metro Book online or pay on entrance cards only Guides charge around US per hour You can also buy a ticket

amaze even after hundreds of visits Dinner Head to Abou El Sid in Zamalek a seven minute walk from Safaa Hegazy metro Stand momentarily perplexed by a pair of vast black doors before mustering the courage to extend a palm and stumble into somewhere else entirely Cairo Choose from oxtail tagine walnut chicken and and other exquisite examples of Egyptian cuisine but finish with the scrumptious rice pudding The evening From Abou El Sid itâ s a two minute walk to Aisha Fahmy Palace which closes at Peruse the stunning art displays which was made up of nudes on our last visit and imagine this as your home by the Nile Next head to local pick Robaeyat Al Khyam a few minutes walk away for a reassuring cup of sahlab a milky hot Egyptian drink made from orchid tubers Admire the interiors of the incredible Mosque of Mohammed Ali in the Citadel Shutterstock Saturday How to spend the day From Downtown walk minutes to the Gayer Anderson Museum hopping between the alleyways in the neighborhood of El Sayeda Zainab Weave through market stalls and under ornate balconies to the former abode of Gayer Anderson soldier and antique collector This British pasha filled his century home with treasures and then in a departure from colonial tradition he left it all to Egypt in Ride a tuk tuk US down Sharia Al Ashraf past the shrine of Ibn Sirin famed interpreter of dreams and along the Mamluk era aqueduct up to the Citadel Spend an hour or three mesmerized by chandeliers and calligraphy on the floor of the Mohamed Ali Mosque A sidewalk from the Citadel snakes around to Sharia Al Azhar minutes past Al Azhar Park drop in to roll down the grassy slopes Dinner For dinner most fowl go to Egyptâ s most delectable pigeon eatery Farahat tucked away down a side alley off Sharia Al Azhar Youâ ll soon learn from the ambient sounds of crunches that Egyptians eat pigeon roasted or stuffed with rice whole bones and all between sips of pigeon orzo soup Evening Cross the road follow the underpass to the Wikala of Al Ghouri for a soiree of whirling dervishes at the Tanoura show In this Medieval caravanserai youâ ll be spellbound as much by the centuries old colonnades as by the dancers spinning in spiritual ecstasy The show starts at and tickets are US Get there for to secure your spot The Qalawun Complex is in the heart of historic Cairo Akimov Konstantin Shutterstock Sunday Breakfast Time for the full Egyptian Race to the first fava bean and falafel cart you see â they tend to be wooden and lavishly painted Begin a short list on day one I told you to pack a pen Youâ ll find the best

ticket US to access the main historical sites of Sharia Al Muizz Bab Zuweila and Beit El Suhaymi are separate For Al Muizz read Diagon Alley from Harry Potter but instead of broomsticks itâ s goblets of sugar cane and a thousand minarets Dinner Pass through Bab Al Futuh and indulge in some liver sandwiches at Baba Abdo This is Egyptian street food at its finger licking best Alternatively make for the elegant Naguib Mahfouz Cafe or kick back in the open air restaurant Saheb El Sa ada When peckish in Khan El Khalili be wary of waiters employing am dram tactics ask for prices in advance Night Fully satiated tumble tarboosh first into the bazaars on either side of Al Muizz End up at El Fishawi and become absorbed in this coffee house lauded by literary and military greats from Naguib Mahfouz to Napoleon Bonaparte Order a glass of helba hot fenugreek Bonaparteâ s preferred tipple and lose yourself in the rhythms of oud and tabla Egyptian drum The experience is unforgettable and
