called Indians of All Tribes IAT had taken over Alcatraz student groups were protesting the Vietnam War the Castro had become the capital of LGBTQIA America and fierce battles were waged downtown over affordable housing in ethnic enclaves like Chinatown as new skyscrapers shot up in the financial district Marginalized communities were finding their voices like never before and transforming the city in the process Amidst it all the Chicano movement was swelling especially in traditionally Latino neighborhoods like the Mission District Soon the rising sense of chicanismo would change the face of

their lives in San Francisco In Chicana artists Patricia Rodriquez and Graciela Carillo met at the San Francisco Art Institute and by the two formed Mujeres Muralistas the women muralists The project

chapter in both murialismo and San Francisco s local art scene Within a few years artist René Yañez who was previously instrumental in the formation of the Mexican American Liberation Art Front MALAF
