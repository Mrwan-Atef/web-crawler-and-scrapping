Celebic Dec min read Share Dubrovnik is the beating heart of an exciting region that calls for more than just a mini break Â urbazon Getty Images Gorgeous Dubrovnik bundles UNESCO listed heritage with verdant nature a stunning coastline with fascinating villages an enthralling history with Game of Thrones oriented pop culture and a plethora of options with a laidback vibe At the southernmost point of Croatia Dubrovnik is cut off from the motherland by a small nook of Bosnia Hercegovina that bisects the Croatian coast and it s also the countryâ s last town before Montenegro Within these international borders Dubrovnik was once an independent republic and today it s the pulsing heart of an exciting region that calls for more than just a mini break Advertisement Here s what you should know before you go Head up to SrÄ hill for dazzling panoramas of Dubrovnik Â Samantha Ohlsen Alamy Stock Photo Plan to see more than just the old town and to put in some time Many visitors to Dubrovnik make the mistake of thinking thereâ s not much more to the town than the whitewashed walled city This UNESCO World Heritage site is the cityâ s symbol and a bucket list item for travelers all over the world so make the most of it before venturing further afield Spend a day or two exploring the grid of stone streets and taking in the fascinating sights from palaces towers and churches to Game of Thrones Kingâ s Landing backdrops Marvel at the carpet of terracotta roofs from the city walls then head up to SrÄ hill for dazzling panoramas that showcase Dubrovnik beyond its historic core In Bay the port you can roam the green and fish markets travel back to the Yugoslav era at the Red History museum and dance to DJ spun beats at Klub Dubina Soak up colorful sunsets from the Lapad Bay seafront and take a dip at one of the many pebbly beaches Hop a ferry to nearby Lokrum or venture out to serene Mljet Island and its forested national park Sip bold red in the wineries on PeljeÅ ac Peninsula and discover folklore in the Konavle Valley all while indulging in the easygoing local lifestyle Avoid hassles at the border by checking the entry requirements first Â Dallas and John Heaton Getty Images Beware of the borders If you re driving from Split to Dubrovnik or if you intend to visit the Ottoman gem of Mostar you ll have to cross the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina and visiting the stunning Kotor requires crossing the border with Montenegro To avoid hassle and disappointment start your planning by checking the entry requirements first Advertisement For worry free travel from Split to Dubrovnik consider swapping the wheels for a catamaran like Krilo then island hopping along the way Beachwear slip proof footwear and layers are the key to smart packing The locals in Dubrovnik dress casually but stylishly Your suitcase should feature the summer classics from shorts and airy dresses to all things sun and beach from bathing suits and flip flops to hats shades and sunblock Don t forget to pack a light scarf and a rain jacket for breezy evenings and summer showers In September and October layers that account for the wind and rain are the way to go At all times bring slip proof footwear as the shiny limestone streets are notorious for being slick at the slightest drizzle Book accommodations and restaurants in advance Arriving in Dubrovnik spontaneously and hoping to find a place to stay in the high season is pretty much a recipe for disaster Small and popular Dubrovnik gets busy and fully booked easily especially in luxury hotels and popular private accommodations Same goes for popular restaurants if your palate yearns for a certain place make a reservation a few days ahead to avoid disappointment except for the Michelin starred which you should book a month in advance Compact and scenic Dubrovnik is very walkable Â DarioZg Shutterstock Walk or take a bus but never ever drive to the old town One single lane road leads to the old town and at its end scarce and expensive parking is highly unlikely to be available So swap the drive for a stroll or a bus ride compact and scenic Dubrovnik is very walkable and the public bus network covers the city areas very well In the old town keep your clothes on and mind your manners While it may be easy to confuse all of Dubrovnik for a beach the old town is a lived in neighborhood with schools churches and institutions so remain respectful at all times An authentic reenactment of Game of Thrones Cersei s walk of shame might sound fun but visitors to the old town are expected to remain fully clothed at all times If visiting churches honor the sacred space by covering your shoulders and taking off your hat Refrain from using your phone turn your ringer off and never sightsee during service Be mindful when asking questions about the war The Yugoslav attacks and the shelling from to left Dubrovnik shattered and deeply wounded This is not a topic to be approached lightly you may ask questions in a respectful manner but be aware that some people prefer not to talk about it The Dubrovnik card grants entry to sites like the Rectorâ s Palace Â Roman Babakin Shutterstock Get a Dubrovnik Card Many find the prices of attractions around Dubrovnik to be on the higher side but the Dubrovnik Card grants access to the main sights plus free bus tickets and discounts in shops and restaurants Depending on whether you go for a one day three day or seven day card it ll include entry to the city walls and museums like the Rectorâ s Palace or the Franciscan Pharmacy plus discounts for Lokrum and Mljet Island Pay by card but tip in cash Tipping isnâ t mandatory but it s generally expected and much appreciated In restaurants the magical number is around while in bars you can round up the bill Aside from Amex credit cards are widely accepted but you ll need to carry cash for tips as it s rarely possible to add it to the credit card slip Donâ t be surprised when asked whether youâ re paying with cash or card before seeing the bill Croatian tax authorities require input of that information before the bill is printed You ll See This Everywhere in Croatia Coffee Culture Nurse your espresso and steer clear of to go cups Croatians take drinking coffee seriously This is a favorite local pastime and social ritual so if you re invited for coffee try not to pass Whether you take an espresso or bijela kava latte sip it slowly and never take it in a to go cup Ditch bottled water and refill on fountains Tap water is drinkable in Dubrovnik and in the old town you can refill your bottle from the fountains like the two Onofrios which have the coolest water around Relax and enjoy but exercise common sense With a tight knit community and generally well lit areas Dubrovnik remains a very safe city both day and night While hard crime is low do exercise common sense when in crowds as pickpockets turn up on occasion Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan
