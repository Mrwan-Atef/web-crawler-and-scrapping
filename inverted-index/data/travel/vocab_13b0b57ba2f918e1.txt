Aug min read Share Follow these tips on health safety and etiquette for the best travel experience in Australia Stanislav Fosenbauer Shutterstock As an Australian living in New York in my early I found myself fielding a wide range of questions about my home country Some were amusing others were downright bewildering â Do you ride kangaroos to school â â Are there drop bears in the woods â â Are Australian dollars really called â dollarydoosâ â Australia can feel like an enigma particularly for foreign travelers It s a land filled with myths and misconceptions that could fill volumes and the idea of Australia being a homogenous country is far from accurate In reality it s a diverse mix of cultures and ethnicities with a rich Indigenous history spanning tens of thousands of years Australian cities are multicultural hubs and most Australians live in vibrant urban centers â a sharp contrast to the rugged Crocodile Dundee stereotype This abundance of misinformation can make it challenging to prepare for a trip Down Under To help you separate fact from fiction and ensure a smooth and enjoyable visit here s a localâ s guide to Australia and its people including top tips on health safety and etiquette Pick the best time for your visit based on the region not the country as a whole Shutterstock There is no â rightâ time to visit Australia Australia is almost as big as the United States with everything from lush rainforests to snowy alps The weather varies significantly depending on where you are in the country and the time of year The Northern Territoryâ s Top End remains hot year round with only two distinct seasons the â wetâ season and the â dryâ season In contrast New South Wales experiences everything from blisteringly hot days during the summer to sub zero temperatures during the winter Even the Red Centreâ s temperatures range from C F to over C F throughout the year Think regionally when considering when to visit and pack accordingly To catch Uluru at its best for example opt for cooler months between May to September to avoid walking the base on a scorching day In Tasmania coastal heaths bloom from late October to early November while food festivals are held from March to May Winter is when Tasmania and the mountainous regions of New South Wales and Victoria experience snowfall Meanwhile visitors might find themselves cooling off in ocean waters along the East Coast year round Save up for your dream Australian holiday Australia isn t known for being budget friendly particularly in cities such as Melbourne and Sydney Iconic experiences like four wheel driving across Kâ gari formerly Fraser Island or snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef can be expensive with tours and experiences costing hundreds of dollars per person However smart planning and a clear budget can help you make the most of your money Many of Australia s top outdoor attractions are free from scenic drives along the Great Ocean Road to swimming at Bondi Beach Don t expect to encounter a kangaroo on the city streets John Crux Photography Getty Images Get out of the city to see a kangaroo Kangaroos aren t a common sight on bustling city streets â but you donâ t necessarily have to â go bushâ to see them Instead you ll find them in suburban areas including on golf courses where they love to congregate on the links However most kangaroo encounters usually happen during hikes or on road trips through regional landscapes especially at dusk and dusk when theyâ re most active Farm stays are also a great option if you want to see more of Australiaâ s wildlife And before you ask Yes you can eat kangaroo Itâ s delicious Be prepared to talk to strangers on the train Aussies are incredibly friendly and enjoy a good chat You might find someone starting a conversation with you on a train or even stopping you on the street for a quick â chinwag â Australians are also known for their courtesy and manners They ll hold doors open and if you re in their way they ll step aside As a visitor it s important to be mindful of your surroundings and return the favor by holding a door or an elevator â it s a small gesture but it means a lot Australians speak an entirely different kind of English Australians are renowned for their own unique take on the English language and youâ re going to encounter a lot of slang from locals Regional variations also exist so if you meet someone from outback Queensland theyâ re going to sound a little different to someone from Brisbane The best way to stay connected Saily provides a hassle free solution to travel data â just choose your data plan and prepare for your trip When you get to your destination you can go online right away Get your eSIM â Arvoâ good afternoon is not to be confused with â avoâ avocado You buy booze from the â bottle oâ and get â pettyâ petrol or gas from the â servoâ service station Many words are abbreviated with an â oâ or â ieâ added to the end Endearing terms like â mateâ are also common but phrases you likely wonâ t hear from anyone under the age of at least are â crikeyâ or â fair dinkum â One thing you will hear Colorful language Donâ t be surprised or take offence if you catch an Australian dropping a swear word during a chat Itâ s normal Australia s Indigenous population is made up of hundreds of distinct groups evantravels Shutterstock Australia is home to the oldest continuous living culture in the world Australia s Indigenous population includes both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders This population is not a single group but rather a rich tapestry of hundreds of distinct groups or â nations â each with their own languages histories and cultural traditions That means not every group plays the didgeridoo or uses a boomerang During your visit youâ ll have the opportunity to learn more about the traditional landowners with Aboriginal museums and art galleries dotted across the country Indigenous led tours â including those that are part of the Discover Aboriginal Experiences collection â are a great way to learn more The Great Barrier Reef is vulnerable â but itâ s not â deadâ The Great Barrier Reef â arguably Australiaâ s most iconic attraction â made headlines in when reports claimed it was â deadâ following coral bleaching events Thereâ s no question that climate change has had an adverse effect on the Great Barrier Reef In addition to increasing water temperatures the vulnerable ecosystem has also been impacted by pollution from land run off and the increasing severity and frequency of cyclones However the Great Barrier Reef is more resilient than you think Itâ s also far from lifeless If you dive into the water you may see evidence of bleaching events but youâ re just as likely to see colorful corals teeming with life Increasingly visitors can also get involved in reef restoration including by participating in citizen science surveys such as Eye on the Reef Walking around barefoot is normal Be prepared to see many Aussies strolling around barefoot even in cities and public places such as grocery stores cafes and hardware stores Why It all comes down to beach culture which has a way of spilling over into everyday life whether thereâ s sand and salt water present or not Most people won t encounter dangerous wildife in Australia Joao Inacio Getty Images Keep a sense of perspective about crocs snakes and spiders Despite the famous belief that all wildlife Down Under is out to get you a study conducted by Melbourne University researchers found that horses have caused more deaths in Australia than all the venomous creatures â including snakes and spiders â combined The reality is that crocodiles aren t wandering the streets theyâ re only found along coastlines and waterholes in the northern parts of Western Australia the Northern Territory and Queensland and youâ re more likely to encounter possums and harmless insects in buildings Just be cautious of swooping magpies if you re in parks between August and October This is when theyâ re breeding and are protecting their eggs or newly hatched chicks Restaurant kitchens close between and Australia s urban and rural areas have their own life rhythm In cities restaurants tend to wrap up service by but it s as early as in rural areas Nightclubs and bars close around What catches many travelers off guard is that there s also a mid afternoon dead zone between and when the majority of cafes and restaurants are closed Even the kitchens in pubs may not do food service at this time If youâ re after something to eat between these hours fast food is your friend Tipping is not expected in Australia Australia s minimum wage is higher than in many countries At the time of writing the national minimum wage is per hour As a result tipping isnâ t customary in Australia although that s beginning to change in larger urban centers like Melbourne as all service charges are already factored into the cost of your meal However if you genuinely wish to show appreciation for outstanding service tipping is at your discretion Meat pie Vegemite and chicken salt are must try foods Australia lacks a single defining cuisine but few things are as quintessentially Aussie as tucking into a steaming meat pie traditionally served in a paper bag with a generous squeeze of tomato sauce ketchup It s a deliciously messy experience and an integral part of Australian food culture Vegemite is also a must have experience Spread a thin layer â thin being very important â on toast for a salty kick Speaking of salt chicken salt on hot chips fries is a near obligatory and delightful initiation for newcomers This seasoning has been a popular add on to fries since it was launched in Australia in By the way itâ s usually vegan There s often no actual chicken in it just a lot of MSG Cover up in a stinger suit when swimming on the Great Barrier Reef as jellyfish can give a painful sting chameleonseye Getty Images Snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef requires covering up Are you excited about that cute holiday snap snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef Donâ t spend too much time selecting a bathing suit for photo ops as nobody will see it Thatâ s because from May to November it s stinger jellyfish season in tropical north Queensland You ll need to don a rather stylish stinger suit supplied by your tour boat operator complete with a hood and mitten like hand covers It might look a bit peculiar but it s your best defense against the venomous and often hard to spot irukandji and box jellyfish that lurk in the water It s much better than the alternative â getting stung Walk on the left On sidewalks trails and stairs sticking to the left helps maintain a smooth flow of foot traffic and prevents any awkward dance moves with strangers trying to pass Some train stations have arrows to direct the flow This practice also aligns with Australia s left hand driving tradition According to the UKâ s National Motor Museum driving on the left may have emerged as a safety measure particularly when the main road hazard was highway robbery Travelers would pass oncoming strangers on their right side keeping their sword arm toward the passer by Don t worry you won t be jousted in Australia The Outback can be unforgiving Don t underestimate the harshness of the Australian Outback Although it covers roughly of the Australian continent only around of the population lives there For those unprepared for its remote conditions it can also present danger A broken down car for example could lead to heat exhaustion dehydration or worse So if you re planning an independent outback road trip â to the Nullarbor Plain or Flinders Ranges for example â do your research and prepare for anything and everything Stock up on water go slow especially on gravel roads and let someone know your plans because the phone signal is spotty at best For added safety consider a personal locator beacon to instantly alert emergency services in case of trouble If that sounds daunting countless tour operators are pros at taking tourists â safely â through these iconic landscapes Beware of dangerous currents when swimming in the ocean The primary danger for swimmers at Australian beaches isn t the wildlife it s the perilous underwater currents known as â rips â Rip currents have the potential to pull swimmers out to sea and are typically found in areas with underwater sand banks that obstruct the free flow of water back to the shore Not every beach is patrolled by lifeguards so it s best not to risk it if you re not a confident swimmer Just dip your ankles in for the same feeling Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off
