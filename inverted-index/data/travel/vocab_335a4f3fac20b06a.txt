Dublin that locals love Sasha Brady Dec min read Share The Palace Bar in Dublin is one of the city s most authentic and traditional pubs Shutterstock Dublin has no shortage of proper pubs the kind where the smell of turf and a good pint greet you as soon as you walk in the door Some look like they ve been lifted off the set of a period drama with flickering candles shelves cluttered with old matchboxes and postcards and dusty glass bottles so thick with wax you d swear they were holding the place together If that s the sort of vibe you re after hereâ s a guide to some of my favorite old school pubs in the city These places are the real deal and cater to everyone from families to solo visitors and non drinkers Whether you re meeting friends catching live music or sitting quietly with your thoughts and a book the focus is always on a cozy inviting atmosphere Clockwise from left Memorabilia on the walls of Johnnie Fox s the polished wood interior of The Palace Bar and the fire roaring in Johnnie Fox s Sasha Brady for Lonely Planet Laid back Victorian pubs McDaid s In the city center you re spoiled for choice One of my favorites is McDaid s a subdued Victorian bar on Harry St with stained glass windows and dark wood interiors It used to be one of Irish writer Brendan Behan s favorite pubs and interestingly it was once the city morgue adding to its moody ambiance Advertisement Top spot for food nearby Coppinger Row for bistro style fine dining Bowe s I also love Bowe s on Fleet St which is all wood and brass with an excellent whiskey selection It can be quiet during the day when you ll hear nothing but the rustling of a newspaper but if you sit at the bar you ll likely end up chatting with someone within minutes Top spot for food nearby D Olier St to indulge in a Michelin starred course tasting meal The Oval Another excellent Victorian era recommendation is the Oval near the GPO which my co worker Ru Ogata loves When there are no sports on the TV it s usually nice and quiet and I always get a seat unlike a lot of the old Victorian style pubs she says Top spot for food nearby They serve food here try the Irish stew or full Irish breakfast The Long Hall Artur Widak Getty Images Sheehan s If you re looking for a pub with a similarly relaxed vibe where you can sit and chat without the roar of music Ru also recommends Sheehan s near the Westbury Hotel because it s cozy and never seems to be too busy Top spot for food nearby Glas a standout vegetarian and vegan restaurant Haritgan s Hartigan s near St Stephen s Green and the Museum of Literature Ireland is another inviting spot that describes itself as a country pub in the city It does feel like that inside with decor that seemingly hasn t changed in years It has literary connections too with a mention in Flann Oâ Brienâ s At Swim Two Birds Top spot for food nearby F X Buckley a much loved steak restaurant The Long Hall The Long Hall on South Great George s St is a must visit too but aim for a weekday you absolutely will not get a seat here at the weekend when there s nobody around so you can appreciate how beautiful the interior is which has been pretty much the same since the late Top spot for food nearby Big Fan for Hong Kong inspired small plates The Swan About a five minute walk from The Long Hall is another beloved Victorian pub The Swan Bar It dates back to the with a marble bar mosaic tiled floors and polished woodwork that haven t changed much in over a century Visit on a quiet weekday night when you can snag a table by the fire Top spot for food nearby Dublin Pizza Company for Neopolitan style pizza that you can back to the pub Advertisement Kehoe s is a traditional Irish Pub and a local favorite Lively traditional city center pubs Kehoe s Just off Grafton St you ll find Kehoes a place everyone loves especially for its Guinness This means it s often crowded but the atmosphere is buzzy and the staff are nothing is too much trouble friendly even when the place is rammed The interiors are weathered but well kept with faded couches that you ll easily sink into in the parlour room upstairs and a dusty piano that I ve never seen in use Top spot for food nearby Library Street a restaurant and wine bar with French and Italian influences Grogan s Grogans receives similar praise for the quality of its stout Known for its well worn charm many Dubliners claim there s no better spot than its front terrace on a sunny day Dubs say this about many places but I ll say this is true about Grogans My colleague Alex Butler refers to it as the people s living room saying it attracts all sorts and is the one pub where I always end up chatting with strangers It s great at any hour of the day any time of the year Top spot for food nearby Stick around for Grogan s famous cheese and ham toastie The Stag s Head I feel like I ve met everyone I ve ever known at some stage in The Stag s Head Tucked away on Dame Lane it s perfectly placed for a pit stop in town Outside buskers perform on the cobbles while inside the great stag s head on the wall keeps an eye on everything Top spot for food nearby Good World for dim sum The International The International is a pub where the characters you meet are as much part of the draw as the drinks Last time I was there an older man regaled me with tales of playing piano for Barry Manilow Were any of them true Highly doubtful Did I care Not at all Itâ s that sort of place â full of stories even if theyâ re probably invented Top spot for food nearby Uno Mas for jaw droppingly good Spanish inspired tapas The Palace Bar is one of the few locally loved Temple Bar pubs Tony Quinn Shutterstock The Palace At some point you might find yourself in Temple Bar perhaps visiting well known spots like the Temple Bar pub or Gogarty s Although these places are fine besides their exorbitant prices they re not where you ll typically meet locals Instead consider heading to the Palace My friend Josh calls it the only authentic pub in Temple Bar It s known for its literary history having been a favorite of writers such as Patrick Kavanagh Seamus Heaney and Flann O Brien Head straight to the back room which is a great people watching spot Top spot for food nearby The Winding Stair for elevated but homey Irish cuisine McNeill s Or wander down the road to McNeill s on Capel Street This is a tiny place with tight corners and narrow aisles so you ll likely have little choice but to spark conversation with the people shimmying up beside you It started off as a music shop about years ago and the music tradition is still strong with regular live trad sessions Top spot for food nearby Aobaba for affordable Vietnamese food Toner s Toner s on the south side of the city is an institution always busy and known for having one of the best snugs in town It s widely believed that W B Yeats who was not known for propping up a bar made an exception for Toners There s a brilliant beer garden out the back and on match days â especially when there s rugby on â it s absolutely buzzing Top spot for food nearby Toner s serves excellent Neopolitan style pizza from nearby Cirillo s in the pub Or you can try Etto for rustic sit down Italian The Cobblestone is a cornerstone of Dublin s traditional music scene Schager Shutterstock Cozy pubs that are worth the detour Walsh s Just outside the city center in Stoneybatter about a five minute walk from the Jameson Distillery is Walshs The pub is a favorite of the Lonely Planet Dublin office staff and we frequently take visitors there Amy Lynch the Destination Editor for Ireland calls it her favorite pub in Dublin noting great Guinness always a good atmosphere and good tunes a few nights a week Top spot for food nearby Italian restaurant Grano if you can snag a reservation or Hakkahan for Sichuan style Chinese food Delaney s However when Walshs becomes too crowded to be fun a short walk around the corner leads to Delaney s My colleague Dan Bolger recommends this no frills traditional pub for its laid back atmosphere and a good mix of locals and students comfortable seating and excellent beer garden Top spot for food nearby Seafood and wine bar Fish Shop The Cobblestone Not far from there is the Cobblestone which most Dubliners consider one of the city s best traditional music pubs Here you can enjoy a drink while listening to the sounds of fiddles and bodhrÃ ns every night of the week â and it s easy to bond with the people around you when you re all wrapped up in the music playing in front of you Top spot for food nearby Sister for Asian inspired small plates The Gravediggers feels like a traditional country pub in Dublin Brian Lawless Getty Images John Kavanagh s aka The Gravediggers When you re on that side of the city you should also call out to John Kavanagh s about minutes on the bus from the city center Better known as the Gravediggers this pub is built into the walls of Glasnevin Cemetery and close to the Botanic Gardens It s always busy with regulars whom staff in the family run pub know by name The decor is the epitome of old school Ireland with rickety stools and swinging doors that open into traditional snugs often with a fire burning and a dog to pet Top spot for food nearby The Gravediggers serve food like Irish tapas and their famous Dublin coddle Old Royal Oak Across the river the Old Royal Oak near Kilmainham Gaol and the Irish Museum of Modern Art offers a similarly inviting and traditional country pub ambiance in the city In our guidebook to Ireland we mention that locals are fiercely protective of this gorgeous traditional pub and even though it s on the tourist trail it s still sort of hidden away down a country style lane which adds to the allure My colleague Amy Lynch loves this one too because it s cozy friendly with a gorgeous nook that s perfect for reading on a Sunday afternoon Top spot for food nearby for casual and hearty food Johnnie Fox s Johnnie Fox s in the Dublin Mountains holds the much disputed title of Ireland s highest pub It s been around since and is crammed with bric a brac and artifacts like Edwardian costumes and Revolution era posters It definitely caters heavily to tourists and everyone from Brad Pitt to the King of Spain has visited but Dubliners love it too Because of its layout you ll quickly get talking to people whether it s a family sitting down to Sunday dinner with live music or people returning from a hike Top spot for food nearby You can stay here Johnnie Fox s serves traditional Irish food including shepherd s pie and beef and Guinness stew Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Ireland Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For
