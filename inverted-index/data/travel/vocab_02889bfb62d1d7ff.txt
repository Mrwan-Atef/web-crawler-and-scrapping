These remote Inca ruins rival Machu Picchu TRAVEL BEST OF THE WORLD These remote Inca ruins rival Machu Picchu A trek high in the Peruvian Andes reveals dazzling ancient buildings stellar views and mysterious llama art In the Peruvian Andes the ruins of the ancient Inca settlement of Choquequirao can only be reached by foot or mule though a proposed cable car could make the site more accessible By Lucien Chauvin Photographs by Victor Zea Díaz October min read Llamas seem to graze everywhere in Peru s mountains but none of them are quite as memorable as the herd at Choquequirao a sprawling pre Columbian archaeological complex in the southern Andes Here white rocks embedded in the walls of gray schist stone terraces depict two dozen llamas impressing tourists and archaeologists alike There is nothing else like this in the Andes Unique rock art embedded in stone terraces at Choquequirao depicts a parade of llamas There is nothing else like this in the Andes It was an artistic innovation that occurred prior to the century and was never repeated says Gori Tumi Echevarría who specializes in prehistoric rock art and has worked at the site since the llamas were unearthed in Choquequirao or Choque to locals is a cousin to the more visited Machu Picchu Built by the Inca it includes ceremonial halls chambers that once held mummies intricate farming terraces and hundreds of buildings where ancient peoples worked and lived The llamas in a perpetual procession toward the ruin s central plaza where their real life relatives would have been sacrificed are the star attraction Choquequirao is one of best places to visit in See the full list here The route to the foot high Choquequirao is not for the faint hearted It takes most hikers two or three days to trek there and back along a mile trail that often hugs the cliffside as the Apurímac River rages below The route is strewn with rocks and lined with thorny branches A couple of trekkers return to Capuilyoc camp one of the first way stations on the route to Choquequirao A muleteer and his horses are shown on the path to Choquequirao While many travelers hike the mile high altitude route to and from the ruins others ride pack animals for some or all of the journey Thick stone walls and terraced construction characterize the settlement of Choquequirao which scholars believe the Inca built in the and centuries But every stubbed toe and scratched arm is worth the views of the snow dusted Andes breathtaking pastures and enigmatic structures along the way Choquequirao is accessible only by foot human or mule That could change if Peruvian authorities agree on a proposal to create a cable car to ferry visitors to the base of the ruins Proponents claim the cable car would increase tourism and bring in revenues without halting trekkers in the process Opponents argue that the cable car would not only spoil Choquequirao but that it could also make the entire complex collapse For now the site s remoteness and the difficulty reaching its ruins help it retain a magical mythical quality But will progress change all that A mythical cradle of gold Choquequirao translated as cradle of gold in Peru s Indigenous Quechua language sits along a route used by pre Columbian people to move between Andean peaks and jungle lowlands Both it and Machu Picchu miles northeast were mapped in the by American explorer Hiram Bingham who led four expeditions to the area sponsored by Yale University and the National Geographic Society Zoom in for more detail The two sites have evolved quite differently since Bingham s mapping efforts By the Machu Picchu was heralded incorrectly as a lost city causing a spike in tourism The terraced complex became Peru s postcard to the world a mountaintop citadel accessible by trail or by a train bus combination In it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list and the number of travelers increased further In the first six months of the site attracted nearly visitors according to Peru s Trade and Tourism Ministry How to explore the Inca Trail beyond Machu Picchu Choquequirao in contrast only received trekkers in the first half of this year That s not the only difference While most visitors to Machu Picchu transit through the small town of Aguas Calientes also known as Machu Picchu Pueblo with its plentiful food and lodging the route to Choquequirao lacks many creature comforts Getting there is as many prefer an adventure Treasures yet to be discovered As with Machu Picchu Choquequirao shows the progression of Inca construction techniques beginning with simple stone structures and evolving to finely hewn massive blocks that interlock like puzzle pieces The heart of Choquequirao with its mummy niches and ceremonial sacrifice platform is smaller than what tourists see at Machu Picchu but the complex itself is much larger Tourists and their guide explore the upper section of the Choquequirao archaeological site The complex is larger than Machu Picchu though less of it has been excavated Pablo Guevara a tourist from Cusco visited Choquequirao in May Choquequirao s size and remoteness mean that much of the site has never been excavated Nelson Sierra who operates a high mountain trekking company Ritisuyo points to vine covered elevations rising beyond the central clearing They are not small hills but collapsed structures reclaimed by dense vegetation So much work is still needed here but restoring it all would be a massive job he says As trekkers approach the ruins the first thing they see are terraces step like platforms that turn hillsides into arable land still used by farmers in highland Peru Choquequirao has miles and miles of them most still buried The terraces stretch from the top of the ruins nearly a mile down toward the Apurímac River Check out other adventure trips on our Best of the World list Mabel Covarrubias whose family has lived in the nearby community of Marampata for more than a century says her ancestors used the terraces for planting and pasturing livestock until the Work on the terraces led archaeologists to the stone llamas Their white stone bodies stand in stark contrast with the gray walls suggesting depth and dimension They reflect the sunlight when the rays first hit them each morning Echevarría says the llama terraces may have been built as a symbolic offering to the sun god even when no actual live animals were available for sacrifice Stickers cover a sign for the Choquequirao ruins Like many people who live on the route to Choquequirao Samuel Quispe works in tourism catering to trekkers with an overnight camp and horse and mule transportation Yain Tapia looks out on his hometown the village of Marampata It s one of a handful of places with services for trekkers on the trail to Choquequirao That conjecture is one of a long list of suppositions about the site Many myths exist around Choquequirao says Echevarría Indeed Bingham and a number of explorers and researchers have floated theories about Choquequirao s origins its relationship to other ruins and the role it played during the Inca Empire First there s a foundation myth holding that Manco Inca the century Inca resistance leader holed up in the citadel here for part of the years he waged a guerrilla war against the Spanish It is a nice story but it has nothing to do with reality says Echevarría I have no doubt that Manco Inca was in Choquequirao like he was at Machu Picchu but it was not built for the resistance These side trips from Machu Picchu include wild rafting and monkey spotting Samuel Quispe who has worked as a guard guide and restorer at Choquequirao since the posits that the complex was built by the Chanca rivals to the Inca in the neighboring Apurímac region in the and centuries Echevarría disputes that theory believing the majority of the structures went up during the expansion of the Inca Empire in the century The cable car conundrum Uncovering the llamas focused new attention on the ruins and created the most recent myth one that continues to gain traction because of Peru s messy politics Former first lady of Peru Eliane Karp was instrumental in securing financial assistance to ramp up the restoration of Choquequirao in Now she and her husband former President Alejandro Toledo are under suspicion for alleged corruption While none of the allegations relates to Choquequirao the controversy has thrown everything the couple did while in power into question Rumors abound that Karp helicoptered into Choquequirao to fly out crates of golden artifacts Tourists take in a view of Choquequirao from one of its many terraces Karp did not cart off gold but she did push for a cable car to access Choquequirao In theory the tramway could be good for Peruvian tourism and local economies But it continues to divide communities archaeologists and politicians who must approve its funding A potent argument and one that has raged around Machu Picchu is the impact of tourists on the ruins In UNESCO threatened to put Machu Picchu on a danger list because of the number of visitors A cable car system would not only bring more visitors to Choquequirao but also the sort of infrastructure that might damage the fragile site Some complain that mass access to the sacred site could spoil its remote undiscovered appeal and the grassroots tourism outfits that now bring people here Melchora Puga who offers lodging and a restaurant in Chiquisca on the Apurímac side of the trail worries the cable car would force her and others to abandon their way of life We depend on tourism The cable car would be like killing the roots of a tree and thinking the tree could live We would not survive says Puga Construction workers erect a new building in Marampata a village near Choquequirao with tourist lodgings and restaurants Travelers Etienne Casas and Lea Luong eat dinner with local guide Jorge Luis Roldan at a camp in Marampata less than two miles from Choquequirao Quispe now a semi retired mule driver says the cable car would eliminate the livelihoods of a range of service providers whose businesses would be bypassed by a quick cable car ride One of his seven children José Luis is a mule driver while another works for the government project restoring more of Choquequirao s terraces The family runs a small store and campground in Cocamasana along the trail The cable car remains in limbo But this doesn t bother most hardcore trekkers The enticing thing about Choquequirao is that it takes time so there is a commitment to do it says Madison McDonald from Houston Texas who visited Choquequirao in May Ritisuyo Travel s Sierra says the government should focus on improving the existing infrastructure instead of arguing over a cable car Maintenance of the trail and better services would permit a greater flow of tourists and ensure local livelihoods It would not be like Machu Picchu but the people visiting Choquequirao are not interested in another Machu Picchu Choquequirao is the perfect companion site IF YOU GO How to get there Cusco Peru is the gateway to Choquequirao From the colonial city it s a four hour bus or car ride along a paved highway to Cachora feet above sea level where the trailhead is located A number of companies such as Ritisuyo Salkantaytrekking and Intenseperu offer guided treks What to expect The trek to Choquequirao is rigorous and while it can be done in two days a minimum of three is recommended to spend quality time at the ruins The altitude begins at feet at the trailhead and goes up and down as low as feet This can be a factor for many trekkers particularly those who haven t adjusted yet The first day you ll trek from Cachora straight down to Chiquisca feet close to the Apurímac River Lodging food and drink are available You can overnight in Chiquisca or continue to the campground at Santa Rosa feet or to Marampata feet which also offers rooms and food Choquequirao is about a two hour hike from Marampata After visiting the ruins either stay in Marampata or head back to Chiquisca Be aware of time and know that the sun sets around p m most of the year as the site is about degrees south of the equator Climbing over rocks in the dark is risky Hiking boots and poles are a must as are a flashlight sunblock and insect repellant Tours Tours including porters and mule teams are widely available to escort you from Cusco to Choquequirao and back Seasoned trekkers utilize the four sites along the trail offering food beverage bathrooms and lodgings A three day tour with a porter runs around per person If you go solo there is a entrance fee Lucien Chauvin is a writer and frequent contributor to National Geographic based in South America Victor Zea is a photographer in
