Could Slovenia s Karawanks range offer Europe s best hut to hut hiking trail TRAVEL Could this be Europe s best hut to hut hiking trail On the northwest border of Slovenia is a mountain range as dramatic as it is accessible offering hut to hut hiking on multi day adventures with plenty of hearty food and local tales to sustain the journey The summit of Mount Stol is the highest peak of the Karawanks reaching high Photograph by Francesco Lastrucci By Duncan Craig Photographs by Francesco Lastrucci October This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK The crowds that flock to Lake Bled like parched game to an African watering hole don t bother Simon Koščak in the slightest He watches them with perplexed detachment from his lofty vantage point six miles away and more than up This is Roblekov Dom Slovenia s prettiest and most totemic mountain hut Attend any folk festival in these parts and it won t be long before the strains of Na Roblek bom odšel I m going to Roblek fill the clear mountain air Most Slovenes know it by heart It s a song about romantic love of a young man whisking his lover to this forest fringed eyrie high up in the Karawanks range But more than that it s a paean to the mountain culture that underpins so much of Slovenian life The building itself dark wood exterior gabled roof at least two sizes too big is blessed with an imperious setting a sun splashed ridge on the southwest flanks of Mount Begunščica It sleeps and has a terrace that seats perhaps double that As hut manager Simon is here year round He gets some support at weekends but mostly it s just him and the incessant all consuming peace A chopper drops off supplies every days It lands out front on a makeshift grass helipad no bigger than an allotment plot At other times Simon might trek up the corkscrewing path from the valley with a backpack stuffed with all the ingredients sausages beans and sauerkraut for jota the traditional Slovenian stew that s a staple of mountain menus When it s quiet he takes breakfast out on the terrace feasting on views that stretch from the alluvial plains of Ljubljana to the south east past the coach tour frenzy of diminutive forest fringed Lake Bled and on to the snow capped peaks of the Julian Alps beyond He can go days without a guest Our arrival ends one such hiatus thick cloud and intermittent drizzle keeping the early season hikers at bay Simon greets me and my trekking guide Boštjan Mikuž with a warm handshake and mindful that it s as near as damn it midday a shot of bitter liquor made from the root of the great yellow gentian flower which grows in the alpine pastures here During the busy season Roblekov Dom mountain hut cooks meals a day some consisting of soup with beans potatoes cabbage and sausage Photograph by Francesco Lastrucci Simon Koščak manager of Roblekov Dom hut greets guests with a shot of bitter liquor made from the root of the great yellow gentian flower which grows in the alpine pastures Photograph by Francesco Lastrucci Fifty year old Simon has oval features eroded into a craggy amiability He exudes an air of unhurriedness that seems to permeate the entire cabin At length he cooks up some steaming jota and pulls up a chair at our table uninvited yet entirely welcome Through the window the cloud begins to dissipate like a demisted windscreen and we see flashes of those fabled views When the sun comes out it can get busy says Simon following my gaze Cooking meals a day is not unheard of But when the weather draws in so does the peace Then I m alone he adds Alone with nature When we come to pay Simon waves away the money with a dismissive waft of the hand shakes our hands again then insists on escorting us down to the junction of the path a few hundred feet below lest we miss the turning for our onward route Just a couple of days into my week long hike one thing is already abundantly clear hospitality is not something Slovenia s nationally treasured network of mountain huts takes lightly The Alps of old The cartographical resemblance of Slovenia to a chicken is something that once pointed out is impossible to ignore The head thrusts eastwards into the rump of Hungary the tail feathers rub up against Italy to the west and the slender feet are cooled by the northernmost waters of the Adriatic Continuing the conceit the Karawanks the w is pronounced as a v before you worry define the bird s lower back This east west range traces the border with Austria for nearly undulating miles frequently sheer and austere on the northern neighbour s side sloping and carpeted with grass and wildflower meadows as it descends into Slovenia These are the easternmost remnants of the Alps the last hurrah of a mountainous mile arc that stretches as far west as Nice Everything about Slovenia is painless for the traveller from the efficiency and near ubiquity of English to the compact scale And that seems to extend to its topography too There are more than mountains over yet none breach All are linked by clearly defined brightly waymarked trails And crowds particularly in this range are as rare as a Slovene who doesn t own a pair of hiking boots For a hobby hiker blessed with reasonable fitness and perhaps some trekking poles for the occasional steep descent it really doesn t get much better Signposts mark the path through the Karawanks mountain range The Karawanks are basically the French Alps of years ago Boštjan tells me as we depart the riverside town of Tržič a minute drive north of Ljubljana on the opening day of our trek Tall upbeat and unflappable he s preposterously overqualified for what lies ahead A fully fledged mountain guide one of only around in the country Boštjan organises ultra marathons as a sideline and his idea of a relaxing break is a hour climbathon on unsummited peaks in Patagonia By contrast we re hiking a little over miles in five days and eating sufficient amounts of strudel to immobilise an Alpine ibex But like many Slovenes Boštjan is palpably eager to show off his country The drama begins almost immediately Close to two thirds of Slovenia is forested much of this unbroken swaths of pine spruce oak and beech But the treeline only extends to around above which a geological smorgasbord emerges At times we find ourselves on sunlit richly grassed plateaus specked with white daffodils and purple crocuses Ten minutes later we might be picking through an angular and forbidding landscape with gnarled fingers of limestone thrusting into the sky and pockets of unmelted ice clustered around their knuckles My first scree crossing lends a frisson of excitement to day two As we approach from a distance the narrow path is little more than a pencil squiggle bisecting the vast steely grey bowl of loose stone As I step gingerly across Boštjan suddenly gestures for me to stop A small cube of rock bounces down the slope ahead and takes a dozen or so other scraps of scree with it on a clattering journey to the base of the degree slope We look up to see a brace of short horned chamois scuttling away on the ridge line like pranking adolescents Painted on rocks and trees along our route are trail markers a white dot in a red circle This is the Knafelc blaze named for the Slovene cartographer and mountaineer who devised it a century ago It s simple conspicuous and of huge symbolic value to Slovenes who ve fought and died in these peaks over the centuries and clung to their mountain identity when the country was subsumed into Yugoslavia for much of the century Mountain guide Boštjan Mikuž grew up in Slovenia and now leads tours trekking through the Karawanks range As we hike Boštjan reminisces about his family s experience living under Marshal Tito and the handbrake of communism Profits from his father s business were capped Western luxuries could only be purchased by stealing over the border to Italy Twenty years into Slovenia s EU membership it all feels a very long time ago The point is emphasised by our fellow guests at our first mountain hut Planinski dom na Zelenici up in a clearing beneath Mount Begunščica Stepping into one of Slovenia s best equipped cabins we find the corridors of the dorms lined with combat fatigues American accents are heard Italian too A NATO training exercise it transpires or at least the downtime following one The local Laško beers are lined up and a rowdy but good natured evening ensues Early the following morning I wake to find the entire unit has dispersed without trace Only the faint echo of Bon Jovi hanging in the mountain air suggests they were ever here It s a frat party special forces style The reclaimed peace gives me a chance to chat to hut manager Petra Malavašič She s got a big smile and an eyebrow stud and she tells me has worked here for three years The demands of the summer season hours a day for four months are compensated for by the setting and the free time that follows Holding a spiralling finger to her temple and smiling she says It helps to be a little crazy A turbulent history Certain qualities are evident in all the mountain huts we visit over the five days They re invariably snug and welcoming Crocs are provided to stop you traipsing bits of hillside through the fastidiously cleaned corridors And the strip your own beds and muck in etiquette is scrupulously adhered to Yet each has its own distinct identity one that stems from a combination of the personality of the manager or managers and the setting The following evening having puffed our way through a short but challenging mile section we find a winning blend of the two Gathering cloud swallows the sun as we climb almost to the summit of Mount Stol the high point of the Karawanks Suddenly a mini blizzard is whipping across our faces flakes of ice merging with the delicate white flowers sprinkled over the high mountain slopes There on an exposed outcrop just down from the peak is the faintest of outlines The wind brings with it the smell of wood smoke Fighting to stay on our feet we push on towards it prise ourselves through the door and step into the snug serenity of Prešernova koča na Stolu Warming the cabin s single communal room with its partitioned tables and checkered tile floor is a huge wood fed heater encased in lime green ceramic tiles engraved with viticultural scenes The centrepiece of Slovene houses in a pre central heating age these ovens would occupy a corner in each room to evenly spread the warmth Both my grandmothers had one says Bostjan affectionately Hut managers Jožko and Kata Šumanovac a retired couple welcome us warmly We sit with our backs to the tiles as a beaming Kata serves us restorative coffees and apple strudel From a little bed beneath my feet emerges the couple s Pekingese and Maltese mix Poopie who fusses around the newcomers as Kata fondly chides her Her name we re reassured to learn was given rather than earned Built in the hut was named for the de facto national poet France Prešeren who wrote the lyrics to Slovenia s fervently internationalist national anthem It was razed to the ground by partisans in the Second World War preventing the Germans from capitalising on its elevated and thus strategic position then rebuilt in the and enlarged in the This eventful history is catalogued in a series of framed pictures over which I linger before retiring to my bunk and sleeping the heavy sleep of the hiker as the icy wind rattles the dorm windows Save for Jakob a studious Swiss on a trans Alpine multi stage hike from Vienna to Nice we re the only guests Lake Bled a famous tourist destination in Slovenia marks the end of the Karawanks range trek Photograph by Francesco Lastrucci Dawn summit If you don t like the weather in the Slovenian mountains to bastardise Mark Twain just wait a while So it proves as we wake to a dazzling sunrise clawing its way up through the peaks to the east and flooding the plain far below with a soft light The clarity is extraordinary with my naked eye I can pick out the burgundy roof and white tower of the island church on Lake Bled A steep craggy path takes us the last few hundred feet to Stol s summit where a smooth limestone slab is marked with Oe Austria on one side of a slender line and RS Republic of Slovenia on the other Already here is a lone hiker I m momentarily puzzled It s not yet and the closest other accommodation is multiple miles away Anticipating this spectacular dawn it transpires he hauled himself out of bed before and hiked up from the valley floor Shortly he ll retrace his steps he tells us before heading into the office I think you call that work life balance The mile stretch that follows proves the best of the hike A light breeze takes the edge off the temperature the steep undulations of the previous days level off and we re left with just a triumphal ridge path through pastures grazed by alpine sheep and thick haired horses that regard us with commendable indifference Below us to one side the entirety of Slovenia seems laid out for inspection To the other the southern lowlands of Austria through which the Drava river meanders eastward to converge with the Danube A smattering of hikers begins to materialise then a chap labouring under the weight of a mountain bike clasped to his shoulder He gives us a sheepish smile You re not actually allowed to bike on these trails Boštjan whispers when the man is out of earshot although we both agree that his efforts probably deserve at least one good downhill run Our last mountain night is spent at Koča na Golici a hut that sits in such splendid detachment on a spur beneath Golica a peak that we watch it draw nearer over the course of at least six miles It s certainly no anticlimax to reach it Hut manager Janez Zore long blonde hair wispy beard capable manner is playing Slovenian rock music and cooking up aromatic dishes of zelje s klobaso in ocvirki a sausage and cabbage concoction enlivened with chunks of crispy pork fat We re too late for the scented white narcissus flowers that carpet the steep slopes above the cabin Janez shows us pictures of the hail storm that had laid waste to one of Slovenia s most spectacular natural sights the week before But not for the fieriest sunset of the trip which draws us out on to the slender wooden balcony We stand in silent admiration watching the sky s purples and burnt oranges coalesce around the distinctive three pronged silhouette of Mount Triglav Slovenia s flag decorating national symbol The final day brings a significant drop in both elevation and mood Ribno Alpine Resort which we reach via a wooded descent accompanied by a snowmelt fed waterfall and a taxi transfer from the peak rimmed town of Koroška Bela is the perfect spot for post hike recovery There s a natural pool glamping treehouses with hot tubs bubbling away on their balconies and soothing wood framed suites But leaving the resort and strolling around nearby Lake Bled is an oddly depressing affair While the lake itself is still a marvel half a square mile of satin smooth emerald ruffled only by the flat bottomed pletna row boats that have plied the waters for at least years I quickly tire of the crowds I find myself casting wistful glances at the horizon and the immense inscrutable contours of Mount Stol and its attendant peaks Squinting through the mid morning haze I fancy I can make out Simon Koščak sitting on his sunlit terrace outside Roblekov Dom a coffee in one hand and a bemused smile playing across those genial features How to do it OutventureX offers a five night hut to hut self guided hiking tour from per person minimum two people with airport transfers map GPX files of the route and
