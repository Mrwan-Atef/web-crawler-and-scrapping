Fionn Davenport Apr min read Share Front doors in Dublin s Portobello neighborhood Ruben Earth Getty Images Dublin is one of Europeâ s most walkable capitals where youâ re never far from the action No matter where you stay exploring the best of the city is effortless Irelandâ s capital is a collection of neighborhoods each with its own distinct character and energy Many started as villages on the cityâ s edge but as Dublin grew they were absorbed into the urban landscape but have managed to retain much of their individual identity A simple way to navigate Dublin is to think of it in two halves â northside and southside â divided by the River Liffey which cuts through the heart of the city Another handy trick is to use the postcode system even numbers Dublin etc are on the southside while odd numbers Dublin etc are on the northside The further you go from the city center the higher the numbers climb Advertisement Whether you re here for the history the culture or the craic hereâ s a rundown of some of the best neighborhoods in Dublin for your next stay The Glimmer Man pub in Stoneybatter noel bennett Getty Images Stoneybatter Best for gay culture great food and good pubs Two decades after young creatives first flocked to Stoneybatter this once working class neighborhood has cemented its place as one of Dublinâ s go to spots for laid back nights out and great eats in the cityâ s unofficial â gayborhood â It may not boast headline attractions but the National Museum of Ireland and the Old Jameson Distillery are just a short stroll away in Smithfield What Stoneybatter does have is food â really good food Start your day at Slice one of the cityâ s coziest brunch haunts or settle in at Grano for some of the best Italian fare this side of Calabria Rumor has it the ownerâ s mother still flies in from the old country to keep the pasta game tight Right next door is its chic little wine bar A Fianco offering Italian wines and small plates with the spicy suasage dish scaldanduja earning top marks Other options include Korean Table dishing up award winning KFC thatâ s Korean Fried Chicken while pastel pink Hakkahan puts a fresh spin on Chinese favorites â donâ t miss the salt and pepper squid On the drinks front L Mulligan Grocer helped kick off Dublinâ s gastropub movement and still delivers with craft beer and comforting plates For something more eclectic the Glimmer Man pub brings old school drinking vibes and flavors of Asia with its courtyard food truck Vietnom serving bold mostly veggie Vietnamese street food from Thursday to Saturday Oh and if you like your pubs traditional Walshâ s is the spot even if the clientele is anything but Stoneybatter is a great place to stay start by looking on Airbnb The area is a warren of petite Victorian terraced streets â what the houses lack in space they more than make up for by having the city on the doorstep and Phoenix Park as a garden Planning tip Struggling to find somewhere to sleep in Stoneybatter Nearby Smithfield has a lot more options for overnight stays The iconic gates to the Guinness brewery in the Liberties neighborhood Evan Hammonds The Liberties Best for old Dublin charm brewery and distillery tours Advertisement Follow your nose and you might catch the rich malty scent of roasted barley drifting through the streets of Dublin â welcome to the Liberties one of the cityâ s oldest and most storied neighborhoods Once set just outside the medieval city walls this is Auld Dublin at its most authentic While the past couple of decades have brought plenty of change â new cafes design studios and distilleries â the Liberties still holds tight to its gritty charm and unmistakable local soul Once youâ ve ticked off Dublinâ s two iconic cathedrals â St Patrickâ s and Christchurch â itâ s time to shift from the sacred to the spirited Just down the road the legendary Guinness Storehouse awaits Once the cityâ s biggest employer itâ s now Dublinâ s most visited attraction drawing pilgrims of a different kind But beer is just the beginning This neighborhood was once the busiest distilling district on the planet and the tradition is alive and well The new generation is doing it with style Teeling Distillery Pearse Lyons Distillery and Roe Co are all crafting world class spirits in sleek state of the art spaces keeping Dublin firmly on the map for modern day whiskey lovers What is also booming is the food scene From beloved neighborhood cafes like the Fumbally and Two Pups to Michelin starred Variety Jones thereâ s no shortage of good eating Space Jaru which began life at city markets has found a permanent home here dishing up Korean comfort food like bulgogi grilled meat tteokbokki rice cake and of course that crispy KFC For lunch on the go Bakeology brings a slice of Argentina to the Liberties with sweet and savory treats while local institution Catherine s remains a dependable favorite Coke Lane slings some of the best pizza in the city out the back of Luckyâ s on Meath St The kitchen at cultural and events space Henâ s Teeth is always buzzing and always inventive try the food truck style Japanese grub When it comes to pints and plates Spitalfields and the Tenters lead the gastropub charge the latter part of the stylish Aloft Hotel arguably the pick of the hotels that seem to be eating up the local real estate For drinks Fallonâ s is a no frills classic and Dudleyâ s â though it looks like itâ s been here forever â is a smart newer addition that fits right in Portobello in Dublin Kris Dublin Shutterstock Portobello Best for food and drink Trace a semi straight line from Dame St all the way to the Grand Canal and youâ ll hit Dublinâ s vibrant bite and sip zone Portobello in Dublin The cityâ s tastiest postcode is where people come to swap spreadsheets for spritzes amid the largest concentration of effortlessly cool dining and drinking spots Aungier St becomes Wexford St and then is suddenly Camden St but youâ ll hardly notice for the number of options that line them Uno Mas slings a squid a la plancha grilled squid good enough to make a Barcelona food critic smile while for Chinese food with attitude and a dose of neon Hang Dai and Big Fan have people lining up for a table For filthy burgers in the best way thereâ s Bunsen on Wexford St and around the corner Dash Burger which serves smash patties so good they should come with a warning Lena overlooking the canal is the neighborhoodâ s go to for elegant Italian cooking while Bastible offers a refined take on modern Irish cuisine complete with a Michelin star For something more relaxed Bibiâ s and Alma are beloved brunch favorites and Little Bird focuses on seasonal organic ingredients with a yoga studio tucked upstairs The Bretzel Bakery has been baking since back when Portobello was known as Little Jerusalem â the Irish Jewish Museum just a couple of blocks away offers a thoughtful glimpse into that history open Sundays only Across the road Lennox Street Grocer stocks excellent wine freshly baked bread and a tempting selection of treats Thirsty locals are well catered for â Anseo the Irish for here pronounced un shuh brings laid back dive bar energy with plenty of character while Frankâ s offers a more refined experience with a carefully curated wine list in a beautifully pared back setting Planning tip If youâ re serious about tasting the best of Dublin a word of advice get your spreadsheet out and make bookings early because youâ ll be elbowing for space with locals and evening and weekend tables can be hard to come by The Portobello neighborhood is more long term residential than a base for short stays look to the perimeter of the neighborhood for hotels around Charlemont Harcourt St and Christchurch The Stella Cinema in Rathmines Ross Mahon Shutterstock Rathmines Best for shopping cinema and food For a night at the movies with serious style Rathmines delivers Dublinâ s most luxe cinema experience Once a hub for students the neighborhood now leans more toward young professionals with a taste for good cocktails and better interiors Case in point the Stella Cinema a beautifully restored art deco gem where you can sink into plush velvet seats and enjoy table service as you watch Upstairs the cocktail club keeps the vintage glamour alive with moody lighting and expertly mixed drinks Just across the street the Swan Centre might look unassuming but step inside and youâ ll find a well curated mix of shops â Flying Tiger Bow Pearl and one of the cityâ s top charcuterie counters tucked inside Dowling Butchers Around the corner April and the Bear is stocked with chic furnishings quirky decor and covetable housewares Fancy a dash of culture with your retail Swing by Brighton Sq birthplace of James Joyce in February The house itself isnâ t open to the public but the setting â leafy peaceful and overlooking Kenilworth Sq â is a quietly lovely spot for a literary detour If wings and a boozy brunch are calling your name Farmer Browns and Elephant Castle remain tried and true favorites But for something with a bit more personality head to Ernestoâ s Coffee Artisan Foods one of Dublinâ s most distinctive cafes Here the owner fuses a passion for Cuban culture with a deep love of Dublin GAA serving up traditional Irish breakfasts Latin inspired sandwiches and rich single estate Cuban coffee all with serious neighborhood charm One of the best avocado toasts in town is slung at Grove Road while Mad Yolks dishes free range egg sandwiches homemade hash browns and some tasty mimosas The glasshouse at the National Botanic Gardens in Phibsborough Davi Costa Shutterstock Phibsborough Best for a student vibe Once a blink and youâ ll miss it corner of the northside Phibsborough Phibsboro in Dublin is quietly stepping into the spotlight with its indie cafes buzzy new restaurants and a low key creative vibe This old school neighborhood is unpolished unpretentious and unexpectedly cool â just how the locals like it It s located between two big university campuses and a mix of students young professionals and families call this are home Sights worth visiting include the historic Glasnevin Cemetery and the National Botanic Gardens Sports fans should take in imposing Croke Park the home and headquarters of the Gaelic Games Association GAA Inside is a sports museum and you can take stadium tours and skyline trips along the top of the stands Two Boys Brew brings a slick Melbourne meets London energy to the neighborhood with bold coffee creative brunch plates and a line most weekends Bang Bang keeps things casual but quality slinging knockout sandwiches and sharp Silverskin espresso The Bernard Shaw and its sidekick Eatyard are still student staples for drinks and street food while Mosaic Wines ups the game with low intervention bottles charcuterie and a soundtrack that doesnâ t try too hard Beyond the cafes youâ ll find standout dishes at Lorettaâ s a slick spot with American leanings and serious kitchen chops Gastropubs like the Botanic and Doyleâ s Corner keep things hearty â Doyleâ s got a fresh spin in when it was snapped up by Dublin singer songwriter Gavin James For a proper no frills pint to go with your pub grub the Bohemian â affectionately known as the Boh â delivers high Victorian ceilings solid IPAs and the kind of unpolished charm that was never meant to be cool yet somehow is Itâ s an old style pub by design but you ll find just about everyone squeezed in Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Ireland
