Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan Located in the Tempozan Harbor Village area of Osaka Bay Kaiyukan is Japanâ s most impressive aquarium and one of the largest in the world Visitors head to the eighth floor to start the tour and gradually spiral downward floor by floor around the central tank There are around other tanks each representing a specific region of the Pacific Rim Some tanks stretch across several levels allowing guests to observe creatures from different depths and perspectives The route through Kaiyukan ends at the touch pool where it s possible to touch rays and small sharks in shallow water Advertisement Getting there Osaka Metro Chuo line Osakako Stn min walk Build new worlds in Legoland Discovery Center Also in the Tempozan area by Osaka Bay Legoland Discovery Center is full of fun for the whole family with Lego racing model building workshops Lego themed rides like Kingdom Quest where guests hop aboard a chariot to rescue a princess and a Duplo farm for smaller

Universal Studios is divided into nine zones Hollywood Universal Wonderland The Wizarding World of Harry Potter Amity Village Waterworld Jurassic Park San Francisco Minion Park and New York Itâ s impossible to visit all nine zones in one day but timing your trip to USJ on a weekday rather than a weekend will help to reduce the crowd factor Pre booking your ticket online is also a good idea to avoid having to line up at the front gate and if you donâ t mind spending the extra cash it can be well worth buying a USJ Express Pass to avoid having to queue up for every ride An alternative is the USJ VIP Wristband Pass a cheaper option than the express pass whereby instead of gaining priority access to selected rides you are allowed to enter USJ minutes to one hour earlier than the regular crowd This means you get to jump on at least two rides without waiting before the masses rush in Advertisement Getting there JR line Universal City Stn min walk Get hands on at Kids Plaza Osaka An
