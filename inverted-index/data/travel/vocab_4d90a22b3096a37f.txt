How cruise ships are sailing again during coronavirus TRAVEL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Why cruise ships are setting sail again as COVID rages The surreal world of cruising during a pandemic requires temperature checks at meals pre boarding virus tests and masks on the dance floor An employee in protective gear sprayed disinfectant on pool lounges aboard the MSC Grandiosa in October One of the world s largest cruise ships the boat normally holds more than passengers but during the COVID pandemic it was generally sailing at percent capacity Photograph by Davide Bertuccio By Rachel Ng Photographs by Davide Bertuccio December min read When you take a cruise during a pandemic daily activities look and feel quite different from pre COVID times Breakfast is served at socially distanced tables after a pre meal temperature check At night you can dance at a club provided you cover your face and give other passengers a wide berth The pool is open kept clean by staffers in face shields and protective jumpsuits who also spray the lounge chairs with disinfectants Before March a cruise ship worker in a hazmat suit would ve seemed straight out of a high seas horror movie But for people traveling during a pandemic like Victoria Balabaeva such precautions seem assuring It made me feel safe seeing how seriously the ship is taking health protocols said Balabaeva who in September after months of lockdowns in her native Italy joined or so other passengers for an eight day trip on MSC Cruises MSC Grandiosa The ship set off from Genoa to destinations including Naples and Malta one of the first sailings since the pandemic started An indoor gym on the MSC Grandiosa was converted into a makeshift COVID testing clinic Photograph by Davide Bertuccio In October masked guests onboard the MSC Grandiosa wait in a socially distanced line to putt on a mini golf green Photograph by Davide Bertuccio Cruise ships made headlines early in the year when they became floating coronavirus superspreader events forcing crew and passengers to seek medical attention evacuate or quarantine and leading to cases and at least reported dead in the U S alone Now with new safety protocols and far fewer passengers on board a handful of jumbo ships like MSC Grandiosa and Royal Caribbean International s Quantum of the Seas have resumed sailing from European and Southeast Asian ports How they re doing it and what passengers think previews how the billion industry might chart a recovery in and beyond The ships slowly come back In late cruise ships still aren t docking or taking off from United States ports On November the U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that all people avoid travel on cruise ships including river cruises worldwide because the risk of COVID on cruise ships is very high But in Europe and Asia a few cruise lines resumed operations this summer German based Hapag Lloyd Cruises was one of the first sailing out of Hamburg starting in July New safety precautions onboard included a mandatory health questionnaire staggered boarding daily temperature checks and reducing its passenger load by percent Before boarding each guest limited to residents of Germany Austria and Switzerland had to provide proof of a negative COVID test The company also installed an onboard testing lab and hired doctors and nurses to travel with the ship Cold fog machines that spew antiviral disinfectant were used to clean cabins and public areas So far after completed trips carrying more than guests no COVID cases have been reported Guests aboard the Grandiosa must reserve solo time slots to use the hot tubs Photograph by Davide Bertuccio The MSC Grandiosa cruise ship s theaters remain open but seating has been staggered to prevent the spread of COVID Photograph

Finland s Tallink Silja line resumed voyages in May and hasn t had any known outbreaks Though the company operated overnight cruises between Nordic countries before the pandemic it s currently offering only two hour nature trips around the northern Baltic Sea region It prepped for new normal voyages by installing handwashing stations limiting ship capacity and adding plexiglass shields to customer stations Masks are recommended during boarding and disembarking Related How to stay healthier on a cruise ship Other lines including Royal Caribbean MSC Cruises and Dream Cruises require temperature checks a slate of COVID tests onboard and timed reservations for pool and gym access Buffet stations are no longer self serve and safety muster drills training on evacuation protocols are streamed on stateroom TVs instead of happening in person Crew members are usually tested and quarantined prior to boarding the ship What it s like onboard now Rebecca Wong was one of people who boarded Dream Cruises World Dream on November the first ship to restart service from Singapore since spring During the day she scaled a rock climbing wall played miniature golf and tried out archery Special safety ambassadors milled around making sure people didn t cluster in large groups and reminding them to wash their hands However in the evenings Wong missed the live entertainment canceled for now on World Dream It felt a little strange not to have music and karaoke in the lounges she said It felt so empty Otherwise she found cruising wasn t starkly different from before the health crisis Balabaeva has been on more than cruises including on MSC ships The biggest difference she found was the lack of other people I almost had the whole ship to myself she said One of the five largest ships in the world MSC Grandiosa can accommodate more than passengers During the pandemic it s sailing at around percent capacity MSC Grandiosa cruise passengers admired the sunset during a October voyage Photograph by Davide Bertuccio Seats in its massive auditorium are blocked off and dining tables are spaced out to allow for more social distancing People were doing the same things as before said Balabaeva Food and entertainment were still good and we got more space onboard so that s a plus Many of these new practices like limiting capacity or restricting sailings to people from certain countries are being implemented temporarily and aren t economically sustainable in the long term said Chris Gray Faust managing editor of online industry publication Cruise Critic The current measures are a way to help get this industry back on its feet while still delivering a safe and healthy experience she said After months of solitude in Milan Italian photographer Davide Bertuccio was glad to be around other people on his inaugural trip aboard Grandiosa in October Being able to take a break and look at the immensity of the sea during this terrible year made me feel lucky he said However he feared contracting the virus so Bertuccio avoided talking and mingling closely with other guests Seeing people having to abide by the rules was the sad thing he said Objectively this pandemic is making our normal something with an undertone of sadness Nothing is the same as before Balabaeva who shares her cruising videos on YouTube said she felt safer in some ways on the boat than she did at home in Turin Everyone had to pass a COVID test before boarding she said That doesn t happen on land so you could meet a COVID positive person that has never been tested pretty much in any public place I d rather wear a mask onboard and enjoy a sea breeze from my cabin balcony Still COVID s long incubation period and the fact that rapid tests can be unreliable means a pre boarding negative could turn into an on deck positive While she missed the usual cocktail gala and didn t like the slowed by social distancing buffet lines Balabaeva enjoyed herself so much that she booked two more future cruises She isn t the only person eager to get back on the water Cabins are selling out on ships that have resumed sailing in Europe and some parts of Southeast Asia Passengers wore

the captain and other crew members Photograph by Davide Bertuccio Port stops and shore excursions Cruise lines claim they are creating social pods or bubbles by only allowing passengers and crew who have tested negative for COVID aboard However once travelers disembark to explore any port cities along the route they risk bursting those bubbles To protect the health of guests and the local community companies such as Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line are stopping only at private islands usually owned by the cruise lines or forgoing ports completely on cruises to nowhere Note Cruises to nowhere have been banned in the U S since due to complex immigration issues Other cruise lines such as MSC attempt to make offshore excursions safer with sanitized socially distanced transportation and guides who have tested negative for COVID In some cases passengers must take a rapid COVID test and receive a negative result before coming back onboard The ability to book an independent excursion or explore on your own is not currently an option for some European cruise lines said Gray Faust Passengers who leave the group tour might not be allowed back on the ship said cruise expert Stewart Chiron of The Cruise Guy a booking and news platform Another potential complication when cruising during COVID A country could implement a nationwide lockdown while a ship is part of the way through its itinerary For example MSC and Costa were both forced to retool Mediterranean routes when Greece went back into lockdown on November France and Germany are also currently in a second wave of partial lockdowns Navigating the various destinations that cruise ships visit is still a work in progress and a significant focus of the lines at this time said Gray Faust So far the lines sailing in Europe have done a great job but it does require cruise lines and passengers to be as flexible and nimble as possible The giant screen above the main pool of the MSC Grandiosa

by Davide Bertuccio Cruise tech harnessed for safety Over the past few years cruise lines have invested in new technologies to streamline guest experiences Royal Caribbean gives each passenger a snap on electronic wristband that unlocks their stateroom door facilitates cashless purchases and pre registers them for boarding Princess Cruises similar OceanMedallion even enables guests to locate their family or friends around the ship Now those same technologies are being used to protect guests and crew through the pandemic said Gray Faust Things like electronic wristbands that were meant to deliver a more personalized experience are now capable of assisting with contact tracing The technology can also help crew staff identify if there are too many people gathered in one place and encourage them to spread out Related Will new travel technologies invade your privacy In addition paper menus have been replaced with scannable QR codes and facial recognition is being implemented at check in The onboard experience is more contactless than ever said Gray Faust Some of the cleaning technologies the airline and hotel industries have harnessed during the pandemic are also being used including improved air filtration systems UV wands to sanitize common areas and cabins and automatic handwashing stations How safe is it Despite all these precautions the return to cruising hasn t all been smooth sailing Small outbreaks have been reported including crew members and guests who tested positive on Norwegian cruise ship MS Roald Amundsen on July and seven passengers who tested positive on Costa Cruises Costa Diadema on October The Quantum of the Seas briefly confined passengers to their cabins when a single case was detected onboard December in the end the ship returned to port early River cruisers have also been exposed to the coronavirus Gulls graced the horizon as the MSC Grandiosa departed the port of Naples Italy in October Photograph by Davide Bertuccio These cases have stirred up memories of the nightmare scenario that plagued the Diamond Princess earlier in the year The site of the largest COVID cluster outside of Wuhan China the luxury cruise ship had all the trappings of a disaster flick Passengers quarantined aboard for almost four weeks before they were allowed off By then the number of passengers and crew who tested positive for a new potentially deadly coronavirus had jumped from to more than more than a dozen of those who caught the coronavirus died Related What happens when a cruise ship becomes a viral hot zone In total more than cruise ships have reported COVID positive cases among their passengers and crew as of May Those cruise ships did not handle the crisis well said Dr Arthur L Reingold division head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health No one was paying attention to any safety measures which is why the virus spread so quickly The SeaDream I the first ship to resume sailing in the Caribbean made headlines when seven guests and two crew members tested positive for COVID The debacle has been blamed on the lack of a mask mandate onboard and the fact that passengers did not follow the pre cruise day quarantine requirement in Barbados The inexpensive antigen tests administered by some cruise ships are not always reliable false negative results may be as high as percent according to Science magazine Related Can testing and quarantining making travel during COVID safer Even with the reported outbreaks Chiron feels confident If I had the chance I would have gone on a cruise months ago he said It s a completely erroneous statement to compare ships to a petri dish He s not alone When Royal Caribbean put out a call in November for volunteer passengers for a simulated voyage to test out safety protocols set forth by the CDC more than people signed up Epidemiologist Reingold maintains that if people follow the safety measures social distancing frequent handwashing and proper mask wearing the risk of exposure on a cruise ship is very low However he cautions that safe is a relative term nothing we do in life is absolutely safe One of the extra measures Reingold suggests is to avoid mingling with strangers in group activities and to only socialize with your cruise partner or immediate family Related vintage photos remind us of the glamor of travel of Brownsville Texas Women in period dress greet travelers arriving on a Pan Am flight Photograph by B ANTHONY STEWART Nat Geo Image Collection Recent news of three potentially effective vaccines from AstraZeneca Pfizer and Moderna has been welcomed by the battered cruise industry Stock prices for Carnival Corp Royal Caribbean and Norwegian surged almost percent and bookings increased However Chiron believes cruise lines need to resume operations without relying on vaccines No business should plan anything surrounding a magic antidote he said There are too many unknowns Having a vaccine available will likely be an added layer of safety and confidence for guests but I wouldn t be surprised if some of the new measures might continue even after the pandemic said Gray Faust Things like staggered embarkations and virtual muster drills also solve previous onboard pain points Likewise buffets with servers are perceived by many people as more sanitary If measures deliver an enhanced and healthier experience they could stick around When will U S ships cruise again When the no sail order issued by the CDC expired on October U S cruise operators were given a framework for conditional sailing and COVID testing requirements Now that the CDC has elevated the travel warning for cruises to Level the highest no one can predict when cruise lines in the U S will start sailing again The incoming Biden Administration might also want to implement new guidelines Whatever happens travelers are eager to return to the seas According to a recent Cruise Critic reader survey percent of U S cruisers will book a future cruise and nearly half of respondents are already looking to book one even if it won t sail for months to come Bottom line When the industry is ready to return safely said Gray Faust it will have cruisers ready to sail Davide Bertuccio is a Milan based photojournalist Follow him on Instagram Rachel Ng is a Los Angeles based writer and editor who
