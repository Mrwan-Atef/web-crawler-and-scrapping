activities you can do without a tour guide will stretch your budget in Costa Rica Â Krysia Campos Getty Images Itâ s easy to experience sticker shock when checking into eco lodges renting vehicles or booking tours in Costa Rica Indeed it is the most expensive country in Central America thanks to a booming economy and well developed tourist sector But there are plenty of ways for cost conscious travelers to save some colones especially those who are willing to forgo a degree of comfort As a general rule do as the Ticos do seeking out local restaurants accommodations and attractions Advertisement Here are top tips for traveling on a small budget in Costa Rica Daily costs Hostel room US Basic room for two US Eco lodge per night US Local intercity bus ticket US Tourist shuttle bus ticket US Casado fixed price meal US Batido fresh fruit smoothie US Craft beer US Admission to national park or nature preserve US Canopy tour US Average daily cost US Brave the green wet season The peak tourist season in Costa Rica runs from December to April Prices for flights and accommodation are cheaper outside this season For the biggest savings book your trips between August and November when prices are often cut in half Pack your rain gear Choose the right airport for your destination Should we say choose the right destination for your airport Costa Rica has two international airports the big one in San JosÃ SJO and a smaller convenient option in Liberia LIR Itâ s worth considering both as prices can vary considerably That said assuming youâ re not traveling around the entire country the best airport is almost always the one that is closest to your destination Getting around Costa Rica can be challenging so youâ ll save time and money and cut down on hassle by minimizing the amount of domestic travel you have to do Paying with cash will avoid hefty card fees Â Andrzej Rostek Getty Images Pay in cash or pay a fee Many hotels and tour operators charge an extra fee for customers who pay by credit card Others instead offer a discount for customers who pay in cash Either way the result is the same itâ s cheaper if you pay with cash in Costa Rica While the official currency is the Costa Rican bring a stash of US dollars or procure local colones from an ATM so you can pay in cash when it makes a difference and avoid this unnecessary expense Get on the bus Gustavo Renting a car in Costa Rica is more expensive than you think mandatory liability insurance jacks up prices â sometimes doubling the base price Traveling by bus offers a huge savings and it s also better for the environment Advertisement Public bus fares range from US to US depending on the distance traveled Keep in mind that different companies operate different routes often out of different stations which can be confusing Useful resources for figuring out scheduling include Visit Costa Rica the Bus Schedule and Yo Viajo As a step up from the public buses several companies run tourist shuttles between popular destinations These are more comfortable and more expensive than the public buses but they re usually still cheaper and better than renting a car Companies include EasyRide Tropical Tours Interbus and Monkey Ride The shuttles run on a set schedule and can be booked online Fares start around A wood cabin in Tortuguero village Â Invictus SARL Alamy Stock Photo Sleep in hostels or cabinas Traditionally budget lodging in Costa Rica comes in the form of cabinas which are usually rustic single room cabins with limited amenities Cabinas can vary significantly in terms of comfort and price but they are relatively affordable often servicing Tico families In addition to cabinas the more popular tourist destinations also have various hostel options which can range from very basic to rather swanky There is a new breed of hostel known as the â hostel resort â which offers their guests a variety of amenities such as a swimming pool entertainment center and workout facilities Their accommodation choices usually include traditional dorms as well as private rooms at various price points Order a casado to enjoy a tasty and budget friendly meal Â Juan Carlos fotografia br Getty Images Eat where the locals eat Even the smallest town or village has at least one soda a local restaurant serving traditional Tico fare Itâ s not fine dining by any means but itâ s tasty filling and inexpensive The best bargain on the menu is almost always a casado a set menu that includes rice veggies and a protein Shop at local markets and food stands Another way to fill your belly for less is to shop at local markets Feed body and soul with tropical fruits and farm fresh veggies Or sample the street food which includes some Costa Rican classics such as empanadas and tacos Ticos Donâ t be afraid to drink the tap water Tap water is safe to drink throughout Costa Rica with the exception of some extremely remote spots Thereâ s no reason to waste money on bottled water and contribute to plastic pollution In fact national parks donâ t even allow guests to bring single use plastics into protected areas If it makes you nervous to drink tap water invest in a water filter and use it Youâ ll save money and the planet in the long run Choose activities you can do independently Sometimes you need a tour guide to go ziplining waterfall rappelling or whitewater rafting for example and sometimes you donâ t Needless to say taking a tour is more expensive than going it alone so prioritize activities that don t require a tour or a guide Most national parks and nature preserves have well maintained trail systems that are designed for independent exploration You can snorkel off the beach in the Caribbean or the Pacific all you need is the gear And up and down the coast kayaks are available for rent even without a tour guide Take advantage of the fact that all Costa Rican beaches are free and open to the public Â Raymond Forbes LLC Stocksy United Discover the free local spots All beaches in Costa Rica are public which means they re open and free to all Many other free swimming spots are well known to locals if not to tourists With a little local research you can find swimming holes and waterfalls hiking trails and hot springs that you can enjoy usually with other locals In some cases it is advised or required to give a donation to the property owners a small price to pay â usually only a couple dollars â for an authentic local experience Some of my favorite spots include La Choyin a free hot spring in La Fortuna Cerro del Amigo the free hiking trail in Monteverde and El Miro a fabulous free scenic lookout in Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Costa Rica Let a local expert craft your
