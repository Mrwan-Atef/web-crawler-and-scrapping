A guide to Cairo s craft heritage following in the footsteps of ancient artisans Experience the city from a different perspective by stepping back and observing the craftsmanship of the people rather than bartering for their products Photograph by Slawek Kozdras TRAVEL A guide to Cairo s craft heritage following in the footsteps of ancient artisans The craft workshops of Cairo tell a story going back to the glory days of medieval Islamic art a side to the capital easy to overlook with the much delayed Grand Egyptian Museum opening on the horizon By James Stewart August min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK In Cairo the pull between culture and commerce is long established Five thousand years ago on the fertile banks of the Nile wealthy Ancient Egyptians commissioned artisans to adorn their tombs for the voyage into the afterlife crafting funerary pottery woodwork amulets and exquisite paintings Today souvenir stalls outside many of those same tombs and in the souks of the capital still offer designs that take inspiration from those ancient crafts passed down over the centuries and adapted to sell to visitors Shopping can be a rich and revealing complement to exploring the art and archaeology of Ancient Egypt In the camel coloured desert at Saqqara miles south of the city I circled Egypt s first pyramid and watched workmen dressed in flowing jellabiyas cart earth from a recently discovered tomb I saw wall carvings and paintings of crocodiles and Nile fishermen paddling reed boats like five millennia old film footage I stood in the subterranean tomb of pharaoh Unas its stone a blur of hieroglyphic incantations for eternal life its roof fretted with stars And now I find myself in the workshop of Saqqara s Oriental Carpet School It wasn t my idea is any phrase in Egypt more dispiriting than Now we ll visit a carpet factory But we were passing and my guide Maher Abu Elkhair promised it would be interesting As workers knot wool and silk threads on looms in one dextrous action a salesman rattles through the patter how Saqqara has a tradition of handmade carpets a craft which flourished in Egypt from the how children learn the vocation alongside fathers how a metre square is the work of a month I nod But I m not listening I ve just seen what s on one loom Master carpet maker Adem is weaving five point stars into a kilim They look naggingly familiar A beat later I realise why they re exactly the same as those at Unas s tomb Was this deliberate I ask Adem shrugs They asked me to make a carpet with stars I design with stars For one beautiful revelatory moment the threads of ancient and modern Egypt combine twisting into a perfect cultural knot Then the salesman says We have more upstairs if you want to buy Something for the memory Fustat Traditional Crafts Centre is in one of Cairo s oldest districts Photograph by Slawek Kozdras Later this year the much delayed Grand Egyptian Museum is set to open in Giza on Cairo s western outskirts It will house the largest collection of Egyptian antiquities ever assembled around objects Ancient Egypt s rock star pharaoh Tutankhamun gets two galleries to himself uniting all artefacts of his tomb for the first time since archaeologist Howard Carter gasped in wonder as he unsealed the door a century ago What King Tut s beaded sandals and gold amulets ultimately showcase is Egyptian craft It has fascinated Europeans since the Greeks and Romans imported Egyptian gold ivory and other luxury goods or Venice struck trade deals with medieval Mamluk sultans for glass and ceramics Later Victorian archaeologists gawped in souks Now it s my turn I ve come to winkle out Cairo s craft traditions It s shopping but with cultural credentials Fustat district doesn t look like much it fell into decline as the axis of the city moved north after the century But it holds some of Christianity s oldest churches still serving Egypt s Coptic community and the National Museum of Egyptian Civilisation opened here in showcasing the country s eras from the pharaohs to the present day It s here that Mamdouh Sakr manager of the Fustat Traditional Crafts Centre has nurtured crafts in a district once renowned for them For years as the country s first Islamic capital Fustat was a very vibrant city because of its Nile port he says The whole culture of Egypt was exported through here Excavations have found kilns glass and ceramics of exceptional quality The Vatican has more Fatimid era ceramics than Cairo Local artisans work on their projects at the traditional arts centre Photograph by Slawek Kozdras The crafts centre receives few callers this is Maher s first visit here despite decades of guiding but Mamdouh happily shows me around Women chat while painting lozenges like teardrops on jugs A man punches white clay into a mould then peels out a tile of beautiful interlocking stars Other moulds have webs of hexagons or lotus flowers all designs from historic Cairene mosques Because of Islamic traditions that avoided representing living creatures complex geometry was one art form that came without the risk of straying into idolatry Gamal Ahmed Shosha straddles a potter s wheel His mother was a potter and his grandmother and her mother I had no choice he says with a grin Imported white clay is tougher but soft red clay of Nile silt is better for pottery Look he says He presses a metal strip into a spinning bowl Ribbons of ochre clay spool to the floor The crude bowl refines into beauty The best stuff is in a gallery shop flawless marquetry boxes bead necklaces fit for queens intricate brass bowls gypsum panels like cobwebs and those tiles now blazing with colour and framed Such work once decorated the palaces of the elite It s part of Egyptian identity Mamdouh says These crafts are unique like songs and language and some of the designs are years old But if we don t support them it will all be Made in China The art of the pharaohs is as remote from modern Egypt as the works of ancient Britons are from us In the absence of a living tradition it s all too easy to give way to cheap knock offs We can t let that happen to Coptic and Islamic art says Mamdouh That s why the centre backed by the UK s Prince s Foundation hosts students a year mostly young women who train in the old crafts Into the souks Ask Cairo locals about crafts and they ll point you to Khan el Khalili souk in the old city It s an experience as much as a retail opportunity If the pyramids conceal their secrets here all is on show shisha pipes and silver telescopes and antique telephones jewels and junk You have the sense that whatever your desire it lies within these labyrinthine medieval alleys I want to do more than buy though I want to meet the makers On Al Moez Street amid some of the greatest architecture in medieval Islam Khaled Mohamed delicately hammers the goddess Isis onto a copper disk outside his shop Al Moez Silver Behind him hang plates their kaleidoscopic engraving seeming to whirl as you look The year old learned his trade aged from his father who learned from his father who learned from a Cairene artisan until you re back in a century golden age under the Mamluk sultans This doesn t require talent if you know the rules I m one percent the artist of my father Khaled says The secret is to love what you do Money problems since the Egyptian Revolution have closed his engraving school Yet Khaled s main problem is us Ninety percent of tourists think my plates are made in a factory They think I do this for show You can see why His work is pure precision The best time to visit Khan el Khalili souk is in the evening when the streets fill up with local people Photograph by Slawek Kozdras Al Moez Silver is just the first stop on my crafts treasure hunt through Khan el Khalili At the top of narrow stairs in Jordi Passage I find Achmed Mahmoud soldering gems into a bracelet in a no name workshop Bracelets frames rings silver amulets he ll hand produce whatever you want I have hundreds of designs he says with a wave at shelves of metal weights He slams one onto paper and its embossed image appears on the sheet a dove a template to be hacksawed and polished up within three hours Such is the skill of a year old who has worked since he was nine I switch to the adjacent Al Azhar quarter It s quieter more local Among Arabic pop songs jingling from cafes and women with hillocks of flatbread I stumble upon shoebox workrooms I m sure I ll never find again I meet Bahan and Hesham gluing minute mother of pearl triangles onto wooden boxes It s easy to dismiss such souvenir favourites until you learn their traditional history as boxes for dowries or that mother of pearl inlay was an Ancient Egyptian trick to prettify poor wood Behind Al Azhar mosque Mohamed Mimi Amin shows me years worth of expertise casually lying around his workshop here a beautiful star lantern for Ramadan and a heart shaped amulet with turquoise to prevent jealousy there a lamp with kissing peacocks within a thicket of brass That design came from an early Coptic chandelier I m not rich but these designs are my capital They re historic They have proven their beauty he says Mohamed Mimi Amin helps keep the craft tradition alive in Al Azhar district fixing traditional lanterns Photograph by Slawek Kozdras There s a problem though Mimi says foreign visitors expect bargains in Egypt Few stump up for skilled work so shopkeepers prefer factory made tat That s bad news for Mimi and for his young son smiling shyly from a workbench I recall how Bahan said cheap boxes used plastic inlay instead of mother of pearl Also how Achmed had advised his son to seek another profession after five years training He moved into computers instead Mimi glances around his workshop at hand drills and hacksaws and off cuts of brass We have no machine here yet alhamdulillah praise be to God The Grand Egyptian Museum arrives freighted with huge aspirations There s big talk about how it can make Egypt proud again I m sure it will But I also wonder whether our fascination with the dead history of the pharaohs blinds us to a living one Whether we shouldn t be just as fascinated by people like Mimi quietly continuing the craft of centuries in the backstreets of Cairo How to do it Steppes Travel
