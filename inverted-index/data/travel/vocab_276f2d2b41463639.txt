of bubbles Amazing stay cosseted by their remarkable service We stayed for nights in November with family booked two of their standard rooms We have stayed at most of the Taj palaces properties before and we always have very high expectations from Taj specially for their palace properties I am very happy to say that we were not disappointed and had a really memorable stay The property itself was very impressive being one of the main residences of the Maharaja of Jaipur in the past It has a huge area with lots of greenery and crazy number of peacocks which live breed on the property The palace built structure itself was too overly big and you can easily walk the perimeter of the palace in mins On their grounds they do have a spa indoor pool and multiple restaurants Some of the key highlights for our stay were Even though we booked standard rooms they were of really good size with balcony facing the gardens where you could hear the peacocks in the morning and super comfortable beds Luxury amenities from Kama Ayurveda as expected What always sets Taj apart from other experiences is their hospitality You would expect this charm to fade over time but somehow Taj has maintained it This is where you feel genuine and not forced care by Taj staff members during your stay We were celebrating my father s birthday and the staff was very kind to put together a small celebration at a private location space within the hotel with flower decorations flower rangoli personalized pictures cake and even their very renowned in house flute player serenading us with some music to mark this special occasion We are very grateful to Taj and people like Amisha Anjali Fazal Irshad Anil and Madan who put all of this together for us There were so many activities most of them complementary to hotel guests which you or your kids family could do at this property that you need one whole day to experience what they have to offer to be honest From the horse carriage ride showing the palace grounds vintage car ride showing the palace grounds peacock feeding to pizza making activity for kids to the cultural program regional dance music show they have every evening there were so many things all of which were very well managed and executed Food was good especially Suvarna Mahal meal which was exquisite We also had food at their Verandah cafe which was great as well One minor improvement area was their breakfast buffet Now by normal standards it was great and there were no issues But for example we just stayed at the Hyatt Regency Mansarovar for a night before this property and their breakfast buffet was much better in terms of choices and spread so we always expect a but more from Taj and our only feedback to them would be improve their breakfast buffet offering this becomes specially glaring for guests who are staying multiple nights at the property We would love to return again and highly recommend this property to anyone who wants to experience a slice of living like royalty Thanks Taj for continuing to maintain your impossible hospitality standards Read more Date of stay November of bubbles Value of bubbles Rooms of bubbles Location of
