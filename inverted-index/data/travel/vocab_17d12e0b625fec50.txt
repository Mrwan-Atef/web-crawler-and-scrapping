things to know before you visit Panama City in Richard Arghiris Mar min read Share Get prepared for your visit to Panama City with our guide to what you need to know before you go Â Westend Getty Images Panama s capital is a cosmopolitan cityscape with a skyline dominated by gleaming skyscrapers and streets full of culture incredible food and enticing attractions Explore on foot and take a stroll along the bay while the Pacific breeze keeps you cool before exploring Panama City s different neighborhoods and finding its colonial history etched on every street Tourist crime here is low and most are of the low key opportunistic type you ll encounter in any major city Keep your wits about you avoid the more rough and tumble parts of town and you ll be just fine From planning your trip to local etiquette hereâ s what you need to know before traveling to Panama City Where you stay depends on your budget and needs Every neighborhood has its advantages and disadvantages With cobblestone streets and Spanish colonial architecture the historic quarter of Casco Viejo is the most memorable and romantic part of the city Advertisement It has lots of high end restaurants luxury lofts and swanky rooftop bars but a dearth of budget friendly places to eat and its public transport links arenâ t the best The Calidonia district in the southern part of the city occupies a grid of streets from Plaza de Mayo to Calle Este Avenida Central bustles with market stalls and the roads to the south are dotted with budget friendly hotels The district is also near plenty of Metro trains and buses You can pick up cheap street food during the day when kitchens open for local hospital staff and civil servants After dark however Calidonia becomes shady and downbeat with limited dining options To the east of Calidonia the so called banking district is a patchwork of several districts or corregimientos including modern and emerging neighborhoods that host the lionâ s share of high end lodgings and Airbnb rentals There are a few hostels and not nearly enough economical hotels Many decent restaurants are dispersed throughout the banking district but are not always within walking distance If youâ re in town to party the Marbella and Bella Vista neighborhoods have great access to the bars and clubs on Calle Uruguay El Cangrejo is an entertainment zone with a casino good Metro train links on VÃ a EspaÃ a and a parade of restaurants on VÃ a Argentina Carnival is a vibrant fun time in Panama City but unfortunately prices are at their peak Â Rainer Lesniewski Shutterstock Time your visit for budget friendly deals and great weather The high season coincides with the dry season â mid December to early April â when prices are generally higher The major festivals of Christmas New Year Carnival and Semana Santa see a price increase in the capital but not as much as the beaches where most city dwellers spend the holidays Mid April to early December is the cheapest time to visit Panama City as long as you donâ t mind getting soaked by the rain Most deluges last only an hour or two in the afternoon but the season gets wetter as it goes on In the depths of it the skies can be overcast for days but the rains are usually intermittent and the cloud cover can bring relief from the relentless Panamanian sun You re better off with a Metro card than a car Although a car is good for day trips out of town donâ t plan on driving much in the city The one way road system is baffling city thoroughfares are often congested and diversions are par for the course Instead use Panama Cityâ s public transport system which includes a fleet of air conditioned buses and Central Americaâ s first ever Metro train Buy a three in one â RapiPassâ upon arrival and gain access to Metro trains and buses and the departure gates at Albrook bus station Always keep a stash of low denomination bills You ll need to show your ID and sign a register if you pay for anything with a higher bill than US Counterfeit money is an issue in the country so all and bills will be scrutinized in Panama Advertisement Donâ t smoke in public Legislation introduced in banned smoking in public places People who smoke in non designated areas are subject to fines of Pack a few outfits you re proud of for socializing and evenings out Â Jeremy Poland Getty Images Dress for comfort but look sharp Panamanians like to dress up and look their best The ostentatious displays of fashion on display in Obarrio include stiletto heels that somehow survive the assault course of the cityâ s pavements When socializing casual attire is fine but avoid wearing shorts and sandals to nice restaurants or social functions Tip hotel cleaning staff If you stay in a hotel leave a tip for the person who cleans your room â US a day is fine A tip is often added in good restaurants but not always â check the bill before paying In low key local eateries you may leave some loose change for the server Unless they help with luggage taxi drivers donâ t expect a tip Donâ t use drugs Although Panama City is steeped in narco dollars Panamanian society frowns on drug use and the law does not tolerate it If the police find you in possession of even small quantities of marijuana you could spend several years in a Panamanian prison Donâ t expect people to speak English Panama City Spanish is Caribbean Spanish â extremely fast and heavily laden with jerga slang If Spanish is not your first language you may struggle to catch it Donâ t expect to find many English speakers during your day to day transactions English is widely spoken in the business community but not much outside of it and mastering a few basic Spanish phrases will help you get around It s safe to drink tap water The tap water in Panama City is perfectly safe to drink Save on plastic waste by refilling water bottles at a faucet If you prefer purified water you can refill at the liter garrafones in most hotel lobbies Remember that the city is on the edge of the jungle and it can take time to acclimatize Â DavorLovincic iStockphoto Getty Images Prepare for environmental hazards Panama City is an urban hothouse scratched out of the jungle The elements are fierce â humidity is often You should take a day or two to relax and acclimate to the heat if you come from a cold weather country Always apply sunscreen before going outside and keep an adequate water supply handy Wear light clothes and a hat to keep the sun off your face Bring a sturdy umbrella if you visit during the wet season Panama City suffers from flash floods during heavy downpours If you get caught in a storm you could end up wading through deep puddles Traffic is generally heavy and many parts of the city are not pedestrian friendly People living with asthma may find their symptoms are aggravated by fumes Sadly the Bay of Panama is a dump for industrial effluence and untreated sewage so the oceanfront sometimes reeks Be aware of common scams Scammers operate in all big cities and some target tourists Be wary of strangers who tell unfortunate and earnest stories that end with them asking for money If it seems suspicious it probably is Watch out for fake tour guides who ask for payment in advance and then stand you up Old school taxi scams that involve going around the houses to increase the fare can happen anywhere in the world but in Panama City itâ s common for taxis to simply overcharge There are no meters in the cabs Fares are supposed to be based on zones but in practice they rarely are If you look foreign taxi drivers will bump up the fare It s best to negotiate and agree on the price beforehand Panama City is a relatively safe place for women to visit solo Â Chrispictures Shutterstock Solo women travelers may receive unwanted attention Panama City is typically safe for solo women travelers but it s best to avoid walking alone at night in Casco Viejo Santa Ana or Calidonia Women may receive attention from chatty men on Metro trains or buses If a man wonâ t leave you alone ask a nearby older woman to assist Steer clear of sketchy neighborhoods Thirty years ago Casco Viejo was dicey Today things have somewhat improved but there are still pockets of the old neighborhood where you should exercise caution If youâ re staying in Casco Viejo the minute walk from the nearest Metro train station de Mayo is risky at night Use a taxi or an Uber instead To the west of Casco Viejo the neighboring El Chorrillo district is very dangerous and neglected You should avoid this neighborhood entirely The district of Santa Ana north of Casco Viejo is bisected by the pedestrianized peatonal a lively shopping street that is safe to walk during the day stay alert in the crowds The side roads east of the peatonal are sketchy and you shouldnâ t wander around them At its north end the peatonal connects with Plaza de Mayo the National Assembly a Metro station a bus terminal and a grimy confluence of roads and flyovers The area is lively into the evening but stay alert and use a vehicle after North of de Mayo Avenida Central strikes into Calidonia district with street vendors and hustle It s fine to explore in the day but donâ t flaunt expensive equipment or jewelry Calidonia is spooky and seedy after dark Avoid run down or poorly lit streets Keep your documents handy Everyone is legally required to carry a photo ID at all times in public in Panama Tourists should carry their passport or a photocopy of their passport with the photo page and immigration entry stamp LGBTIQ travelers are welcome Attitudes in rural Panama are somewhat conservative but less so in Panama City LGBTIQ travelers are unlikely to encounter prejudice and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity is prohibited by Panamanian law Thereâ s a lively gay scene in Casco Viejo and El Cangrejo Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Panama
