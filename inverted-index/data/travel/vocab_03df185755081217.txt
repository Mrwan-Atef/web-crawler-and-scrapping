min read Share The Hump Ridge Track is New Zealand s newest Great Walk Â Jessica Wynne Lockhart Lonely Planet I started my morning along a wide swath of sandy beach nary another soul in sight before climbing high into the mountains through goblin like forests Around me everything was a million shades of green save for the occasional burst of color electric blue mushrooms neon orange lichen and the red underside of a kÄ kÄ â s wings as it swooped down low beside my head Finally emerging above the treeline I was rewarded with degree views of one of New Zealand â s most remote and jaw droppingly beautiful corners Fiordland National Park I was trialing the mile Hump Ridge Track which became New Zealandâ s newest Great Walk in October â only the second to be added to the renowned hiking collection in about years New Zealandâ s Great Walks are considered the countryâ s most iconic multiday treks but hiking one is harder than just showing up It takes planning with bookings on the most popular routes selling out within minutes In the bookings system crashed when people logged on at the same time most vying for a spot on the mile Milford Track Advertisement Thatâ s not to say itâ s impossible If youâ re planning a trip to New Zealand hereâ s everything you need to know about the Great Walks including the new Hump Ridge Track and the perennially popular Milford Track The Tongariro Alpine Crossing is part of the much longer Tongariro Northern Circuit Great Walk Â Peng Shi What are New Zealand s Great Walks Managed by the Department of Conservation DOC the Great Walks are a collection of multiday hikes called â trampsâ in Kiwi that showcase the diversity of New Zealandâ s landscape from volcanic plateaus to golden hued beaches Theyâ re also amongst the most accessible backcountry experiences in Aotearoa the MÄ ori language name for New Zealand Trails are easy to follow with hikers staying in huts â staffed by wardens and equipped with shared bunk rooms kitchens and outhouses â along the way although camping is also an option on some of the trails Their popularity length and difficulty vary with most lasting for between three and five days Strangely some arenâ t even walks at all The Whanganui Journey in the central North Island is a canoe trip Meanwhile mountain biking is permitted on the West Coast â s Paparoa Track and Kahurangi National Parkâ s Heaphy Track Bookings for the Lake Waikaremoana Track open on May Â Karin Wassmer Shutterstock How can I book a Great Walk The process for scoring a spot isnâ t unlike trying to get Taylor Swift tickets You need to be prepared and it helps to have more than one member of your party on the case The first step is to sign up for a DOC account and set up your profile Then mark your calendar for the booking day In bookings will open for the Great Walk Season which runs from roughly October to April on the following dates May at NZST Heaphy Track Kepler Track Rakiura Track May at NZST Whanganui Journey Routeburn Track Tongariro Northern Circuit May at NZST Lake Waikaremoana Track Abel Tasman Coast Track Paparoa Track May at NZST Milford Track On the day bookings open for your walk of choice be logged in and ready Youâ ll need to have a form of payment and know the names ages and country of residence for each hiker in your group There is one exception to this rule which is the Hump Ridge Track Bookings can be made directly on the walkâ s dedicated website up to two years in advance Mountain biking is permitted on the Paparoa Track and the Heaphy Track Â dchadwick Getty Images Are there any insider secrets to scoring a Great Walk spot Being flexible on when you want to travel helps but there are a few other tricks to nabbing a spot Advertisement First choose your dates carefully Kiwis love tramping so bookings during the summer school holiday period â which runs from late December until early February â are amongst the most sought after For the best weather and availability try early December or March instead Counterintuitively it can also be better to try booking a couple of hours after DOCâ s system opens In order to ensure their spot multiple people in the same hiking party will often make a booking for their entire group That means theyâ ll have to go back later â often that same day â to cancel one of the duplicate bookings Spots can also open up later in the season even on the coveted Milford Track Members of the very active Tramping in New Zealand Facebook group will post if they cancel a booking alerting other members to available dates in the system Finally if your budget allows you can choose to forgo the booking day frenzy altogether Tour operators such as Ultimate Hikes offer guided Great Walks experiences on the Milford and Routeburn Tracks with packages that include accommodation at private lodges meals transfers and the use of a backpack Youâ ll pay for the ease of booking though Ultimate Hikes charges upwards of NZD while independent international hikers on the same tracks will pay less than NZD for huts and transfers Fees are even lower for New Zealand residents The Milford Track is one of the hardest Great Walks to book a place on Â ï Getty Images Whatâ s the new Hump Ridge Track like And is the Milford Track really worth the hype Weâ re glad you asked Both tracks go through the wilds of Fiordland National Park so itâ s hard not to draw comparisons However the two are markedly different experiences The Milford Trackâ s title of the â finest walk in the worldâ is entirely justified Stunningly beautiful in its wild isolation it carries hikers through valleys and over mountain passes where hundreds of waterfalls cascade off the surrounding rock faces on a rainy day Hikers arrive on their fourth day into Milford Sound Piopiotahi a fiord of towering peaks that attracts up to a million visitors annually But itâ s also the hardest track to get a booking on So if you have your heart set on exploring Fiordland the community owned Hump Ridge Track is a great alternative Itâ s set in a subalpine environment favored by kÄ kÄ and kea endemic parrots With epic ocean views â including of Stewart Island Rakiura â boardwalks trace the ridgelines before descending into forests that drip in moss Other highlights include walking across the longest viaduct in the southern hemisphere and the opportunity to swim with wild Hectorâ s dolphins at Port Craig a ghost town where youâ ll spend your second night There are also some splash out worthy upgrades on offer weâ re talking private rooms with real beds hot showers flush toilets and even the option to get your pack helicoptered up to the first hut The Queen Charlotte Track is an excellent alternative to an official Great Walk Â ChrisNoe Shutterstock I didnâ t get a Great Walk booking What are some alternative hikes If youâ ve missed out on booking a Great Walk this year there are two other beginner friendly ways to experience New Zealandâ s backcountry Try a Great Walk day hike instead With the help of local tour operators and transfer services itâ s possible to experience a short portion of a Great Walk with the added benefit that you wonâ t have to schlep your stuff For example the Tongariro Alpine Crossing â arguably the countryâ s best single day hike â is part of the much longer Tongariro Northern Circuit Or for one of the most scenic sections of the Whanganui Journey take a jet boat from Pipiriki to the Bridge to Nowhere then paddle back to your starting point For walks in Fiordland family owned tour operator Trips Tramps offers a walking package that allows you to get a taste of the Kepler Routeburn and Milford Tracks over the course of three consecutive days Choose a different multi day walk There are hundreds of great hikes to do across New Zealand even if theyâ re not â greatâ with a capital â G â Some of our favorites include the Coromandel â s two day Kauaeranga Kauri Trail the Marlborough Soundsâ Queen Charlotte Track which nearly became a Great Walk in and the more challenging Cape Brett Track in Northland When can I hike New Zealandâ s Great Walks The official â Great Walks Seasonâ lasts for the southern hemisphere summer months of October through to April It is possible to access some of the Great Walks outside of this season but only if youâ re well equipped and have extensive backcountry experience The weather conditions from May to September can be harsh and may include flooding freezing temperatures heavy snowfalls and high winds Huts arenâ t staffed or serviced during this time period and bridges may be removed from river crossings What do I need to pack for a Great Walk Huts along the Great Walks have shared bunk rooms bring earplugs equipped with sleeping mats outhouses and kitchens with gas stoves and running water In addition to suitable footwear and clothing â which includes wet weather gear for notoriously high rainfall areas like the Milford Track â youâ ll need to carry a sleeping bag crockery and all your food for the duration of your adventure Fortunately outfitters at towns and cities near the trailheads make it easy to source and rent any gear you might need on arrival in New Zealand Many also offer transfer services to and from trailheads For comprehensive information about each Great Walk â including region specific
