motorbike adventures to tips on hiring a car and driver here are the best road trips in India Solovyova Getty Images Whether you ve chartered a car and driver or hired your own motorcycle to venture out alone rumbling across the varied roads and terrains of India is an unforgettable way to experience this sensational country The simple act of traveling from A to B will immerse you in the sights and sounds of the worldâ s most colorful country Though there are lots of options for traveling by bus and train choosing a road trip gives you control over your itinerary and the freedom to stop where and when you want to explore further The good news is that you donâ t need to brave the traffic yourself â itâ s easy to hire a car or with a driver almost everywhere in India meaning you can concentrate on the scenery while your driver deals with the sometimes challenging road conditions If you prefer to take the driving seat renting a motorcycle is a wonderful way to explore the subcontinent particularly if you stick to the backroads Self drive car rental is harder to arrange but some adventurous souls travel around India with their own vehicles â a few hardy travelers have even navigated India in a modified autorickshaw Grab your sense of adventure and get ready to hit the road with our pick of the best road trips in India Advertisement Experience the best of the Golden Triangle on a road trip Christophe Boisvieux Getty Images Indiaâ s Golden Triangle Best road trip for Mughal monuments Delhiâ Delhi miles allow five days Short and sweet the loop from Delhi to Agra and Jaipur packs a lot of wonders into a few days of driving Your adventure begins in Delhi where the ruins of eight cities tell the story of Indiaâ s great Islamic empires Hit the city s highlights including Red Fort Humayunâ s Tomb the Jama Masjid and the bazaars of Chandni Chowk which have changed only superficially since Mughal emperor Shah Jahanâ s time With a chartered vehicle or rented motorcycle itâ s easy to swing by the sacred cities of Mathura and Vrindavan where Krishna frolicked with milkmaids in the Hindu epics After these peaceful stops steel yourself for a mix of the stressful and sublime in Agra where the glorious Taj Mahal more than lives up to its reputation Find more Mughal magnificence at nearby Fatehpur Sikri the red sandstone city founded and later abandoned by emperor Akbar the Great Once you follow the to Jaipur youâ ll share every fort palace and mystical observatory with a crowd so consider making the odd detour before you hit the Pink Cityâ s palaces and bazaars Detour Before zooming west from Fatehpur Sikri to Jaipur consider a detour south to Gwalior whose beautiful fort is less mobbed than other stops on this circuit Before you complete the third side of the triangle tack on one more detour to spot tigers stalking ruined battlements in Ranthambhore National Park before diving back into urban life Manali to Ladakh across the Himalaya Best road trip for silence and serenity Manaliâ Srinagar miles allow ten days Many people follow the mountain circuit from Manali to Ladakh and on to Kashmir in a chartered but we strongly recommend renting an Enfield Bullet motorcycle This allows you the life affirming thrill of pulling over by the roadside to find yourself alone in the silence of the high altitude Himalayan deserts From the hippie hill resort of Manali itâ s a two day slog over the Rohtang La to Leh through a landscape plucked straight from the heyday of the Silk Road Thereâ s little vegetation and even less shade and the cold and altitude will hit you like a sledgehammer Recuperate with trips to Buddhist monasteries and yoga classes in Leh then hit the road again for a different take on the Himalayas in Kashmir The highway west to Srinagar weaves between ancient villages but as the hills turn from dust yellow to lush green the culture shifts from Buddhism to Islam before the minarets of Srinagar loom into view The Kashmir valley is sometimes troubled but when itâ s calm the experience of watching Dal Lake appearing slowly through the morning mist from the deck of a houseboat is simply sublime Planning tip Whether you drive yourself or let someone else take the wheel it s imperative to respect the mountain climate Snow closes the high passes into Ladakh in winter and road travel is usually only possible from June to late September or early October You ll share the road with camel carts in Rajasthan s desert Dchauy Shutterstock Rajasthanâ s colored cities Best road trip for desert colors

Amber Follow to the Jain and Muslim pilgrimage center of Ajmer and duck west to reach the famous Pushkar with its temple circled lake and legendary camel fair in October or November Return to the for the rumbling ride to Udaipur the white city â draped like a silk scarf on the shores of tranquil Lake Pichola Dose up on ice white palaces then deviate west to the temple strewn hill station of Mt Abu Veering north to Jodhpur youâ ll immediately spot the lapis colored buildings that earned the Blue City its name Get another blast of military might at Mehrangarh Fort then drive west through serious desert country to the sand yellow city of Jaisalmer whose fortified walls look almost carved from the desert itself Close off the loop via Bikaner where youâ ll leave the tourist crowds behind before diving back into the thick of things in Jaipur Detour Having your own transport opens up the opportunity to get off the tourist track in this heavily visited state Consider tacking on a side trip north from Jaipur to Shekhawati famed for its mural filled haveli mansions Advertisement A Hanuman temple at sunrise in Hampi Dmytro Gilitukha Shutterstock Hampi and the Hoysalas Best road trip for

town part beach retreat Kolkata to Darjeeling Best road trip for Himalayan views and side treks Kolkataâ Yuksom miles allow eight days The east of India is often overlooked by the crowds who surge north from Delhi but the journey through West Bengal to the foothills of Mt Khangchendzonga has an epic sense of mission Start in crowded but cultured Kolkata visiting ashrams temples and striking civic buildings reclaimed from British colonialism Fit in a tour of the tiger stalked swamps of the Sunderbans before you head for the hills The journey north takes you past little visited country towns to intriguing Shantiniketan a university town with a long history of dance theater and poetry From here youâ ll break north to reach the emerald green tea estates and delightfully dated grand hotels of Darjeeling where youâ ll likely catch your first up close views of the Himalayas To get intimate with the snow peaks walk the Singalila Ridge trekking route or edge even closer to Mt Khangchendzonga by picking up a permit to enter lofty Sikkim A route through Kalimpong Gangtok and Pelling will reveal views that would make mountaineers itch for their ice axes To cap it all off you can get within touching distance of the snow on the trek to the Goecha La from Yuksom Planning tip Youâ ll need a Restricted Areas Permit to enter Sikkim but this is easily obtained in Kolkata

Indiaâ s southern hill stations Grab a cuppa amidst swirling tea estates in Munnar South Indiaâ s top tea growing center before you return to the coast Planning tip The monsoon obscures the views from

and driver in India Youâ ll find drivers for hire offering their services at taxi and stands all over India or you can make arrangements through hotels and travel agencies Check that the driver speaks enough English to understand where you want to go and where you want to stop and confirm that the driver is able to cross state lines â some vehicles are only licensed to operate in certain areas Youâ ll need to agree on a price for the trip before you start and the cost should include fuel accommodation and food for the driver for multi day trips Prices start at around US per day rising for vehicles Be clear with your driver about what you want from your journey if you want to avoid stops at tourist shops and commission paying venues make this clear from the outset Exploring India by motorcycle or bike is for experienced riders Indiaâ s roads are not for fair weather motorcyclists but if you have a few miles under your belt and fancy a challenge itâ s a fabulous way to explore this enormous country Veteran hire companies such as Lalli Singh Tours in Delhi have sent hundreds of travelers off on journeys across India from the steamy southern jungles to the high passes of the Himalayas The best advice we can give is to ride slowly and defensively always give way to larger vehicles and carry a full repair kit and spares â and know how to use them The nostalgic British designed Enfield Bullet is the vehicle of choice for many travelers but itâ s a heavy brute newer machines from the likes of Bajaj are lighter and easier to handle If you plan to pedal your way around India by bicycle carry plenty of puncture repair kits and bring lights and high visibility gear If you donâ t want to transport your own bike into the country consider flying into Delhi and buying a bike at the Jhandewalan Cycle Market Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real India Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers Everywhere
