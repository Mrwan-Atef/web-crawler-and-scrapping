religious sites in Lumbini with our guide for first time visitors Alexandra Lande Shutterstock The birthplace of Prince Siddhartha Gautama who the world came to know as the Buddha Lumbini is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that houses several monuments of Buddhist and historical significance Despite being a while away from Nepal â s popular Kathmandu Pokhara Chitwan golden triangle Lumbini draws people â primarily pilgrims â to walk in the footsteps of its most famous resident from over years ago The km sq sq mile region is divided into three major territories â the Sacred Garden the Monastic Zone and the Cultural Centre and New Lumbini village Among other structures and sites it contains remains of viharas â monastic living quarters â and stupas and newer contemporary monasteries built by countries around the world to pay homage to the Buddha Advertisement As you walk among orange and maroon robed monks and past prayer flags here s everything you need to know about this spiritual site The summer months of May and June can be quite hot in Lumbini Shutterstock When should I go to Lumbini The best time to visit Lumbini is between October and December right after monsoon and before it gets too cold The monsoons are avoidable with constant rain that hinders movement as do the deep winters of January and February â the winter fog can keep landmarks covered for a good part of the day March and April are pleasant but Lumbini is only at an elevation of so unlike in Nepalâ s mountain destinations the summer months of May and June frequently hit C F However if you have it in you to brave the sultry weather it is worth going there in May or April depending on the Hindu calendar to see the Buddha Jayanti festivities that mark the Buddhaâ s day of birth How much time should I spend in Lumbini For a traveler headed to Lumbini with the intent of ticking it off their bucket list a dayâ s visit is enough to cover its major landmarks However a two day stop is the bare minimum for anyone who wants a more wholesome experience To get under the skin of not just the monuments but also Buddhism and its basic tenets add a third day to explore surrounding areas and absorb the atmosphere to understand why the faith echoes with many people around the world including those who define themselves as â spiritual but not religiousâ For those who want to pursue the complete Gautam Buddha circuit and explore the surrounding districts of Lumbini that comprise the Greater Lumbini area a week is recommended Is it easy to get in and around Lumbini The closest airport for Lumbini is Bhairahawa in Siddharth Nagar better known now as the Gautam Buddha International Airport Itâ s about miles away from Lumbini Garden the core complex and can be reached conveniently by taxi in half an hour There are buses all the way from Kathmandu too but poor road conditions can make the hour journey exasperating Due to its proximity with India many cross the border near here including backpackers traveling through Varanasi who make Lumbini their starting point for exploring Nepal The best way to cross the border from India is by train to Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh then bus to the border town of Sunauli Cross over into Nepal by foot or take a rickshaw if you donâ t want to navigate the crowds and hop on a bus to Lumbini miles away Advertisement Within Lumbini Garden move around on bicycles Go to the Tourist Information Centre for an overview of the site and start from the entrance at Gate no Alternatively sign up for the increasingly popular e rickshaw tours Top things to do in destination Walk around the Sacred Garden For nearly everyone who visits Lumbini the Sacred Garden believed to be the space within Lumbini where the Buddha was born tops the list This is spread around the Maya Devi temple named after his mother the queen who stopped here on her travels to birth the prince who would renounce his kingdom Just outside the Maya Devi temple stands the third century Ashoka Pillar that testifies the birth of the Buddha in BCE via an inscription on it It was commissioned by Mauryan emperor Ashoka the Great to commemorate his visit nearly years after the Buddhaâ s birth after he became an ardent follower of Buddhism Cycle around Lumbiniâ s lanes The best way to explore Lumbini is on a bicycle It allows you the freedom to set your own pace admire sites at leisure and break your journey as you please Take your time and soak in the placidity of the place The World Peace Pagoda houses statues of the Buddha Getty Images Climb up the World Peace Pagoda Among the more recent structures of the Monastic Zone the World Peace Pagoda built by Japan dominates the skyline with its gleaming white dome Walk up its steps to get an overview of the surroundings and go inside to see the Buddhaâ s statues in all his famous postures Ask those existential questions Itâ s not uncommon to approach a monk who will be happy to answer your questions on life Buddhist philosophy and his own life beyond Buddhism Better still prebook a personalized tour through Rural Heritage with a Buddhist scholar to walk around Lumbini or beyond for a deeper historical insight The Central Canal links the Eternal Flame with the Sacred Garden krishnagalami Shutterstock Boat down the Central Canal A unique way of seeing Lumbini is by floating through it on a boat down the central canal to the Eternal Flame that has been burning there since You can do a round trip or go one way with boats present on either end of the long mile canal that connects the Sacred Garden in the south and the World Peace Pagoda in the north Go beyond Lumbini While Lumbini garden is the birthplace of the Buddha other nearby places played a notable role in his life and are of equal historical importance Devadaha the hometown of Gautam Buddhaâ s mother Queen Maya is miles away and has monuments built in her honor Tilaurakot the paternal home where little Siddhartha grew up is another historical site with remains of a walled city Nyigrodharama now known as Kudan is miles further away from Tilaurakot It is where Buddhaâ s son Rahul was also ordained as a monk at the tender age of eight Archaeological work has revealed evidence of this history which can be explored in a day trip from Lumbini My favorite thing to do in destination Rows of small shops and informal cafes skirt the main Lumbini complex filled with travelers curious about Buddhism and friendly monks breaking for some tea My absolute favorite thing is to cycle past these rows soaking in the scenery occasionally stopping to join in a conversation on divinity with the contemporary seeker In between sips of tea and nodding my head in agreement over the flexible nature of Buddhism and alternating it with a rebuttal over the absolutes of religion I always end up making a new set of friends both Nepali and from around the world It is considered respectful to wear clothes that cover arms and legs when visiting monasteries AnilD Shutterstock What should I wear in Lumbini There is no dress code at the site but covering up is considered respectful in monasteries Expect to remove your shoes before entering the Maya Devi temple How much money do I need for Lumbini NPR For travelers from most countries Nepal is considered a value for money destination including in Lumbini Budget guesthouse Rs US Hotel for two Rs US Entrance for non SAARC foreign nationals Rs US Bicycle rental for the full day from Gate no Rs US E rickshaw tour Rs US per hour it takes about hours to cover the main sights Round
