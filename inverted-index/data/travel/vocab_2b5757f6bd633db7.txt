surprising watery adventures in the desert Claudia Laroye Mar min read Share Epic desert landscapes hospitable people and ancient ruins are Jordanâ s most obvious drawcards but a closer look reveals that despite its arid environment the kingdom is also wonderfully rich in lush oases from a biblical river to saline soaks and secret canyon pools Here are eight places to dive deeper into the life aquatic of Jordan Take a dip in the Dead Sea s hypersaline waters Â Reynold Mainse Design Pics Getty Images Float at earthâ s lowest point in the Dead Sea More than below sea level the landlocked Dead Sea is the lowest point on earth and the sea bed goes down even further in some places to a depth of Not that youâ ll be diving to the bottom with a salt content of the hypersalinity of Dead Sea waters means that youâ ll bob straight back up and going underwater will cause serious eye pain Instead just lean back relax and float gently on the surface with newspaper or book in hand Be sure to slather yourself in the Dead Seaâ s rich mineral mud which you can scoop up below your feet and then rinse off with a dip or freshwater shower Advertisement Feel the desert warmth in the water at Ma in Hot Springs Â ostill Shutterstock Soak in the oasis of Maâ in Hot Springs As you descend the winding roadway below reddish brown desert mountain cliffs the air becomes cooler and lush palm trees rise from the green valley floor This is not a mirage but rather the welcome sight of a true oasis Maâ in Hot Springs Supposedly a favourite bathing spot of King Herod in biblical times the gently flowing waterfalls and natural thermal mineral springs remain just as popular with century visitors The waterfalls originate from winter rains in Jordan s highland plains and reach temperatures above C The nearby Maâ in Hot Springs Hotel and Spa is a restful and restorative resort that capitalises on its prime location in the oasis You can book a relaxing spa treatment to access the private hot spring pool or spend time with day tripping locals in the public baths Jordan s short stretch of Red Sea Coast is a prime spot for snorkelling and diving Â Shahar Shabtai Shutterstock Underwater adventures at Jordanâ s Red Sea coast Snorkelling enthusiasts will delight in the Red Seaâ s aquatic playground filled with moray eels clownfish darting in and out of anemones and colourful tropical fish swimming among well preserved reefs along Jordanâ s long coastline One of the best places to explore the world under the sea is Aqaba Marine Park a protected reef area on the eastern shore accessible by boat from the port of Aqaba or by the Beach Highway The C waters clear visibility and abundant sea life make for ideal snorkelling conditions year round though it can get very hot on land in the summer months Advertisement Admire the Nabataeans handiwork in Petra s Siq Â Balint Kasza Explore the ancient aqueducts of Petra In addition to being excellent traders the Nabataeans of Petra were incredible hydrology engineers Their ingenuity in managing local water systems helped establish valuable oases and ensure their economic control of the ancient incense trading route linking Arabia to Europe and Africa This knowledge enabled them to survive and thrive in the rose city of Petra a fair distance from flowing rivers and the water source at Wadi Musa eight kilometres from the city You can still see evidence of Nabataean ingenuity as you stroll through the Siq the narrow gorge entrance into Petra dams to hold back flash flood waters terraces channels settling basins aqueducts rainwater harvesting springs and cisterns The water channels and aqueducts carved into the rocks along the Siq moved water into the heart of Petra providing fresh water to residents of this otherwise dry land on a daily basis Slide into Wadi Al Hidan in Madaba The rise of adventure tourism in Jordan is putting the spotlight on local favourites like Wadi Al Hidan in Madaba This naturally occurring black basalt gorge has become popular with thrill seeking hikers and canyoning enthusiasts and is even part of the newly opened Jordan Trail Three waterfalls one of which serves as a natural water slide feed cool swimming pools at the bottom of the narrow canyon You may need to book a visit ahead of time as daily visits have been capped to ensure the protection of this sensitive environment Visit the site where Jesus is thought to have been baptised at the Jordan River Â Anton Petrus Getty Images Retrace biblical footsteps along the Jordan River The Jordan River has major significance in Judaism and Christianity as itâ s said that the tribes of Israel crossed it with Joshua and that Jesus Christ was baptised in its waters by John the Baptist At Bethany Beyond the Jordan archaeologists are excavating ancient church sites ruins and caves that may have once been used by John the Baptist Visits to the Jordan River allow the observant on both sides of the banks â Israel and the Palestinian Territories to the west Jordan on the eastern shore â to take a moment to reflect or in some cases actually experience baptismal immersion Because of upstream dams and diversions the Jordan River no longer flows â deep and wideâ in some parts itâ s more like a small stream Time your visit for spring for fair weather pleasant temperatures a chance of desert wildflowers and Christian Easter celebrations Spot migrating birds at the Azraq Wetland Reserve Â Ameer Firdaus Zulkeflee Shutterstock Watch for birds at Azraq Wetland Reserve Catch sight of a desert finch Cettiâ s warbler or hoopoe lark at the Azraq Wetland Reserve just outside Amman What was once a large basin system of mudflats marshes and pools has shrunk over time to a small reserve in Jordanâ s eastern desert Azraq became a protected wetland area in and an artificial spring system maintains this reserve which still serves as an oasis stop for migratory bird species making their way between Africa and Eurasia Steady your binoculars as you tiptoe through the marsh on raised wooden walkways or duck into a hide for some surreptitious birdwatching Take in views of Wadi Rum from Lawrence of Arabia s Spring Â Richard Yoshida Shutterstock Sip from Lawrence of Arabiaâ s Spring in Wadi Rum The Martian red landscape of Wadi Rum cloaks its rare water sources that lie within its high rocky cliffs A source of particular renown Lawrence of Arabiaâ s Spring sits just above Rum village near the ruins of a former Nabataean temple The spring was named after the legendary British writer TE Lawrence as a result of its inclusion in his book Seven Pillars of Wisdom Stop below the spring on your camel or on a tour of the wadi and take minutes to hike up the rocks until you re greeted by green shrubs and some low trees As Lawrence described this leafy â paradise of just five feet square â offers cool refreshment and smells of wild mint and it affords excellent views of the Wadi Rum desert If you find yourself humming bars of the theme music from the Lawrence of Arabia film donâ t worry finding water in the desert is always cause for celebration https shop lonelyplanet
