here s what I discovered Amy C Balfour Jul min read Share Writer Amy Balfour signed up for a long awaited rafting trip down the Colorado River Here s how it went â and how you can do it too Â Draper White Getty Images No one warns you about The Groover and maybe itâ s better that they donâ t If you join a commercial rafting trip on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon youâ ll become intimately familiar with this metal sided chamber of horrors that passes for a porta potty but more on that later The Groover was one of several surprises on my day adventure which I completed in June Ahead of my trip my river outfitter Grand Canyon Expeditions emailed me a helpful pre trip checklist but I discovered that planning a trip along the Colorado River can be almost as opaque as the waters themselves Hereâ s what to expect if you decide to paddle through the Grand Canyon yourself Rafters tip If your schedule is flexible you might still be able to snag a reservation with one of the canyonâ s rafting outfitters in the commercial season runs from April through October Why I chose a commercial rafting trip to the Grand Canyon Rafting the Grand Canyon had been on my bucket list for decades Iâ d visited the canyon numerous times and its beauty and immensity always recharged my psyche like no other place Iâ d hiked from the South Rim to the Colorado River three times camped at Bright Angel Campground and bunked in the hikerâ s dorm at Phantom Ranch on two separate trips as well as exploring the North Rim But rafting Iâ d never found the time but was finally my year Advertisement Grand Canyon National Park allows two types of recreational boating trips through the canyon commercial and noncommercial The park has approved river concessioners to guide commercial trips on the river while noncommercial trips â also called private trips â are self guided Guiding your own trip is challenging and often dangerous and itâ s not recommended for those unfamiliar with the river Why did I choose commercial over private Convenience first and foremost My undergrad college Washington Lee University organizes more than a dozen educational adventures annually for alumni including a Grand Canyon rafting trip about once every five years It s wildly popular a geology professor comes along and their lectures add scientific context to the natural beauty on all sides The writer Amy Balfour and the epic scenery of the Grand Canyon Â Amy Balfour Lonely Planet Picking the right boat for a Colorado River trip If youâ re considering a commercial trip your biggest decision will be which type of boat to go for The vessels used for commercial trips include handcrafted dories shallow draft wooden boats oar powered rafts paddle steered rafts and large motorized pontoon rafts The latter as used on my trip are the only boats that can travel the canyonâ s entire mile course in a week For an overview of the outfitters and their trips check out Advantage Grand Canyon This free reservation service which earns money through referral fees zeros in on trips that match your interests and timeframe A typical day on the wonderful Colorado River Â Amy Balfour Lonely Planet Who can handle the canyon You donâ t have to be rich ripped or even a grown up to raft the canyon In fact when it comes to bucket list adventures a Grand Canyon rafting trip is one of the most â doableâ experiences for the average traveler Kids as young as eight are allowed on many motorized rafting trips while for oar steered and paddling trips the minimum age rises to or years and the minimum age for dories is years There are no upper age limits my trip which had passengers included teenagers in high school as well as travelers in their Whole length canyon trips typically run more than sets of rapids on the Colorado River rated from Class through which differs from the Class I to Class V rating typically used to classify rapids on American whitewater Nearly of these sets of rapids drop or more and the show stopping Lava Falls drops Learn about Native cultures and Tribal lands on this Arizona road trip Add on hikes in the Grand Canyon Most trips include daytime hikes into side canyons These are typically no more than miles out and back but the trails can be steep and hot Several travelers on my trip skipped the longer hikes and this was no problem for the operators As well as paddling and walking guests also help load and unload every travelerâ s dry bags for overnight stops which definitely gives your arms a workout The key requirements for rafting the Grand Canyon A love of adventure and a willingness to embrace the challenges of the canyon which is affectionately known as Riverworld Advertisement Days hikes into side canyons are all part of the Grand Canyon experience Â Amy Balfour Lonely Planet Unexpected items that you should pack Based on my own experiences and an informal survey of my fellow rafters there are several items of unexpected importance that you should pack My first recommendation is a rain suit comprising a waterproof jacket and pants Lees Ferry is miles downriver from Glen Canyon Dam and the water powering from the dam is snowmelt from the Rockies so it s cold hovering around degrees By the afternoon some of my wave splashed raftmates were visibly shivering even though canyon temperatures hovered near degrees Another must bring is a sarong â and not just for women A sarong dipped in the cold river waters can be draped over your legs on the raft protecting them from the sun and cooling you down while floating along calm stretches of the Colorado Onshore a sarong doubles as a privacy curtain It can also be used as an impromptu yoga mat and as a light sheet at night if itâ s too warm to climb into your sleeping bag Also consider mixing electrolytes into your water Commercially available electrolytes include minerals such as sodium potassium and magnesium that help regulate fluid levels in your body I found they gave me a much needed boost of energy on hot and strenuous days Finally buy quality carabiners to keep your water bottle and your day pack attached to the boat I bought a few small low grade carabiners from a big box store and they broke just about every time I tried clipping them to the security rope on the raft Our beds for the night on the edge of the Colorado River Â Amy Balfour Lonely Planet The thing not to bring modesty Commercial rafts land on rock dotted sandbars for lunch breaks day hikes and bathroom pit stops One surprise of the trip We were not allowed to â take a leakâ onshore river runners must pee in the Colorado River If every one of the boaters who visit annually urinated in the sand a malodorous litter box situation would ensue How did this work in practice After our raft was secured men walked a short distance in one direction while women walked in the other The recommended stance for women Crouching in the shallows and dropping our drawers We couldnâ t walk too far into the river because of the powerful current but the current did ensure that our liquid waste was quickly dispersed At night we were given plastic â pee buckets â We placed these vessels a few steps from our cots pouring the contents into the river in the morning like a century version of the Wild West chamber pot Ladies sleep in a short sundress it makes the process easier From stargazing to ghost towns the best places to visit in Arizona Now back to the Groover Reserved for â number twos â the Groover is a metal box topped with a toilet seat and lid According to canyon lore the name stems from the days when the waste box was a small ammo can that wore grooves into the legs and backsides of anyone who sat upon it Also called the â loo with a view â the Groover is portable Our crew stashed ours in a scenic but secluded spot a short walk from the camping area Two rolls of toilet paper tucked into a plastic baggie and propped on a supply canister doubled as The Key â if the baggie was missing the Groover was occupied And yes standing in the Groover line is awkward but I had some memorable conversations while waiting my turn The group explores a huge cave on the banks of the Colorado River Â Amy Balfour Lonely Planet How to survive group dynamics in the Grand Canyon On my trip I took to heart this travel truism every group trip has a jerk and if you donâ t know who it is then itâ s you On a multi day adventure trip where bonding and camaraderie are a fundamental part of the experience you do not want to be the jerk How to avoid this fate Donâ t be late to the raft in the morning donâ t complain too much donâ t barrel to the front of the food line and always help load and unload the boats See hidden waterfalls and breathtaking views on the best hikes in Arizona Commandeering the same seat at the front of a motorized raft is also frowned upon Waves crash here with dramatic intensity making it the prized place to sit If youâ re an adventurous type remind yourself to rotate to the middle of the raft â dubbed the Tea Room on our trip â and let others enjoy the waves at the prow Guides are a mine of information on the history geology and nature of the Grand Canyon Â Amy Balfour Lonely Planet Maximize the adventure and the meaning of your Grand Canyon trip On a few occasions I found myself hot tired and under enthused about the planned day s hiking but a fellow traveler responded to my grumblings with just the right mantra â You canâ t do it tomorrow â This carpe diem philosophy was spot on especially on a river trip that was perpetually moving forward and Iâ m glad I listened The hikes all led to memorable sites from slot canyons and towering waterfalls to fascinating petroglyphs and the mesmerizing turquoise waters of the Little Colorado River Remember to listen to your guides when they talk about geology history and conservation Iâ ll never be able to explain the Great Unconformity but immersing myself in the age and immensity of those gorgeous ancient rocks drove home my place in the universe On the last night our lead river guide reminded us that we were on this Earth for a fleetingly short time His advice Make the most of that time by bringing the camaraderie and sense of wonder experienced in Riverworld back into your everyday life Our group rests while the teal green waters of the Colorado River rush past Â Amy Balfour Lonely Planet Boating the Colorado River â how to make it happen Consider the following factors when choosing a guided trip through the Grand Canyon Weigh up the number of days you want to be on the river where you want to start and end your adventure and the type of boat youâ d prefer Most companies offer Full Canyon and Half Canyon trips Half Canyon trips require a hike in or out of the canyon typically on the mile Bright Angel Trail from the South Rim to shave off distance I d recommend the Full Canyon if youâ ve got the time When to raft the Grand Canyon You ll need to reserve a commercial trip a year or more in advance but check with the various companies to see when they release their reservation calendars Calendars can be posted up to months before the start of the season May and June are the most popular months according to Grand Canyon Expeditions whose guides have led trips here since â I believe itâ s because the weather isnâ t usually so hot the river is green and thatâ s about the time families are getting out of school â explained Taylor Lea Pratt a GCEX reservation specialist As noted by Pratt the Colorado River shimmers a dazzling shade of green in late spring and early summer because the algae tinted waters haven t yet been muddied by mountain silt Similarly the Little Colorado River a tributary of the Colorado is a luminous turquoise in late spring The monsoon season runs from mid July through early September bringing refreshing afternoon rainstorms and the occasional rainbow Wildflowers bloom in surrounding canyons in early spring adding bonus color Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address Subscribe now Subscribe to Lonely Planet
