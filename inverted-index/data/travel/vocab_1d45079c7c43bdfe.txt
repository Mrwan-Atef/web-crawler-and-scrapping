min read Share Asia offers gorgeous beaches delicious food and vistas to choose from like Man Thai beach in Da Nang Vietnam XUAN THONG Shutterstock As the worldâ s largest continent summers vary vastly in Asia You have on one end sun kissed isles where exploring in flip flops is a delicate breeze On the other end high humidity and torrential rains keep everyone strictly in the confines of air conditioned malls Venturing north may appear to be the best option for travelers However the region isnâ t foolproof to Mother Nature In Tokyo for example August s heat and humidity are exacerbated by the densely built and populated city Likewise the southeastâ s microclimates mean select islands can be a tropical haven particularly Indonesia â s archipelagos when summer is their sweet spot for blue sunny skies Of course such optimum conditions in the peak of high season equate to soaring demand and youâ ll need to plan far ahead To help weâ ve rounded up the best places in Asia to visit during the summer months of June July and August June Haeundae Beach is one of the places Busan offers on a visit Sanga Park Shutterstock Advertisement Busan South Korea Best city for K culture Seoul may be the mecca for Korean entertainment but international visitors can still get a slice of the action in Busan The country s second largest city brims with K drama shooting locations K Pop dance troupes and K beauty stores just like its northern counterpart but itâ s far less crowded and the prices are kinder on the wallet June falls off full bloom cherry blossom season and summer hasnâ t quite reached its full momentum yet Even if climate change plays tricks a slew of beaches like Haeundae offer respite Otherwise expect to enjoy the rainbow wonders of Gamcheon Culture Village and fresh catch at Jagalchi Fish Market in comfy Â F conditions Planning tip Busan was formerly a popular jumping off point for tourists hoping to tick off Japan thanks to a hour high speed ferry to Fukuoka Since that ferryâ s permanent closure in December youâ ll now need to take a minute flight or stomach an hour ferry crossing instead Visit this sandy stretch of My Khe beach in Da Nang NGUYENTHANHTUNG Getty Images Da Nang Vietnam Best region for beach hopping Vietnam experiences heavy downpours throughout the summer but thankfully thatâ s not the case along the northern coastline Da Nang is an outdoor lovers paradise whether you choose to frolic on idyllic beaches like My Khe and Non Nuoc or explore the unique architecture of sites like Dragon Bridge The coastal city has a rich Cham history which can be discovered in the Museum of Cham Sculpture Modern amenities at bargain prices make Da Nang one of the most livable Southeast Asian spots so expect your Vietnamese Dong to stretch far even in peak season Da Nang is also within an hourâ s drive of UNESCO site Hoi An Planning tip Summers in Vietnam call for copious helpings of ChÃ a traditional sweet beverage dessert soup or pudding thatâ s served cold and usually with ice for a refreshing finish Vietnamese iced coffees are also a firm favorite Try out hawker centers for eats in Singapore Kapi Ng Shutterstock Singapore Best city for diverse eats Though Singapore â s tropical climate is constant all year round June is a good time to visit due to the lower by Singaporean standards humidity Summer rain is much less frequent than the rest of the year The island nation is home to four key ethnic groups Malay Chinese Indian and Indonesian You can sample their specialties and more quite affordably at hawker centers open air community dining halls Newton Hawker Center is one of the most recognizable as it was used in the movie Crazy Rich Asians Speaking of which hawkers aside the rest of the little red dot will appear steep in comparison to its Southeast Asian neighbors Double your daily budget and explore city greats such as the futuristic Gardens by the Bay and the upscale Orchard Road Planning tip It may be up to F outside but shopping malls and even taxi cabs blast AC Bring a light sweater for your dip in and out of a cold blast July See the beautiful cityscape of Shimla Amit kg Shutterstock Advertisement Shimla India Best city for walking India may not spring to mind when it comes to cooling off but the domestic secret is Shimla The city in the northernmost state of Himachal Pradesh was once the retreat of the century British colonial government In an attempt to escape harsh summers they went to the foothills of the Himalayas turning Shimla into a British hill station packed with amenities Now Indians come to comfortably enjoy Tudorbethan and neo Gothic architecture in to F heat Walkingâ s a breeze thanks to pedestrian only zones Donâ t miss the Harry Potter esque Viceregal Lodge and the Rothney Castle and watch out for snack pinching Rhesus monkeys Planning tip Lengthy photo shoots are a big part of Indian vacation culture so expect to dodge selfie sticks and tripods during your trip Some are not used to foreigners and itâ s common for tourists to receive meet and greet requests akin to that of a rock star If youâ re okay with this keep an eye on time as a line may form Find picture perfect moments in Ubud Asyraf Rasid Shutterstock Bali Indonesia Best region for picturesque corners Thereâ s no better time to knock out the Bali bucket list than July Itâ s relatively dry and pleasantly warm F to F which means everything is oh so beautiful just like youâ ve seen on Instagram Everyone else has lush Ubud jungles and white sand beaches on their agenda too so if you canâ t beat them join them There are tours to bash out the obligatory snaps in one single day After that retreat to a villa or luxury resort for a Balinese massage or hit up a beach club and try an Arak cocktail Baliâ s packed year round but coming at the very start of July might at least help filter out families waiting for the school holidays to commence Planning tip If youâ re not a local be very careful with washed salads and even ice cubes Google â Bali Belly â and youâ ll see why Bring meds and book any important tours at the beginning of your trip in case you must reschedule Horses run in the Assy Plateau near Almaty Kazakhstan xiaoyun wu Shutterstock Almaty Kazakhstan Best city for affordable outdoor experiences July is the peak season to visit Almaty but as a relatively under the radar Asian tourist destination that means things come alive rather than get overcrowded The weather hovers between and F ideal for exploring the local museums and cathedrals or enjoying the cityâ s nightlife However with easy access to natural landscapes youâ ll want to bask in those delightful temperatures outdoors Popular day trips include Big Almaty Lake and the Trans Ili Alatau mountains both just over an hourâ s drive from town Planning tip Local delicacies include Kazy horse meat sausage Beshbarmak boiled meat and flat noodles and Shubat fermented camelâ s milk but donâ t worry if you donâ t want to spend the whole trip being adventurous Almaty has plenty of familiar Chinese Korean and Turkish dishes August Sendai is home to the Zuihoden Mausoleum mTaira Shutterstock Sendai Japan Best alternative to the famous cities Thereâ s so much more to Japan than Kyoto Tokyo and Osaka and while the tourists stampede on that holy trinity consider Sendai aka â City of Treesâ to breathe You have here everything you came to Japan for fresh sushi wacky karaoke and ancient temples but you get to experience them like a local in this young student heavy city Sendai may just be a hour bullet train from Tokyo but itâ s mountains cooler August highs are a maximum of F This is also the month of the Sendai Tanabata Festival marked by parades traditional performances and plenty of street food Planning tip Every city or region in Japan has a signature dish and in Sendai itâ s all about the beef tongue Gyutan ç ã ã gyÅ tan is thinly sliced beef tongue cooked over a charcoal grill See pandas in Chengdu China kiszon pascal Getty Images Chengdu China Best city if you love pandas Famed for being the home of giant pandas those visiting Chengdu in late August are likely to see cubs at their cutest Theyâ re actually born blind and hairless weighing just and itâ s not until a month later that their distinct markings fluff on in You can view them at the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base Average August temperatures are now F however this month is typically rather humid The magnificent Jiuzhaigou National Park is an excellent place to beat the heat due to its high elevation but if you intend on staying put in the capital of Sichuan there are plenty of AC corners in this sprawling megacity of million inhabitants Planning tip Many schools start to reopen in the last week of August so sticking to the end of the month means a fizzle down in crowds as well as fluffier baby pandas Khoton Lake in Mongolia Kirill Trifonov Shutterstock Altai Mountains Mongolia Best region for going off the grid With over hours of daylight in August you can take your time in the Altai Mountains of Mongolia The area has a wealth of archaeological sites including the ruins of the ancient city of Kharakhot There are also snow capped mountains to hike or climb and verdant valleys that teem with native maral deer and argali sheep You may decide to camp at Khoton Lake or join a homestay at a traditional village for a peek into local nomadic culture Wi fi is either limited or nonexistent here so all you can do is surrender to the back to basics way of living and blissfully disconnect from the modern Planning tip Altai Tavan Bogd is located in a remote part of Mongolia and it is not the easiest place to navigate It requires plenty of planning and a local guide is recommended As youâ re here during the peak season there should be plenty of operators and transportation options available Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us
