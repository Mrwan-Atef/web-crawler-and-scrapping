next day s scheduled flight of the world s most powerful rocket A recently retired Canadian federal employee Ebbers drove from his home in Toronto to SpaceX s spaceport in Boca Chica to watch his first rocket launch He made the mile trip alone sleeping overnight at rest stops inside his Tesla Model Y At dawn Ebbers and I were among the thousands who had gathered to see the first test flight of the engine Super Heavy booster as it carried its Starship upper stage built by SpaceX to deliver payload and passengers to the moon and Mars The crowd at Isla Blanca Park on the island s southern tip

on April We saw the rocket beginning to lift he says But the booster exhaust blasted huge chunks of concrete from the launchpad suspected of damaging some engines and three others failed to ignite at liftoff The foot tall rocket staggered through the sky as it climbed above feet After nearly four minutes of flight Starship and its booster self destructed never even having had the chance to separate stages It didn t matter Ebbers said of the untimely end The spacecraft flew and we all got to see it He may be a first timer but no launch tourist could state their creed any better Here s
