sublime uses of this starchy banana like fruit is for making pasteles â stuffed plantain dough parcels Although they look similar to Mexican tamales thereâ s no corn in the dough used to make pasteles Itâ s simply mashed plantain wrapped around a meat filling and then cooked en hoja wrapped in plantain or banana leaves Versions using yautÃ a tubers or yuca cassava are also popular It might be a little tricky to find pasteles at the major Punta Cana resorts but itâ s not difficult to get some in town Pastedeli on Ave Presidente Roosevelt takes orders for pickup or delivery Detour Take a short

for good Dominican food and a taste of authentic Dominican life Discover ancient petroglyphs at Cueva de las Maravillas To learn more about the indigenous TaÃ no people and their unique customs the
