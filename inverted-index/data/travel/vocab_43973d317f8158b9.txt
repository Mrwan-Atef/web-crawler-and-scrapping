min read Share Dive into the clear waters of the Indian Ocean off the coast of Zanzibar Becker Stefan Shutterstock Though many people s first introduction to Tanzania is gazing open mouthed at footage of huge numbers of wildebeest and zebra moving through Serengeti National Park there is so much more to see and do in this beautiful nation There are several national parks that are scattered like jewels across the country and they boast the largest concentration of wildlife in Africa Tanzania s coastline is dotted with stunning beaches and its paradise islands are renowned for their beauty lapped by the Indian Ocean and the teeming wildlife underneath the waves In the bustling cities the buildings tell stories of battles and conquest depression and victory It would take a lifetime to see everything on offer but start your to do list now with these unmissable experiences in Tanzania Go diving and snorkeling in Zanzibar Zanzibar is Africaâ s paradise with warm sky blue waters gently lapping shores of fine white sand that stretch for miles â the stuff dreams are made of â but wait until you explore what lies beneath Schools of colorful fish frolicking bottlenose and spinner dolphins and majestic whale sharks deftly glide in and around the captivating kaleidoscopic coral reef Advertisement Planning tip The waters around Mnemba Island and Kizimkazi Beach are the best places on the archipelago for aquatic adventures although any of the numerous beaches offer wonderful opportunities A hot air balloon ride over the Serengeti at sunrise is an unforgettable experience Diana Robinson See the Serengeti from a hot air balloon Very little on earth speaks magic like surveying the endless plains of the Serengeti The Maasai people have called this region home for centuries and they have lived side by side with an extraordinary array of fauna and flora unlike anything else in the world At dawn when the hot air balloon is fired up the sun surfaces slowly into view and the balloon rises to greet the color streaked clouds Below thousands of antelope warthogs zebras lions rhinos and elephants wander about as they start their day Planning tip The Great Migration takes place from May to September and this might just be the perfect place to watch it Book well in advance as this is the busiest tourist season of the year Spend the night in an underwater room off the coast of Pemba The Manta Resort s Underwater Room is a wooden structure anchored on the Indian Ocean floor just off the coast of Pemba island In the midst of calm cerulean waters this edifice almost appears lonely as it seems to float at its own whim But rest assured all is secure On the deck you can catch the kisses of the sun by day and at night gaze into the eyes of a million stars When youâ re ready take the stairs down to a small modern underwater bedroom surrounded by glass walls in which you ll meet the majesty of the ocean You ll pay for the privilege but it s thrilling just thinking about what awaits you each night Summit Mt Kilimanjaro Mt Kilimanjaro is Africaâ s tallest mountain and a thirst trap for adventure seekers Thereâ s truly nothing more exciting than making your summit at Uhuru Peak uhuru means freedom in KiSwahili which stands at on Kiboâ s crater rim Advertisement Planning tips The average summit duration is five days although some routes may take a few days longer depending on terrain foot traffic and stops to take in the scenery There are approximately eight possible routes to Uhuru Peak Marangu and Rongai being the easier ones Machame Shira and Lemosho are considered more difficult but thereâ s little else that shouts victory quite like planting your feet on Africaâ s highest point The Rock serves incredible dishes in an unforgettable setting Nowaczyk Shutterstock Enjoy a meal at the Rock in Zanzibar The Rock is a quaint restaurant built upon a bed of stone on Michamvi s Pingwe Beach Zanzibar In low tide you can walk up the stairs and into this small boutique of incredible flavors and aromas but during high tide it becomes its own island and a boat must bring you to its doors â hence its nickname Tidal Island The Rock experience more than satiates your physical appetite it elevates it While European inspired everything on the menu is a fusion of local ingredients seafood fruit and vegetables and sultry spices â the perfect mixture of Asian and African influences The grilled lobster served with scarab potatoes and salad is heavenâ s gift to mere mortals Eat your heart out at Forodhani Night Market in Zanzibar Each day as the sun sets over the Forodhani Gardens the frenetic pace of everyday life on Zanzibar decelerates In its place chefs in white jackets set up stalls to create a medley of Tanzaniaâ s finest street food The tables are laden with falafel cutlets of tandoori chicken nyama choma roasted meat sizzling skewers of octopus fish and other seafood spicy samosas and coconut bread Try the Zanzibar pizza which is really an omelet of fried eggs dough and diced veggies Wash it down with cool sugarcane juice Swim with whale sharks on Mafia Island Mafia Island also known as Whale Shark Island is Tanzaniaâ s best kept secret Like Zanzibar it s an archipelago but it has little of the traffic that flows to Unguja Island The experience of swimming through the coral amidst smaller fish while watching the worldâ s biggest fish is one youâ ll cherish â although enormous theyâ re faster than you think Planning tip Whale Shark Island welcomes these gentle giants from October to March There are breathtaking views from the crater rim of Ol Doinyo Lengai guenterguni Getty Images Climb Ol Doinyo Lengai an active volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai is an active volcano located on a

the Slave Market Exhibit in Zanzibar From until Zanzibar was home to one of the worldâ s most notorious markets for trading enslaved people Tippu Tip was the regionâ s most scandalous and wealthy trader and his house is now a museum open to the public The Slave Market Exhibit begins with a journey to a sculpture of chained enslaved people â using the original chains â created by Clara SÃ rnÃ s

people of Iringa in southern Tanzania The Hadzabe people live on the coast of Lake Eyasi and are one of the last hunter gatherer peoples of Africa not unlike the San of Southern Africa although no

activity in which the men go in search of bushmeat and the women gather roots and berries A day offers non voyeuristic insights into daily life rituals beliefs and ceremonies A visit to Olduvai Gorge
