Food writer Dina Macki on Omani cuisine and Zanzibari flavours Dina Macki s new book blends the cuisines of Oman and Zanzibar Photograph by Patricia Niven TRAVEL Bahari food writer Dina Macki on Omani cuisine and Zanzibari flavours In her new cookbook Dina Macki examines the intertwined but distinct cuisines of Oman and Zanzibar exploring how they were shaped by seafarers and the ocean itself By Qin Xie April This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK How has your heritage influenced your food My mum was born in Zanzibar to Omani Zanzibari and Iranian Zanzibari parents They came from Swahili tribes so they cooked a lot of Zanzibari and Swahili coastal food there s always a lot of coconut and the food is really spicy with lots of citrus flavours My dad s family are Omani from the capital Muscat with Bahraini and Iraqi tribal heritage so they use a lot of dried limes They also use a lot of dates That comes from being in the north where there are date palms everywhere Dina Macki is the author of Bahari Recipes from an Omani Kitchen and Beyond Photograph by Patricia Niven How would you describe Oman Although Oman is a Middle Eastern country that borders other Arab nations it s also close to Somalia Iran and India And years ago it had an empire that included the Swahili coast around Zanzibar Because of all the trade it s very multicultural In the north of Oman where Muscat is it s very dry and hot with a gorgeous coastline and beaches The interior to the west is very mountainous and it s here you have the Ad Dakhiliyah governorate where the most delicious pomegranates are grown As you travel further south you pass the desert before you reach the Dhofar governorate which mimics the Swahili coastline with its blue sea white beaches and coconut palms In August the monsoon turns everything green and you get incredible waterfalls How does the food vary regionally Oman is very tribal and every community takes their influence from somewhere The Lawati tribe in the north originally came from Iran and Pakistan and their food incorporates a lot of Indian flavours they have a high tolerance to chilli and use a lot of spices The same goes for the Balochi people who originated in Balochistan a region split between Iran Afghanistan and Pakistan The interior tribes would have been Bedouins who travelled throughout the Arab world Their food is very meat heavy and they love honey as it travels well they also like to preserve things In the south near the sea the people are mainly of East African heritage and their food is very coconut based In the mountains they have a lot of meat which they ll dry to travel with They also love using wheat and fresh cow s or camel s milk What makes Omani food distinctive Definitely the variety We don t have a lot of vegetables because of the climate but we use a lot of spices and draw on so many different flavour combinations We also have a lot of finger foods like samosas and fritters which is that Zanzibari influence In terms of eating culture it s extremely rude if you visit someone and you don t eat with them No matter what time of the day you visit Omanis will make sure it drags into lunch or dinner The men and the women will go into separate majlis sitting rooms The minute you walk in you ll be given tea or coffee and fruits The main dishes served family style on big plates are then laid out on the floor where everyone sits and eats with only their right hand After that the sweet things are served You ll have halwa made with sugarcane ghee spices nuts and dried fruit with coffee to finish What are some typical Omani ingredients Limes grow across the country People dry them or brine them for a stronger flavour and take them everywhere because they preserve really well Cooked slowly and a lot of Omani dishes require slow cooking they release an intense citrussy flavour Honey is also found everywhere Dates are common too but this stops once you get to the Dhofar region where the climate becomes very wet and humid In terms of spices cardamom cinnamon black pepper and cloves are all important and the Lawati Balochi and Swahili tribes also eat a lot of chilli Saffron is an Iranian influence but it s grown in Zanzibar too Is there one especially popular dish The majority of people in the north will tell you the national dish is shuwa eaten during Eid although in the interior and the south there are many governorates that don t have shuwa at all It s basically meat coated in a mixture of black pepper dried chilies cloves dried limes cardamom and cinnamon each family s recipe will be different It s then wrapped in banana leaves and put in a sack made from date palm fronds Everyone in the village gets together and dances and sings as they put their sack in a tanoor fire pit where it s cooked for hours Coconut forms the base of many Zanzibari dishes and is often used as a substitute for water says Macki Photograph by Patricia Niven Recipe Spinach coconut shakshuka This shakshuka is based on a Zanzibari dish known as mchicha or mboga which means spinach or vegetables in Swahili If you mention these names we instantly know the dish will be made with coconut Coconut forms the base of many Zanzibari dishes and is often used as a substitute for water Although mchicha tastes amazing it isn t the most showstopping dish to look at so I decided to use it as a base for shakshuka This dish is best served with toast Serves Takes minutes Ingredients tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil onion thinly sliced garlic cloves finely chopped tsp ground turmeric tsp ground cumin tomatoes finely diced spinach can coconut milk green chilli roughly chopped optional lime juiced Handful of fresh coriander chopped eggs Pomegranate seeds to garnish optional Black olives to garnish optional Method Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat Add the onion and garlic and sweat for mins then stir in the ground spices Add the tomatoes and fry for mins more Add the spinach a handful at a time and fry for mins until it s all wilted Pour in the coconut milk then add the chilli if using and its seeds plus lime juice Salt to taste and simmer for mins until the coconut s thickened and there s only a little liquid left Add the coriander and stir well then leave to simmer for another mins Add the coriander and stir well then leave to simmer for another mins Make holes in the mixture and crack an egg into each hole Cover the pan with a lid and leave the eggs to cook through for mins until the egg whites are cooked and you have a runny yolk alternatively leave it for longer to get a hard yolk if you prefer Sprinkle over the pomegranates and or olives if using and serve Recipe Honeycomb bread Qaranqasho is an Omani celebration that takes place on the day of Ramadan Children dress in traditional clothing and mothers prepare nibbles and sweet baskets then open up their doors to all Khaliat nahal is a sweet yeasted bread known for its honeycomb shape that s only served during Ramadan especially on Qaranqasho This recipe is found in both Oman and Yemen it s always filled with cheese but the syrups drizzled on top differ from family to family It s best served freshly baked and warm while the cheese is melted but it ll keep for days in an airtight container Makes pieces Takes hour plus rising Ingredients plus tbsp warm milk fast action dried yeast plain flour caster sugar eggs sesame seeds for sprinkling sea salt flakes For the syrup caster sugar tbsp runny honey orange juiced cardamom pods crushed For the filling mozzarella soft cream cheese Method Combine all the ingredients for the syrup in a saucepan with water Set over a high heat and bring to the boil Once it starts bubbling boil for exactly mins then remove from the heat and leave to cool completely Don t stir the syrup while it s boiling and make sure it s entirely cool before you use it the idea is to pour the cooled syrup over the hot bread Pour milk into a bowl Add the yeast and leave to sit for mins Combine the flour sugar and eggs in a mixer or large bowl Add the yeast mixture and combine Knead until the dough is soft and smooth this will take mins in a mixer or mins by hand Cover with a clean damp cloth and leave to rise for hr mins or until the dough has doubled in size Once the dough has risen divide into even sized pieces then shape them into balls Take the first ball and press it flat then place a little of the mozzarella and soft cheese into the middle use around of each as you don t want to overfill Bring the rest of the dough around the cheese to encase it then pinch the edges together to seal roll it back into a ball and flatten very slightly Repeat with the remaining dough balls mozzarella and soft cheese Place the filled balls on a baking tray lined with baking parchment ideally a pizza tray so you can arrange them in a honeycomb shape Make sure to leave a little space between each of the balls so they have room to spread as they rise Cover with a clean damp cloth and leave to rise for mins Heat oven to fan gas When the balls are ready to bake brush them with the remaining milk and sprinkle over the sesame seeds Bake for mins until golden Pour the cooled syrup over the balls as soon as they come out of the oven and let it seep into the dough alternatively brush the syrup on if you don t want too much Sprinkle over some crushed sea salt flakes to finish Allow to cool for around mins then serve warm so the cheese is melted and delicious The cake is inspired by a Zanzibari dessert called ndizi mbivu with sweet plantains stewed with coconut milk and cardamom Photograph by Patricia Niven Recipe Plantain or banana coconut cardamom cake There s a pudding from Zanzibar called ndizi mbivu which is basically overripe sweet plantains stewed with coconut milk and cardamom As a kid the look of it put me off I must have been about when I began to understand how something so simple could yield so much comfort and flavour I have a recipe for it in my book but this prettier version brings the same ingredients into a cake I like to serve it warm but you can leave it to cool just be sure to remove from the tin while still warm It ll keep for days in an airtight container Serves Takes minutes Ingredients plantain or banana puréed plus sliced plain flour tsp baking powder caster sugar soft light

evenly Once the sugar has all melted add the butter and keep stirring until smooth Arrange the sliced banana or plantain in the base of the prepared tin then pour over the caramel Set aside Combine the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and whisk until smooth being careful not to over whisk Pour the batter over the banana and caramel Bake for mins then reduce the heat to fan gas and bake for
