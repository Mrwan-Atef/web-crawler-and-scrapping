In Charleston Black history is being told through a new lens TRAVEL In Charleston Black history is being told through a new lens The former slave trade capital of North America reckons with its past as cultural sites set the record straight Built in as a slave auction gallery the Old Slave Mart now serves as a museum recounting Charleston s role in the domestic slave trade Photograph by Richard Ellis Alamy By Jalen Coats June min read None of the exhibits at the Old Slave Mart Museum in Charleston South Carolina will tell you that the fingerprints pressed into the building s bricks are those of enslaved people No poster explains that prior to the Civil War enslaved African and African descended people at nearby plantations made the material by hand harvesting clay out of rivers packing it into molds continuously feeding the fire for the kiln When Ista Clarke was hired as the museum s operations manager he noticed the tiny fingerprints in a brick three months into the job most likely from an enslaved child tasked with turning bricks over by hand as they dried He began to curate dozens of photos of the bricks from across South Carolina and Georgia calling the marks an impression easily missed The museum located inside the concrete shell of the last standing slave auction hall in South Carolina summons a painful scene from that era with a soundtrack of clinking chains and bartering salesmen Three silhouettes labeled trader slave and buyer cover one wall Placards detail a day in the life of a slave trader The museum like many other sites in Charleston is still figuring out how to tell local Black history after centuries of suppression Enslaved West Africans would uses sweetgrass baskets like these to separate the husk from the grain in rice fields In the baskets were named South Carolina s state handicraft Photograph by H Mark Weldman Alamy Between the early days of the Carolina colony in and the federal ban on importation of persons about percent of enslaved Africans forced into North America passed through Charleston s harbor Slavers confined those who survived the passage to various warehouses and slave markets until selling them to the highest bidder Historians estimate that more than percent of all African Americans can trace at least one ancestor to this area June marks one year since the city council voted to remove the statue of prominent Southern politician and defender of slavery John C Calhoun citing the police killing of George Floyd and the voices of protest that followed as catalysts It s also three years since the city apologized for its role in the slave trade After years of planning the International African American Museum is scheduled to open next year on the plot of the former Gadsden s Wharf a feat that South Carolina Democratic representative and museum board member James E Clyburn has called long overdue As monuments fall how does the world reckon with a racist past Yet the city s path to preserving and presenting Black history has been a contentious one filled with starkly different narratives about its role in making America It s about the ancestors says Clarke It s always been about the ancestors But unfortunately the city doesn t know that Reckoning with racism and its legacies When the original Old Slave Mart Museum opened in it was the first and for many decades the only museum dedicated to the slave trade in the United States The museum s founder a white Ohioan named Miriam B Wilson filled the gallery with crafts like hand sewn sheets and ironworks made by enslaved people Even though the mart was a commercial epicenter for the buying and selling of human beings the museum s exhibits reflected Wilson s belief that the brutality of slavery had been overstated and that it was primarily a civilizing institution Take a virtual tour of South Carolina s only civil rights museum Those kinds of views were not uncommon in Charleston at the time and they permeated through the budding movement to protect its colonial era architecture There s zero question that the history of the preservation movement in Charleston is a history of elite whites says Winslow Hastie about the city s influential preservation movement that took root during Jim Crow Hastie is a generation plantation owner and president and CEO of the nonprofit Historic Charleston Foundation HCF The HCF is trying to change the course of a preservation movement that s neglected Black history and simultaneously displaced Black people through restoration projects that systematically gentrified parts of Charleston Some of that course change is happening at the Foundation s house museums At the Aiken Rhett House opened in the audio tour begins with the workspaces and living quarters of the people who were enslaved there Hastie believes the choice to replace docent led tours with audio was about achieving consistency as much as avoiding deep seated bias Back then he says referring to the telling true history about the institution of slavery and what it did for the economy of Charleston was more controversial The order of the tour subverts the typical narrative where you start at the big fancy house continues Hastie explaining that the Aiken Rhett House lent itself to a more expansive interpretation of the lives of the enslaved because of the rare intactness of the outbuildings Who owns history Americans push to be more inclusive in honoring the past At the HCF s other museum the Nathaniel Russell House restoration of the enslaved quarters is currently underway Hastie calls the century rats nests or middens found tucked between the kitchen house walls time capsules for architectural historians The preserved bundles offer clues about the people who lived there rice husks scraps of letters a whole piece of an enslaved man s probably a carriage driver s livery More than eight decades since its opening the Old Slave Mart Museum no longer features Wilson s collection The City of Charleston purchased the museum building in after the attraction closed due to financial woes Reopened as museum in the site now covers the evolution of the property and the local slave trade Although Clarke no longer works there he still believes the museum will one day embody the sacred space it has the potential to be Filling in the gaps of public history When Michael Allen joined the National Park Service in June he noticed that something was missing from the historical narratives at the Charleston properties At forts Moultrie and Sumter there was no mention of slavery even though the forts were built by enslaved laborers The pest houses where captive Africans were left to quarantine after being hauled across the Atlantic Ocean were absent from information about Sullivan s Island Instead the focus narrowed in on military history the defeat of the Royal Navy in and the first shots of the Civil War a war that according to the official narrative was fought over tariffs and states rights Either I was out of place or the Park Service was out of touch Allen says and I didn t believe I was out of place Learn how National Parks are working to combat racism Through numerous projects over the course of four decades Allen helped the Park Service improve its interpretation of Black history One of those projects included the creation of the Gullah Geechee Heritage Cultural Corridor which runs along the coast from Pender County North Carolina to St Johns County Florida The Gullah Geechee people are descendants of West Africans who due to their isolation on sea and barrier islands during enslavement retained many of their African traditions and developed distinctive foodways crafts spiritual practices and language The corridor highlights their vast contribution to the history and culture of the Lowcountry During a June remembrance ceremony the Gullah community on Sullivan s Island South Carolina dance to honor their deceased relatives Photograph by Richard Ellis Alamy At the same time that Allen was helping the Park Service expand its interpretive approach post Civil Rights Charleston was coming to terms with its incomplete version of public history The tourists who had powered the city s economy since the early were increasingly interested in the Black culture that the city s leadership suppressed As African American heritage tourism took off in the independent tour guides picked up the slack where official sites lagged Damon Fordham who leads a Lost Histories of Black Charleston tour sees himself as carrying on the storytelling work that s preserved Charleston s Black history all these years I deal a lot with the obscure and the social situations that lead to them says Fordham One of the stops on his tour is the former City Jail on Magazine Street where he points out fingerprints in the brick walkway and shares that those bricks likely came from Boone Hall Plantation in Mt Pleasant the same place his great great grandparents were enslaved The tides in South Carolina and its oldest city have continued to move toward a fuller representation of Black history the city council s unanimous vote to remove the Calhoun statue and more divided vote to apologize for slavery attest to that Sweetgrass baskets woven with techniques carried over from Africa is recognized as the state craft The bridge that crosses the Combahee River where Harriet Tubman raided Confederate troops and freed hundreds of enslaved people bears the abolitionist s name These changes are the result of ongoing and centuries long preservation protest and advocacy work part of what Allen calls higher consciousness He describes the forthcoming International African American Museum as a linchpin in the movement forward an opportunity for a new generation of people to take the baton and move it further than I could ever imagine Jalen Coats is a writer and producer who has worked on projects for VICE The Huffington Post and HBO and is currently based in
