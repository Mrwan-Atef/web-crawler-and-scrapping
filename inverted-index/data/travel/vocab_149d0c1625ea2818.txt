time as outstanding feats of engineering Perhaps their most important role however was as socio economic lifelines for isolated communities in this mountainous region The railways helped to link rural people together as part of a rapidly modernizing India Related Photos of Life Aboard the Longest Train Ride Through India The small gauge Darjeeling Himalayan Railway often called the toy train for its diminutive size opened in The engineering project that established this rail line was nothing short of monumental The original mile kilometer run climbed from feet meters at Siliguri to some feet

levels of arched galleries reminiscent of ancient Rome s aqueducts These railways are a historic holy trinity for train aficionados but they are more than dusty relics of an empire All three are still fully operational today and a ride on any of them reveals the incredible engineering achievements that brought rail service to these rugged locales The railways face intermittent problems due to political unrest in some regions They are also at the mercy of seasonal storms which can wash out tracks and roads and necessitate extensive repairs Maintenance of these treasures can be difficult and expensive but their high appeal to tourists helps to keep them running How to Get There The lower stations of these mountain railways are accessible by conventional Indian rail lines or by bus
