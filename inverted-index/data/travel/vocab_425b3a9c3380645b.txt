A Guide to Easter Island Chile LEARN THE MYSTERIES OF THE MOAI TRAVEL WORLD HERITAGE Discover the Mysteries of Easter Island The isolated Rapa Nui developed a distinct architectural and artistic culture that weathered the centuries June min read Rapa Nui s mysterious moai statues stand in silence but speak volumes about the achievements of their creators The stone blocks carved into head and torso figures average feet meters tall and tons The effort to construct these monuments and move them around the island must have been considerable but no one knows exactly why the Rapa Nui people undertook such a task Most scholars suspect that the moai were created to honor ancestors chiefs or other important personages However no written and little oral history exists on the island so it s impossible to be certain A Polynesian society blossomed in this unlikely locale after hardy souls somehow navigated a fleet of wooden outrigger canoes to this tiny speck in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean Here in isolation some miles kilometers west of South America and miles kilometers from the nearest neighboring island the Rapa Nui developed a distinct architectural and artistic culture That culture reached its zenith during the tenth to centuries when the Rapa Nui carved and erected some moai across the island It is generally thought that the Rapa Nui s demise resulted from an environmental catastrophe of their own making It s not clear when the islands were first settled estimates range from A D to It s also not clear how quickly the island ecosystem was wrecked but a major factor appears to be the cutting of millions of giant palms to clear fields or make fires It is possible that Polynesian rats arriving with human settlers may have eaten enough seeds to help to decimate the trees Either way loss of the trees exposed the island s rich volcanic soils to serious erosion When Europeans arrived in they found the island mostly barren and its inhabitants few Today s tourists are numerous and most visit the Rano Raraku quarry which yielded the stones used for almost all of the island s moai Rapa Nui s ancient inhabitants left the quarry in a fascinating condition it is home to some statues which appear in all stages of completion Meanwhile across the entire island many moai are reversing the creation process and deteriorating rapidly from priceless carvings back into plain rock The volcanic stone is subject to weathering and intensive conservation efforts are needed to help preserve Rapa Nui s stone legacy in its present awe inspiring state Moai Rapanui artisans carved the giant statues called moai centuries ago from volcanic rock at a quarry a mile away By the century all of Easter s moai had been toppled by whom or what is unclear
