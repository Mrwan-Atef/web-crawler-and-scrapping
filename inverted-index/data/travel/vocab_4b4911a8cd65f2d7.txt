A Roman era superhighway is disappearing Italy has a plan to save it MAGAZINE A Roman era superhighway is disappearing Italy has a plan to save it The Appian Way symbolized the Roman Empire s might Now Italy is restoring the ancient road hoping to create a pilgrimage route through history Rome s third century Arch of Drusus marks the start of a planned mile walking route along the Appian Way that will immerse travelers in less visited parts of Italy The road s original starting point is still unknown By Nina Strochlic Photographs and video by Andrea Frazzetta June min read There s a McDonald s on the outskirts of Rome where after ordering a pancetta laden Big Mac you can peer through the glass floor and see a few yards below flat gray paving stones of an ancient Roman road and twisted skeletons embedded in a two millennia old gutter These are remnants of an offshoot of Europe s first major highway the Appian Way The route begun in B C meanders out of the city and across Italy s southern regions until it reaches the eastern port city of Brindisi It helped inspire the saying All roads lead to Rome and in Italy it is still called Regina Viarum the Queen of Roads But its legacy has been largely neglected buried with its stones under millennia of history Now an Italian government project is under way to transform the Appian Way Via Appia into a pilgrimage route from buzzing Rome to nautical Brindisi a quiet city on the heel of Italy s boot In its roughly mile span across the country the Appia takes many forms a forested dirt path a town plaza a highway It s not always scenic or pleasant but it is an immersion into a slice of Italy few tourists see When construction began on the Appian Way in B C it was the first of highways that fanned out from Rome It would later stretch hundreds of miles to the port city of Brindisi Today the so called Queen of Roads has been obscured by modern Italy but an ambitious government plan might bring it out of the shadows Before the crowds come though the Italian government first must dig out the Appia and in some cases find it That s why on a fall morning I found myself looking down at the road from an outpost of a hamburger empire In Rome the Appia is an mile long stretch of well preserved archaeological park The last leg of this park is a woodsy uphill path Then the Appia largely vanishes under asphalt for miles Its last appearance in the Eternal City is beneath the McDonald s There lies this small offshoot of the Appia one of the rare segments that have recently been excavated and preserved When I ask a restaurant manager about the ancient cobblestones he calls to a woman in sneakers sitting at a corner table She introduces herself as Pamela Cerino the archaeologist who dug out the road in In what I consider an earth shattering coincidence Cerino just happens to be visiting to discuss future projects at the site We exit the restaurant and descend a staircase to the ancient cobblestones The project was made on purpose so if you want to look at the road you don t have to come into McDonald s Cerino tells me Three skeletons lie in the gutter replicas of the bones she originally unearthed there Above us through the glass ceiling we can see families feasting on McNuggets In Roman times the Appian Way shuttled goods soldiers livestock and ideas across southern Italy Herders still take their flocks to graze along the road in what is now the Appia Antica Archaeological Park in Rome Ilaria Cavaterra a conservation student restores mosaic floors at Rome s grand Villa dei Quintili at the fifth mile of the Via Appia The residence was so coveted that Emperor Commodus is said to have killed its owners and moved in himself in the second century This palace if it s well preserved can give to the tourists and all the people the full experience of life in ancient Rome says Serena di Gaetano a mosaic conservation expert who oversees the project At Italy s Central Institute for Restoration specialist Adriano Casagrande repairs a bust known as the Philosopher s Head It was found during excavations of the Villa dei Quintili A worker serves customers at a McDonald s on the outskirts of Rome where an offshoot of the Appia was found during the restaurant s construction The ruins were turned into a museum and a glass floor allows diners to marvel at the stones from above When a piece of the Appia was initially discovered during construction locals feared the fast food franchise was buying up old Roman treasures Actually Cerino says archaeological sites often are reburied for preservation because their upkeep is so expensive As I come to learn glimpses of the Appia are few and far between and it s lucky this one ended up seen at all I The route The via Appia intersects cities villages mountains and farmland as it crosses four regions and a hundred municipalities in Italy Most of it has been paved into obscurity under Strada Statale a busy road But its original stones sometimes appear alongside a cocktail bar in a village square under heavy tarps in an overgrown field The Appia as envisioned by Roman administrator Appius Claudius was a tool for military domination Enslaved people and laborers dug out an estimated million cubic feet of dirt and stone for each freshly paved mile the mile measurement itself was a Roman invention Claudius named it after himself a rare practice in those days that suggests its importance but went blind and ultimately died before it was completed The Appia barreled through the country in a nearly straight line carrying the Roman Army as the empire consumed southern Italy and embarked east via the sea to spread its dominion abroad It was the first of bustling roads that shot out from Rome Accounts of travel along the Appia began with Latin poet Horace around B C and it has had no shortage of articulate admirers since But appreciation for the road as a feat of engineering faded after the Roman Empire began to collapse in A D and the Appia gradually fell out of use In an book Charles Dickens described tombs and temples overthrown and prostrate Then in Italian writer Paolo Rumiz decided to walk the Appia for La Repubblica newspaper The only problem There was no modern map of the route He contacted Riccardo Carnovalini a prominent hiker who has spent nearly four decades traversing Italy For two months Carnovalini overlaid military maps ancient shepherd paths and satellite imagery to plot the Appia s course Then he loaded it into a GPS and walked alongside Rumiz Every year millions of tourists visit sites like the Forum in downtown Rome Just a few miles south the Appia Antica Archaeological Park drew about visitors in the year before the COVID pandemic hit Rumiz s journey drew the attention of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and in the Italian government announced a plan to resurrect the route Centuries of lawless development had left archaeological treasures in private hands and ancient villas recklessly remodeled Preservation has begun but without visitors the Appia could be forgotten again Walking Carnovalini tells me when I later meet him on the Appia s trail is the most political act one can do to change the landscape But many obstacles are keeping walkers away namely a difficult to find route few accommodations and little supportive infrastructure Enter Angelo Costa founder of Studio Costa one of the three architectural firms tasked with turning the Appia into a walkable journey His proposal has a historical precedent Ancient Romans following the Appia encountered a station to swap out their horses every miles and a guesthouse every miles Costa envisions an updated version with walking segments each about six hours The Appia runs through the ancient city of Minturnae outside the modern town of Minturno With funds from the Ministry of Cultural Heritage archaeologists unearthed a piece of the road that had once been filled with building materials and statues apparently in an effort to block enemy armies from crossing the town We ve been invaded by everyone until World War II says archaeologist Gianmatteo Matullo This is where the real richness of Italian cultural heritage comes from Travelers will explore the theaters of famed gladiator battles sleep in simple guesthouses and taste regional delicacies Rest areas lodging some existing some new and attractions will be marked on an app The less is more approach aims not to cover up the unpolished segments but to offer an honest experience In the U S you have Route Costa says It s not really about driving It s about the real America We have Route plus years But it s not America the Appia is competing with Costa isn t the first of the Appia s new designers to reveal that a quiet rivalry is brewing The Camino de Santiago Spain s saintly route typically attracts walkers and its destination Santiago de Compostela draws more than two million tourists annually From Rome to Brindisi the Appia is a secular journey through Italian history But done the other direction it trails St Paul as he traveled to Rome from Jerusalem Compared with the Camino de Santiago Costa says the nature is even better the history is times better And at the end you reach the pope The Appia s meaning for couples is the path they have to walk together says wedding photographer Angelo Corbi who has a studio along the route s stones in the village of Terracina What better than the Via Appia for that The town plaza has become a popular destination for weddings and Corbi ensures the Appia provides a historic backdrop II The start To follow the Appia I d hoped to start at its beginning I soon discover it hasn t been unearthed yet The first cobblestones are likely buried near what is now a traffic clogged roundabout at the center of Rome Today in an effort to locate them without halting the busy city the Ministry of Cultural Heritage has been digging out small deep strips of pavement so far unsuccessfully A few miles south is the Appia Antica Archaeological Park the best preserved and most walkable piece of the road Its path meanders from central Rome to the city s outskirts sprinkled on either side with some archaeological sites mosaic filled Roman villas a mazelike Christian catacomb with half a million dead and mausoleums of enslaved persons and ancient society girls alike Stop stranger one gravestone implores and look at this little mound of earth on the left where the bones of a good person are enclosed Modern life scrolls past elderly couples on sunset strolls and birthday partygoers on horseback tours Shepherds in small cars herd goats and sheep Diners fork into platters of roasted meats outside Qui Nun Se More Mai Here you never die a cozy trattoria atop the Appia The stones dip where two millennia of horse drawn carts carved deep grooves Niccolò Bassotti practices with his soccer team on Gerini Quadraro a field famously featured in the opening scene of filmmaker Federico Fellini s La Dolce Vita just a few yards from the ancient aqueducts in Rome Ruins of ancient Rome s essential aqueduct network are preserved in the Appia Antica park While tourists flood more famous sites in the capital city not many find their way a few miles south leaving locals to enjoy this green space Three friends picnic among the aqueducts The park s director has implemented a busy schedule of concerts movie screenings and heritage days that aim to attract both tourists and locals to the serene segment of the Appia as it leaves central Rome and heads to the countryside A late night customer savors a drink at Qui Nun Se More Mai a trattoria in Rome whose name means Here you will never die Its tables stand directly on the stones of the Appia But the typical tourist to Rome is on a sightseeing blitz staying only a few days before leaving for Florence or Venice Before COVID the archaeological park saw visitors a year Two miles north the Colosseum drew over seven million A new park director has installed an alluring schedule of concerts festivals and heritage days It appeared to be working on a warm fall day Parents picnicked in fields around a crumbled Roman stadium while children charged each other with fake gladiator swords There s a peacefulness to this park that makes it unlike any of Rome s other ancient attractions As the Appia s stones stretch away from the city the archaeological sites thin until only a lone column or statue stands among lush fields Stone pines with flat leafy tops offer shade and there are occasional historical markers and water fountains But once the path hits the McDonald s the Appia disappears III Walk through time To decipher the Appia s route beyond Rome I enlist the help of Riccardo Carnovalini the trekker who mapped it in We meet in the small city of Benevento at a restaurant in the plaza Carnovalini who is wears zip off hiking pants a fleece and new boots that already have clocked nearly miles We fill a table with deep fried zucchini flowers and cod stewed in tomato sauce Over a minty aperitif he quotes Italian author Italo Calvino who once wrote that a visited country must pass between the lips and down the esophagus When Carnovalini and author Paolo Rumiz first walked the Appia in their course ended up about miles longer than the original route Modernity had consumed much of the early path forcing them to navigate around highways and industrial zones Riccardo Carnovalini has crisscrossed Italy during his career as a walking guide and conservationist passing villages wind farms and agricultural lands In he charted the course of the ancient Appian Way and walked it with author Paolo Rumiz Now as the Italian government works to conserve the Appia he hopes people will begin to travel it and keep it relevant We are already miles from Rome but Carnovalini describes this area as the start of the many disagreements over the Appia s original path To make the modern route Carnovalini has studied maps street angles and building materials and chosen the most feasible option Even so pink and blue lines plotted on his GPS show the competing theories There are other walks he says as the waiters begin closing the restaurant for the night but they re for tourism This is not a walk it s history The next day we pass by overburdened tractors chugging through tobacco fields hills of spinning windmills and fields being devoured by controlled fires Carnovalini strolls effortlessly cracking hazelnuts and picking wine grapes from curling vines along the path The Appia has literally been absorbed by these sleepy villages its stones and columns embedded in walls and doorways On long stretches the red line on Carnovalini s GPS is the only indication we re still on the right track For long stretches in southern Italy the Appia is lost under modern pavement private land and fields of wheat such as these near the town of Palazzo San Gervasio The architects of the new walking route have designed small detours to avoid areas where the Appia is no longer walkable Short yellow paths indicate detours to keep walkers off major roads As an adviser to the Ministry of Cultural Heritage Carnovalini has mapped out dozens of these both to circumvent the route s impassable segments and to lead walkers to existing accommodations Walking the Appia I learn doesn t always mean walking on the Appia Carnovalini takes me on one detour through the charming hilltop village of Frigento where we descend into a Roman cistern and greet the town s free roaming resident peacocks IV Honest tourism The Ministry of Cultural Heritage has earmarked million euros million to develop the Appia for tourism but as I visit archaeological sites along the route it s clear more funds are being eagerly awaited Archaeologists spent excavating a yard stretch of Appian cobblestones in a town called Passo di Mirabella Today it s hidden under a large protective sheet Another phase of funding is necessary for the team to continue preserving their finds It s the same story across Italy where an economic dip has forced the national government to cut the cultural heritage budget every year for the past decade leading to the reburying of discovered sites The cash injection along the Appia s path is welcome but it s going to require sustained upkeep These regions tend to be overlooked archaeologists tell me When there s money one says it usually ends up in Pompeii and Herculaneum James Bond fans may recognize the Ponte dell Acquedotto near the Appia s path in Gravina in Puglia from s leap in No Time to Die Attracting film productions is one way southern Italy hopes to raise its economic prospects Trekkers hike out from Gravina in Puglia a walled city in southern Italy that s seeing a rise in tourism I m confident investing here because something great has to happen says Nunzio Matera a local banker who s restoring the ancient cellars of his house in hopes of opening a restaurant After Rome s Colosseum the amphitheater of Capua was the largest arena of the time The Appia originally linked Rome to this city which rivaled the capital in influence The process to romanize the Italian population happens through this street says Ida Gennarelli the site director of the Appia Not only did the military walk this street but so did ideas slaves and religions from the East A group called La Taricata performs an Italian folk dance in Mesagne the penultimate city along the Appian Way The dance is known as pizzica which was said to heal women from the venom of a tarantula a spider that held great power in southern Italian folklore Carnovalini had cautioned that a journey along the Appia is unique for its honesty The Appian experience is up and down he said In one moment you re saying Wow that s beautiful then you turn your head and say Wow that s horrible Italy he added is not a postcard That truth crystallizes as I approach Taranto a port city roughly miles from the Appia s end This is the only place where Carnovalini and Rumiz were forced to hail a taxi during their trek Before me is a six square mile expanse of industrial production This pollution belching steel plant the largest in Europe has turned Taranto into the trenches of Italy an Italian journalist warned me before I arrived The Appia runs alongside the factory and into an island that holds Taranto s old town It feels time has rewound years In tiny storefronts old men paint religious figurines to sell to the few tourists Fishing boats jostle for space along the boardwalk I am told that dolphins and whales are sometimes visible on the horizon Winding alleys lead to a cathedral dripping with marble Taranto instantly becomes my favorite spot along the Appia But above this mirage of old Italy black plumes billow from smokestacks The piers of Taranto are lined with fishing boats and its streets are an enchanting maze of small shops and restaurants But a neighboring steel processing plant has cast a shadow over the city and its inhabitants High cancer rates especially among children are attributed to the polluting plant We d like to dedicate our lives to the beauty of Taranto says Massimo Castellana a local activist Nevertheless we re forced to talk about something else children dying Taranto was the only city founded by the Spartans outside Greece and a row of Greek columns still stands near the water This is where I meet Massimo Castellana a member of an activist coalition fighting to close the factory On windy days when steel particles blow into town residents shut their windows and keep their kids home from school Studies have shown high levels of cancer here compared with the rest of Italy particularly among children Taranto should be known for its beauty Castellana says not its industry But despite years of protests the factory remains open Among the many hopes embedded in the revival of the Appia by people like Castellana is that harnessing history for tourism can reverse the fortunes of southern Italy which has long been stereotyped as old fashioned and crime ridden As I head from Taranto to Brindisi the Appia s end I stop in the once walled city of Mesagne where I meet Simonetta Dellomonaco head of the regional film commission who tells me her guiding adage Culture is the only fuel that doesn t pollute the more you consume When Dellomonaco was growing up Mesagne was known as the birthplace of Italy s fourth Mafia family the Sacra Corona Unita Today that image is being replaced by scenic Hollywood cameos including in the latest James Bond film As we speak actors playing Native Americans are riding through a nearby park that s posing as the American West And just outside town archaeologists have unearthed the last visible stretch of the Appia s original cobblestones Investing in its heritage landed Mesagne as a finalist for Italy s Capital of Culture They used to say every road leads to Rome Dellomonaco says But here the most important ends Photographer Andrea Frazzetta shot this long exposure photo of a church in Sanzanello on a moonless night lit by stars and the glow of the city A nearby necropolis was recently discovered during excavations along the Appian Way V End of the road Under the Romans Brindisi reached its biggest splendor a local guide is telling a small crowd gathered on the boardwalk in Brindisi They understood the importance of the port From Brindisi you could take off for the East It s Via Appia Day an annual celebration and the group is touring the route s end point on a sunny October afternoon Around B C the Romans arrived here defeated the Messapian civilization and completed the Appian Way The guide is climbing a tall set of stairs toward the columns that famously mark the end of the route The group gathers for a photo around a towering column and the base of its twin the rest was gifted to a neighboring city centuries ago These columns are commonly considered the end of the Appian Way she is saying But not everyone agrees Hold on The Appia s starting point was uncertain but the finale was always clear two columns framing the Adriatic Sea in Brindisi But analysis of the marble has revealed they were built two centuries later An archaeologist on the Appia s excavation warns me not to get too consumed with finding its end The Appia is chameleon like changing from street to route to highway more a system than a line We re chasing a myth he says What s important is that the Appia turned Brindisi into a global powerhouse from which the Roman Army set off to expand its empire east to cities like Alexandria and Jerusalem Eventually the Roman Empire ruled a quarter of the human population across three continents The Appia would have run to and perhaps through the gate to Brindisi before likely becoming the main street known in Roman times as the decumanus Two ornately carved columns were erected above the port of Brindisi and thought to mark the end of the Appian Way Today only one remains its mate was given to a neighboring city centuries ago Brindisi became a destination for Holy Land pilgrims who waited for weeks to board the next boat to Jerusalem Now a couple hundred travelers show up each year via various hiking routes that lead to the city Restoring Brindisi s reputation as a destination is the personal crusade of Rosy Barretta Barretta privately funds an organization that arranges visits for pilgrims called Brindisi and the Ancient Roads and her family runs a large tugboat company It was a waste that no one was taking care of this piece of engineering and inventiveness she says She imagines Brindisi once again filled with travelers tracing the Appia s path Podcast Sonic postcards from the Appian Way Listen Now In this episode of our podcast Overheard hear why the Appian Way in Italy is thought of as the OG superhighway Listen now on Apple Podcasts The morning after the tour she invites me to join her on a tugboat to see the port Skinny roads stretch out from the city into the sea creating a sheltering circle around Brindisi and giving it the appearance of having antlers The Alfonsino Castle sits on one of these horns surrounded by the Adriatic its stone walls glimmering in the sun Barretta dreams of transforming it into a national Appia museum She envisions its restored lighthouse beaming a spotlight miles over the water drawing in cruise ships and destination weddings We watch as a hulking ship approaches the port of Brindisi Our tugboat s captain a young Brindisi native named Alessandro di Giulio opens an app on his phone and tracks the boat back to its departure point in Mozambique It carries raw sugar he says which will be unloaded and processed locally The water is calm as two of Barretta s tugboats rush to greet the ship and begin to pull it into port Di Giulio tells me he recently moved back home after a decade abroad working for Carnival Cruises He saw the Middle East Africa and the Caribbean but always dreamed of returning to the port of Brindisi where ships have been unloading goods and passengers for thousands of years From my professional point of view he says it s the center of the world Staff writer Nina Strochlic last wrote about Maya beekeepers in Mexico Italian photographer Andrea Frazzetta
