to sailing trips around the pristine Whitsunday Islands and easy bike rides through the wine regions around Canberra the capital city Wander through fields of lights at Uluru Uluru has always been a drawcard for visitors but in the past decade this Northern Territory area has undergone an artistic transformation Collaborations between light artists and Aboriginal Anangu creatives have seen the desert turned into a luminous canvas featuring colour shifting fields of light Anangu stories etched into the sky using thousands of drones and since August an immersive sunrise show with a breakfast using native ingredients afterwards Sail the Whitsundays Hoist the sails on your own maritime adventure as you skipper a power boat catamaran or yacht to explore the Whitsunday Islands off the

landmass in the Tasman Sea off the New South Wales coast only permits visitors at a time Little is known about the shark s movements which is why scientists are recruiting the island s guests to help gather photographic data as part of a snorkelling citizen science project Under the supervision of a trained instructor slip into the island s warm waters and enjoy the experience of up to of these curious creatures gracefully circling you Cycle Canberra s wine regions Canberra s first vines were planted in the but local viticulture stagnated until the when enterprising scientists revived the

time sometimes for years but when it floods it explodes with colour and sound as thousands of waterbirds arrive from as far away as Japan and China to breed on the salty shores As the water evaporates microalgae release a pink pigment that gives the lake its signature hue The best way to appreciate the scale and drama of the lake is from the air with Wrightsair which runs charter flights from
