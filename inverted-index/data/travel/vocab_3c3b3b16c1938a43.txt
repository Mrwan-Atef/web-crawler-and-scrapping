transportive getaways Chamidae Ford Brekke Fletcher Ann Douglas Lott Laura Motta Mar min read Share Martha s Vineyard is a wonderfully accessible beach trip from New York City Allan Wood Photography Shutterstock Where Locals Go is our series featuring holiday destinations often overlooked by visitors but cherished by locals In this edition our NYC experts showcase their favorite holiday spots at home While those of us who live in New York City know there is no place like home we also know there is nothing like getting out of town even if just for the day It has long been a tradition for New Yorkers to flee to cooler temps in more relaxing destinations when tourists descend and the city starts to feel too small even for locals Here New York based editors share the beloved nearby escapes they return to every year Left Hydrangeas on Martha s Vineyard Ann Douglas Lott Lonely Planet Right Tall ships in Vineyard Haven Getty Images Panoramic Images Marthaâ s Vineyard For an idyllic coastal getaway Ann Douglas Lott Digital Editor Advertisement Every New Yorker has a go to close ish summer beach destination they dream about the rest of the year Marthaâ s Vineyard is so special because itâ s uniquely itself â almost no chains walkable towns with unique personalities all kinds of beaches to suit your vibe and undeniably gorgeous pink sunsets The best news Delta and JetBlue have insanely cheap direct flights from NYC if you book early enough Oh and letâ s talk about the incredibly fresh seafood My favorite bite here is hands down the lobster roll from The Net Result in Vineyard Haven taken to go for a secluded sunset picnic at Lambertâ s Cove Beach Honorable mentions go to the ice cream at The Scoop Shack in Edgartown and cocktails on Atlantic Restaurant â s waterfront deck Some beach recs South Beach has fun crowds and big waves while Lighthouse Beach is a more peaceful tanning spot You could go the Airbnb route theyâ re all over the island but if you prefer a hotel the historic Harbor View Hotel and The Charlotte Inn in Edgartown have that classic Marthaâ s Vineyard feel If youâ re basing yourself in Oak Bluffs most ferries dock here a room at the Oak Bluffs Inn is not far from the iconic colorful â gingerbread cottages â Left A dock on Lake George in Silver Bay Jon Bilous Shutterstock Right Lake George s colorful town Joice Brinkerhoff Shutterstock Lake George For unassuming lake town charm Chamidae Ford Digital Editor Lake George in the wide and beautiful Adirondacks region is a newer summer tradition in my life but I love it all the same My boyfriend grew up going to this lake every year and now I get the very lucky experience of tagging along Lake George feels like home to me as it holds the west coast charm of a massive shimmering oh so clear lake and towering trees to provide a respite on the hot days At miles long the lake spans a few areas but the kitschy town of Lake George Town and a few other nearby spots are where most stay The area maintains a timeless charm you canâ t help but find endearing Plus it is chock full of activities Take a tiki boat cruise with your friends who doesn t love a party on the lake play miniature golf at Pirateâ s Cove Adventure swim along the shores at Million Dollar Beach rent a paddleboard and blow some money at one of the arcades Unlike other popular NY getaways that can lean very glamorous Lake George feels wholesome and rustic If youâ re looking for your inner child it s probably here The area is not one for fine dining but spots like Gaslight and the Adirondack Pub and Brewery will hold you over Advertisement The Lodges at Cresthaven has all the amenities a family needs to enjoy a lake trip There are cabin style rooms a pool lake access and a lovely boathouse restaurant A more mid range option is Blue Lagoon Resort and its lakeside abodes Airbnb also has viable options for cozy stays Donâ t forget to buy a tacky graphic tee on your way out that says â Lake Life Livingâ before heading home Left Marina on Shelter Island Right Boats in the bay Jaclyn Vernace Shutterstock Shelter Island The Hamptons for people who hate the Hamptons Brekke Fletcher Senior Director of Content Iâ ve lived in New York City for years and there are two universal truths The city on a summer weekend is kind of amazing because itâ s empty The city on a summer weekend is a hellscape from which there is no escape I used to be more like a Now Iâ m a full fledged So where do I go Shelter Island situated between the North and South Forks of Long Island Itâ s about three hours from the city depending on lots of things I cannot control While itâ s not easy to get there it is very easy to be there If you have a car drive I canâ t no car but more on this later Or take the LIRR Long Island Railroad or Hampton Jitney to Greenport and then hop the ferry for which you need in cash to buy a token â make sure youâ ve got some one dollar bills No matter which camp youÊ re in car or carless the truth is once youâ re there youâ ll be happier with a car â pro tip for the carless rent one at JFK My dear friends bought a house there during the pandemic and because Iâ m basically a charwoman who cooks and cleans Iâ m a frequently invited guest JK they love me You can either rent a house for the week or book a room at one of the islandâ s charming hotels Itâ s summer in the Hamptons so itâ s not cheap If you can midweek it so much the better I love The Pridwin the most itâ s on Crescent Beach it has a pool a fantastic bar and restaurant a lovely spa and itâ s newly renovated The Chequit if youâ re not driving is a walkable option and so is the Shelter Island House When it comes to food expect to pay through the nose My favorite place to spend on a baby wheel of cheese is Marie Eifell I love their breakfast sandwiches on baguettes Grab a less fussy breakfast from Eccentric Bagel go for the Za atar For lunch Stars Cafe and The Islander are solid choices Watch the sunset with oysters and martinis at the Rams Head Inn or listen to live music in the afternoon at Shipwreck Bar For fancy ish dinner go to Leon or Vine Street Cafe For things to do there is a public golf course and there are outdoor massages at Crescent Beach Another great beach particularly for swimming is Wades which is not far from the Mashomack Preserve bring your bug spray and wear socks to guard against ticks Thereâ s also an adorable farmstand at Sylvester Manor And there is no place I love more than the islandâ s only grocery store the IGA Left Fall in the Hudson Valley Getty Images Right Tomatoes at a local farm stand Dan Hallman for Lonely Planet The Catskills For hikers shoppers and foodies Laura Motta The Catskills has to be NYCâ s worst kept secret We all love it and thereâ s nothing better than a summer escape It would be a crime not to give this area the recognition it deserves I spent some time there last year and itâ s exactly what I hoped for a change of scenery Every town in the Catskills has a unique charm and holds the promise of wonderful restaurants trendy bars and excellent shopping I love to stop by Subversive Malting Brewing for smash burgers quirky brews and a great outdoor space The postcard ready town of Hudson is another great stop too Shop for vintage clothes and records here or have afternoon tea Head to Spotty Dog for two of my favorite things â drinks and books â all under one roof For dinner try Swoon in Hudson which has mouthwatering steak and an upscale vibe Or if youÊ re open to a minute drive Silvia in Woodstock and its farm to table wood fired fare will forever live in my mind For an artsy excursion drive to Olana the historic and gorgeously eccentric home of painter Frederic Church It sits perched on a hill overlooking the Hudson and welcomes you as you cross into town on the Rip Van Winkle Bridge Not only is it super easy to get to the Catskills from NYC rent a car or hop an Amtrak train but there s a lot of nice lodging that s reinventing the idea of the cabin or deep woods getaway Hunter Lodge feels right for skiers and hikers but it s also great if you re pursuing lower impact sightseeing The Maker Hotel is more expensive but oh so stylish and located right in the heart of Hudson Left The Heurich House near Dupont Circle Jon Bilous Shutterstock Right The National Gallery of Art Shutterstock Washington DC For city lovers who want a little less city Ann Douglas Lott Digital Editor When you spend so much time in a city as big as NYC DC feels a bit more quaint But itâ s not actually quaint â thereâ s so much to do here Here s why I love making a couple of trips here every year aside from visiting friends From New York City Amtrak will get you here in hours If I book at least two months in advance it costs around each way And once youâ ve arrived getting around is very manageable The best things to do here are free The Smithsonian museums strolling around neighborhoods like Georgetown and Dupont visiting national monuments walking through Rock Creek Park â the list goes on Eating out here is so fun Balkan food from Ambar brunch in the back of Kramers bookstore Le Diplomate for a taste of French cafÃ culture and Call Your Mother for bagel sandwiches and latkes to call out a few As for museums youâ ve got the museums on the National Mall like the National Gallery the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Air and Space Museum But also venture beyond this area for others like the Phillips Collection the National Postal Museum and the National Museum of Women in the Arts Most importantly DCâ s museums are air conditioned making them a fabulous summer activity Or you can head to a Washington Nationals baseball game I usually stay with friends in Dupont Circle but youâ ve got plenty of stellar hotel options like the Lyle in Dupont Circle the Dupont Circle Hotel and the iconic downtown Willard InterContinental Hotel Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere
