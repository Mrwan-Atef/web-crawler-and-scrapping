you ll have great weather for your Colombia adventure FJ Jimenez Getty Images Colombia s equatorial position means temperatures fluctuate by altitude not the time of year so with the country s diversity of landscapes almost any time can be a good time to visit Advertisement These changes in altitude also mean Colombia has many microclimates and brief dry and wet seasons to factor in although most places experience little temperature variation between seasons Once you know where youâ d like to go in Colombia spend some time researching the weather in the area Hereâ s our guide to the best time to visit Colombia and experience the best the country has to offer The Parque Nacional Natural Tayrona offers wildlife and views streetflash Shutterstock December to February is ideal for hiking Colombia s national parks December to February is a fantastic time to travel through Colombia because itâ s dry everywhere except the Amazon In the Andes expect sunny skies and warmish days â perfect for hiking in the countryâ s clutch of outstanding national parks while the Caribbean coast is at its most gorgeous â and busiest It s a popular time to visit including for domestic travelers so prices are at their highest throughout the entire country Advance bookings for hotels and flights are essential particularly along the northern coast January is the perfect month for hiking in Colombia with trail conditions typically dry and the sky clear ensuring excellent views from the top of many of the countryâ s lofty peaks If you dislike crowds head to BogotÃ which is deserted thanks to residents hitting the coast for their vacations or go to a secluded eco lodge along the Pacific coast Advertisement The end of January is also ideal for exploring the Caribbean coast as the holiday crowds dissipate but the festivals and parties carry on Low humidity levels and warm temperatures make sunbathing and swimming an appealing prospect Cartagena and Santa Marta are extremely busy in the first few weeks of January Surfers will enjoy the big swells that bring waves to the beaches close to Barranquilla Santa Marta Cartagena and Parque Nacional Natural Tayrona A blue whale jumps off the coast of Juanchaco in the Colombian Pacific Sebastian Delgado C Shutterstock March to September the shoulder season is the best time for whale watching and adventure sports Check the weather carefully before booking a trip between March and September because the temperature and rainfall have massive regional variations BogotÃ MedellÃ n and Cali suffer a secondary rainy season in April and May while Cartagena shines through April with hard rains beginning in May July through August is another short dry season although you can expect brief tropical showers in highland cities For animal lovers the best time for whale watching on the Pacific coast is July to October Festivals around Easter are also a spectacle worth seeing Colombiaâ s Caribbean islands San AndrÃ s and Providencia remain dry until May so shoulder season is an opportunity to explore their glorious beaches and remarkable coral reefs Semana Santa Easter is big in Colombia Whether it falls in March or April the country is seriously tuned in with celebrations taking place in all of the main cities However crowds flock to those held in the handsome colonial era town of PopayÃ n where thousands spill out onto the cobbled streets and plazas to join solemn religious processions and costumed parades that have taken place every year since Mompox Pamplona and Tunja also hold colorful celebrations for Holy Week High water levels in March and into April mean the white water rafting in adventure capital San Gil is at its most thrilling and conditions are typically good for other adrenaline fueled activities including paragliding and caving Cumbia dancers with vivid dress in Cartagena celebration the day it declared independence from Spain WILLIAM RG Shutterstock Visit in October to November for cheap deals and wildlife spotting in the Amazon Across the country prices are at their lowest and itâ s a wonderful time to visit the Amazon where low water levels mean excellent hiking and wildlife spotting white sand beaches and fewer mosquitoes Elsewhere however flash floods often wash out roads in the Andean region and MedellÃ n Cartagena and the Caribbean coast are disproportionately wet in October â October and November are Colombia s rainiest months and BogotÃ Cali MedellÃ n and Cartagena are all at the mercy of the weather with rainfall mostly hitting in the afternoon so get out early to avoid the downpours Parque Nacional Natural Tayrona uses this period of peace and quiet to close listing those dates on its website So if you want pristine nature head instead to the Amazonas Department to the peaceful town of Puerto NariÃ o or busier Leticia for a thrilling jungle tour where water levels remain low and wildlife spotting chances high Although November is wet wet wet throughout Colombia head for the much warmer Caribbean coast The attractions here are the parties parades and other festivities that abound in Cartagena on the of the month when it celebrates the day it declared independence from Spain Expect to get deals on hotel prices and airfares in November too Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience
