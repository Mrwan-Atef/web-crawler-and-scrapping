the equator daytime temperatures hover at around C F all year so you won t have to worry too much about getting cold except in the hills That said it s worth considering how the two monsoon seasons affect different parts of the island before planning a trip though it s easy to hop across the island if you get your forecasts confused On most trips people mix up beach time with detours to national parks and trips to the cooler highlands and ancient cities in the middle of the island so you ll experience a mix of heat and cool on pretty much every visit And the Sri Lankan calendar is chock full of festivals and holidays offering a unique cultural highlight for visitors almost every month Whether youâ re looking to hit the beach spot wild elephants hike to the summit of Adamâ s Peak or simply

of the country Popular beach resorts such as Hikkaduwa and Mirissa are at their most idyllic but also busiest aligning with excellent surfing conditions on the south and west coasts However the Maha monsoon season October to January keeps the Eas t the North and the Ancient Cities humid and rainy at this time of year Sri Lanka is a year round wildlife watching destination but the best times to spot elephants leopards and buffalo is during the main November to April tourist season All the big parks are open and animals start to gather around water holes making them easier to spot However the island s greatest wildlife spectacle â the Gathering of elephants at Minneriya National Park â takes place from July to September By December high season is in full swing with bathers jostling for towel space on the beaches along the south and west coasts The pilgrimage season on Adamâ s Peak when pilgrims of all faiths climb the sacred summit starts in December and lasts until mid April Peak

times for treks to viewpoints in the Hill Country Mikhail Sotnikov Getty Images September to October and April are the best times for exploring the whole country Squeezed between the two monsoon seasons Sri Lankaâ s twin shoulder seasons see agreeable weather right across the country with fewer crowds and lower prices April however does coincide with the busy Sinhala and Tamil New Year which can cause transport troubles This is a good time for trekking in the Hill Country or climbing Sigiriya as the weather is mostly dry but not as hot as in the height of summer From August to September hundreds of elephants group together for several weeks in Minneriya National Park during the annual Gathering It s one of Asiaâ s great wildlife spectacles and you have a good chance of seeing baby elephants October can be a bit unpredictable with the summertime Yala monsoon fading and conditions building towards the Maha monsoon Thunderstorms can arrive in the afternoons and rain is common but there s still good surfing on the east coast Just add a raincoat to your list of things to pack After the busy winter season April is warm and dry across the majority of the country and prices fall as the peak season crowds depart Although Christians comprise only six percent of Sri Lankaâ s population Christian festivals â including Easter which usually falls in April â are still celebrated with gusto A more significant event in April is Avurudu the Sinhalese and Tamil New Year New Yearâ s Eve and New Yearâ s Day are official holidays and over the days before and after buses and trains are jammed as people flee from big cities to home villages The day Esala Perahera festival brings colorful festivities across Sri Lanka SamanWeeratunga Shutterstock May to August is the best time to avoid the crowds The low season in Sri Lanka starts with the arrival of the Yala monsoon in May which pounds the west and south coasts as well as the Hill Country until August Accommodation prices during this period are generally lower and crowds are thinner This is the best time for trips to Jaffna in the North and the chilled out resorts along the East Coast such as Arugam Bay known for its consistent point breaks and laid back surf scene Despite the rain many must see festivals take place during this period including Vesak Poya a two day festival in May when colored lights adorn every Buddhist home shop and temple There s also the vibrant Esala Perahera in Kandy where thousands of dancers and drummers form a giant procession through the town The rains dampen tourism in June except on the East Coast beaches which stay drier at this time Meanwhile another major Buddhist event the Poson Poya gets underway celebrating the introduction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka Major festivities take place in the temples of Anuradhapura and thousands of white clad pilgrims ascend the calf busting steps to Mihintaleâ s sacred stupa The Yala monsoon season sees major celebrations at religious sites such as Mihintale Jonathon Stokes for Lonely Planet For travelers who arenâ t easily disheartened by the odd downpour summer is a good time to be in Sri Lanka The focal point for the countryâ s Buddhists is Esala Perahera in July or August which lasts for days The Kandy Esala Perahera is legendary but smaller parades are held across Sri Lanka Many celebrations feature dancers drummers and stilt walkers who practice all year for the occasion Another large scale procession takes place in Colombo as part of the Hindu festival of Aadi Vel which sees the gilded chariot of Murugan Skanda the Hindu god of war ceremonially hauled through the cityâ s streets August marks the last month of low season with the Yala monsoon slowly beginning to ease To maximize the chance of avoiding the rain head north to Jaffna where the famous Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil hosts the spectacular Nallur Festival sometimes starting in July The event climaxes with parades of juggernaut floats and gruesome displays of self mortification by entranced devotees The sacred Sri Maha Bodhi tree is the oldest known human planted tree in the world Boyloso Shutterstock Poya full moon days It is worth noting that every poya full moon day is a holiday in Sri Lanka White clad pilgrims gather at Buddhist shrines and buses trains and accommodations fill up especially if the full moon falls on a Friday or Monday No alcohol is supposed to be sold on poya days and many bars close though some hotels discreetly provide cold beer under the table This is a particularly atmospheric time to visit the sacred Sri Maha Bodhi tree at Anuradhapura grown from a cutting taken from the tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Sri Lanka
