Feb min read Share Driving on Omanâ s wide network of roads is easy for visitors but off roading requires skill Â arabianEye Getty Images Oman â s stunning landscapes are this countryâ s marquee attractions And to truly appreciate the rose gold desert dunes trails crisscrossing mountainous terrain white sand beaches quiet fishing villages and rocky valleys with turquoise pools itâ s best to explore by car While Omanâ s public transportation system of buses and ferries will get you between the main cities and towns a private ride is recommended if you want to travel deeper in search of nature experiences such as hiking diving or snorkeling â likely to be the highlights of any trip here Advertisement In addition to accessing to remote areas around the country getting around in Oman by car gives you flexibility in your travel plans Thereâ s nothing like chancing upon an empty beach tucked away in a cove and spontaneously deciding to set your tent up under a starry night sky If you plan a road trip across Omanâ s different regions â from the desert landscapes of Al Buraimi in the northwest and coastal cities such as Muscat and Sur to fortified towns like Nizwa and Bahla in the interior and agricultural villages in the Hajar Mountains â youâ ll need at least a week Add another week to your itinerary if youâ re keen to drive to the beaches verdant wadis valleys and nature reserves of the Dhofar region in the south perhaps visiting a few islands along the way Hereâ s how to get around Oman during your visit Cut down travel time in Oman by plane Domestic flights are the best way to significantly reduce travel times between certain regions and avoid entire days of driving between them Oman Air operates flights between Muscat Duqm Salalah and Khasab and Oman based low cost airline Salam Air offers connections between Muscat Sohar and Salalah Tickets can be booked online Omanâ s network of roads is modern and easy to navigate for visitors Â Getty Images A car is the easiest most flexible way to see Oman Renting a car is undoubtedly the easiest way to travel around Oman giving you plenty of flexibility the best value for money and the ability to reach remote locations you wouldnâ t by other means Youâ ll also have the freedom to wild camp on public land just bring a tent food and sleeping bag Cars can be rented from international chains like Avis and Thrifty or local companies at a slightly lower rate using your International Driving License You can book your rental car in advance and pick it up at your arrival airport An extensive network of paved roads in good condition connects the main cities and regions In Oman vehicles are driven on the right hand side of the road most of the time lane discipline is maintained and traffic rules are respected While driving in Muscat isnâ t as nerve wracking as in Dubai in the neighboring United Arab Emirates if you find yourself being tailgated itâ s best to move to the next lane and let the car pass Road signs are written in both English and Arabic Speed limits are h on highways h on rural roads and h in residential areas all roads are monitored through radars and speed cameras Although you can navigate using Google Maps the Waze app is more accurate There are plenty of gas stations with stores and toilets along the main routes Between November and March there can be days of heavy rainfall around the country accompanied by thunderstorms and strong winds On such days road conditions are not ideal for driving in Muscat for example roads can get waterlogged and some areas can get flooded leading to traffic congestion Since seas can be rough during such times itâ s best not to camp along the coast When planning a road trip around Oman keep an eye on the weather and check the official website of the Directorate General of Meteorology for any warnings concerning flash floods sandstorms and tropical cyclones Advertisement If you plan on driving around in desert terrain or mountainous regions like Jebel Akhdar where you can expect steep graded and dirt roads between villages and wadis itâ s sensible to rent a vehicle suitable for off roading Do not wander off existing tracks Off roading requires skill common sense and a good presence of mind Itâ s wise to carry a long tow rope traction mat and shovel should your vehicle get bogged down somewhere Ensure you always have enough water and some food in your car In Oman itâ s not uncommon to see cars ill equipped for the rugged terrain of the mountains and desert dunes break down or get stuck in the sand Generally Omanis are helpful should you find yourself in such a sticky situation someone passing by will almost always stop to help In remote areas however you might not have such luck When driving outside of the cities keep an eye out for wandering camels and mountain goats Flash floods can occur in the wadis just after it has rained and it can be tricky to get out of overflowing wadis Check the weather forecast and warnings before you set out Beware of driving on sabkha a salt flat that seems like itâ s solid and therefore easy to drive on only until you get stuck this is not recommended for inexperienced drivers Pay attention to signs warning visitors and avoid venturing farther Be careful for wandering camels when driving through Oman Â Beata Nowik EyeEm Getty Images Hailing a taxi in Oman Youâ ll find privately owned orange and white taxis in Muscat and other cities outside shopping malls hotels and tourist attractions these are safe well maintained and comfortable Theyâ re also unmetered so fares must be negotiated before you get in but will almost always be cheaper than the alternative The relatively newer metered government operated Mwasalat taxis in a red and white livery are another option In Muscat English is spoken and drivers will be familiar with popular landmarks and tourist sights otherwise show them the location on a map on your smartphone Itâ s also possible to hire a private taxi to travel between cities or for an entire day â ask the driver about fare and availability While Uber Careem and Lyft are not available in Oman local smartphone apps include Oman Taxi Otaxi and Marhaba Oman taxi the latter is slightly pricier Both let you select your pick up and drop off locations on a map connect you to the nearest driver and indicate approximate fares As per the unspoken rules of culture women traveling alone are advised to sit in the rear seat directly behind rather than across from the driverâ s side Budget travelers should consider the bus The government owned Mwasalat operates public buses within Muscat and Salalah as well as a network of intercity and inter regional buses and ferries across Oman including connections between Muscat and Nizwa Duqm Bahla Sur Buraimi Masirah Island Salalah and Khasab Visitors can consult daily schedules routes and tariffs on the networkâ s website Tickets are affordable â fares range from US to US â and can be bought on board The Mwasalat smartphone app is useful for its journey planner and interactive map The buses are clean comfortable safe and air conditioned For travelers on a budget buses offer the cheapest mode of transportation both within cities and between them Boats ferry passengers between mainland Oman and coastal islands and can also be chartered for snorkeling excursions Â Andrew Montgomery Lonely Planet Explore the coastal islands by boat Ferry services from the mainland make it possible to visit Omanâ s coastal islands where youâ ll find dive sites thriving with marine life nature reserves and pristine beaches Mwasalat operates a ferry service between Masirah Island and Shannah Port on the southeastern coast and also runs a bus from Muscat to Shannah Port The journey to Hilf the main town on Masirah Island takes an hour Cars can be transported on the ferry A ferry service also connects Shinas in northern Oman reachable via bus from Muscat to the ports of Khasab Dibba and Lima on the Musandam Peninsula You can check ferry routes schedules and tariffs and book tickets on the official National Ferries Company NFC website Water taxis are the most convenient way to travel between the marinas at Al Mouj and Bandar Al Rowdha in Muscat and Jebel Sifah Marina on the east coast The most straightforward way to reach the Daymaniyat Islands is with local operators like SeaOman which organizes catamaran and powerboat trips to the islands as well as diving snorkeling and other water sports from Al Mouj Marina in Muscat and other locations along the coast Theyâ ll also arrange all the permits needed to visit these islands If you find yourself in a coastal town and want to explore nearby villages or islands such as those close to Al Sawadi itâ s possible to rent one of the private boats from local operators and fishermen either for the day or to be dropped off and then picked up at a specific time Accessible transportation in Oman Most Mwasalat buses are wheelchair accessible with low floors and extendable ramps The NFC ferries to Masirah Island and Musandam are also wheelchair accessible For road travel it is more convenient to rent an accessible vehicle with a hired driver from a private operator than from a rental company In Muscat and other cities newer and international hotels shopping malls tourist sights marinas some beaches and retail districts are accessible In some locations there are designated parking spaces reserved for people with disabilities Youâ ll find more information and tips on our accessible travel
