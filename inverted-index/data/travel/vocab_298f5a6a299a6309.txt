Disabilities Act ADA you can expect ample measures to make cruising easier for passengers with many kinds of disabilities However older ships that were built before the ADA may lack some of these enhancements Auxiliary aids such as flashers for the hearing impaired and buzzers for visually impaired passengers are often available on request All ship elevators have raised Braille signage and even some passageway handrails feature directions in Braille at regular intervals When evaluating a cruise passengers with mobility issues ranging from use of a cane or walker to complete dependence on a wheelchair should pay particular attention not only to the facilities on board their chosen vessel but also to the conditions they are likely to find in ports of call and on shore excursions Outside of the United States and in historical areas some accommodations may not be possible If you need special equipment such as portable oxygen or a wheelchair make sure to make your own provisions Ships don t typically carry these items While some ships will carry wheelchairs for injured passengers they can t usually be taken off ship More than the usual amount of planning is necessary for smooth sailing Cruise lines allow service animals but ports may not All cruise lines have some wheelchair accessible staterooms Steep gangways and tenders can prevent passengers in wheelchairs from going ashore in some ports Service animals may not be allowed in all areas of ships A few public areas may not be wheelchair accessible Passengers who need oxygen must make their own arrangements
