Scotland s second city celebrates bold international cuisine from Punjabi samosas to seasonal agnolotti By Robbie Armstrong April This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Glasgow s food scene like its denizens is convivial generous and bold While the city s fine dining restaurants once lived in the shadow of Scotland s capital today Glasgow is home to Michelin starred opulence stripped back Mediterranean modernism and cheap eats alike You can sample everything from ornate plated curries and kebabs cooked over coals seek out Kurdish falafel award winning lamb shawarma or Punjabi thali and choose between vegan tacos regional Chinese cuisine and some bright contemporary Scottish fare Come for the food stay for the atmosphere S ylvan smoked tomatoes with yogurt chilli butter Glasgow has no shortage of vegetarian restaurants and this is one of the best with an impressive low intervention wine list and a menu of small plates that s every bit as inspired riffing on both Middle Eastern and pan Asian influences A deceptively simple dish of smoked tomatoes roasted just so sits pleasingly upon yoghurt drizzled with chilli butter Sprouts with pickled chillies and aubergines in a hot and sweet sauce are also a must Celentano s ricotta agnolotti Much of Celentano s menu including the sourdough pickles and vermouth is made on site and this stuffed pasta dish is emblematic of the restaurant s Italian inspired seasonal minimal waste ethos The agnolotti are plump with fresh ricotta made using milk from Ayrshire s Mossgiel Organic Farm and served with tender purple sprouting broccoli and toasted sourdough breadcrumbs Husband and wife duo Anna and Dean Parker lead the venue from within the baronial grandeur of the Cathedral House hotel G loriosa paccheri with pork fennel ragu Scottish chef proprietor Rosie Healey formerly of now closed Alchemilla in Finnieston as well as London s Ottolenghi Padella and Rochelle Canteen helms the Mediterranean inspired kitchen at Gloriosa Here she whips up dishes defined by rusticity and finesse such as al dente tubes of paccheri pasta in a rich pork and fennel ragu topped with olive oil and parmesan The focaccia all golden crust and chewy interior is the most delicious vehicle with which to scoop up the sauce R anjit s Kitchen samosa channa special The samosas served at this bustling Southside spot are some of Glasgow s best Crisp triangles of fresh pastry burnished in the fryer give way to soft cushions of potato inside with a jolt of green chilli to awaken the senses They re the perfect foil for a side of chickpea and paneer curry in a mellow moreish sauce The tamarind chutney and fresh mint yoghurt is like everything made fresh daily by Ranjit Kaur and team The vegetarian kitchen channels the spirit of Sikh langar community dining offering affordable food showcasing the bold flavours of the Punjab The Real Wan geda chunky noodles Much to do with the Real Wan is unassuming The food is anything but A tiny kitchen produces everything from noodles to fermented chilli sauces and oils made by chef Lea Wu who champions the cuisine of her native Guiyang in southwest China The geda noodles are thick authentically irregular shaped and al dente and come in a heady tangy garlic sauce with smoky beef ragu or spicy aubergine Guizhou like neighbouring Szechuan and Hunan is a province famed for its tongue numbing flavours and Lea s spicy sour noodles certainly live up to this Shawarma King lamb shawarma DÃ¶ner is really famous in the UK but now shawarma is taking its place sorry Shawarma King s owner Majed Badrekhan says The Springfield Quay branch is one of the most decorated kebab houses Scotland has to offer including top spot at the British Kebab Awards in and Lamb for the shawarma is marinated a day in advance then built into a tower over the course of two laborious hours The flatbread wraps are rolled out fresh then cooked in the tandoor over coals blistering the dough and finishing it with more than a lick of smoke The salads sauces and pickles are made fresh an attention to detail that ensures this takeaway spot stands out in a crowded market Published in
