with a Civil Vero Beach Tranquil and picturesque this upscale Indian River County town has a strong commitment to the environment and culture and it s also home to eclectic galleries Jacksonville

retreat with a small settlement of Japanese farmers Delray has grown into a sophisticated beach town Delray s current popularity is caused in Jupiter and Vicinity Jupiter is one of the few towns in the region not fronted by an island but still quite close to the fantastic hotels shopping and Bradenton In Hernando de Soto landed near this Manatee River city which has some miles of beaches Bradenton is well situated for access to Boca Raton Less than an hour south of Palm Beach and anchoring the county s south end upscale Boca Raton has much in common with its fabled cousin Pensacola Beach Connected to Pensacola by two long bridges the island offers both a Gulf front and sound side for those seeking a calmer seaside experience Public Stuart and Jensen Beach The compact town of Stuart lies on a peninsula that juts out into the St Lucie River off the Indian River and has a remarkable Cocoa Beach After crossing a long and high bridge just east of Cocoa Village you drop down upon a barrier island A few miles farther and you ll Hollywood Hollywood has had several face lifts to shed its old school image but there s still something delightfully retro about the city New shops restaurants and art galleries Gainesville The University of Florida UF anchors this sprawling town Visitors are mostly Gator football fans and parents of students so the styles and costs of Marco Island High rises dominate part of the shores of Marco Island which is connected to the mainland by two bridges Yet because of its distance from downtown Sanibel and Captiva Islands Sanibel Island is famous as one of the world s best shelling grounds a function of the unusual east west orientation of the island s south end Just New Smyrna Beach The long dune lined beach of this small town abuts the Canaveral National Seashore Behind the dunes sit beach houses small motels and an occasional high rise Estero Bonita Springs Towns below Fort Myers have started to flow seamlessly into one another
