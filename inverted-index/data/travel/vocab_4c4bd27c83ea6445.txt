cultural insights You ll want more time in Paris than you think A glimpse of Paris can be caught in just a couple of days but to truly experience this busy city s diverse activities sights and experiences five days to a week is ideal Paris can be enchanting year round yet it s worth noting that August is the traditional holiday period in France which might mean the city s a lot sleepier than other times of the year Advertisement Sculptures in the Marly Court of the Louvre Museum Sylvain Sonnet Getty Images Book main attractions in advance With limited time pinpoint in advance the main attractions you want to visit Booking online for museums exhibitions or theater performances will save you a lot of time waiting in lines Remember Parisians enjoy their museums as much as tourists do so visiting on weekdays and starting early can significantly change your experience of busy landmarks Leave some time to wander If youâ re comfortable leaving part of your time in Paris without a firm itinerary stroll until you find yourself surprisingly lost It will allow you to discover the unique identity of each arrondissement district which is shaped by various layers of history With most landmarks concentrated in the city center it s easy to wander and never get bored In fact there s even a French word for this approach to experiencing a place flÃ ner Traverse from the upscale Champs Ã lysÃ es to the tourist packed St Michel then to the trendy Le Marais and the more bohemian Belleville all within the city s boundaries though you may not realize it For deeper insights consider themed tours food culture history street art architecture etc Many Parisians are eager to share their city with visitors and itâ s a great way to get first hand insider tips Dress like a Parisian Wear something comfortable Paris is a walking city While dark clothes will generally help you blend in with the Parisians and deter pickpockets if you like bright colors or dressier clothes that works too This is the home of couture after all Personal space is important More important â if you wish to blend in â be mindful of personal space especially on public transportation The golden rule when navigating Paris particularly on the Metro and RER suburban train network is to be unobtrusive Advertisement During busy times especially at rush hour from to and to put your backpack or luggage down and avoid using fold down seats When the carriage is full it s better to wait a few minutes for the next train Always keep to the right on corridors and escalators and have your ticket or Navigo travel pass handy for frequent ticket barriers and control Au Vieux Paris d Arcole restaurant on Rue Chanoinesse in the heart of Paris Victor Kiev Shutterstock Get familiar with cafÃ culture etiquette The best places to experience Paris and its people are at cafÃ s Take a moment to rest on a terrasse â cafe tables on the street â to people watch while planning the next part of your day Just grab a table and seat yourself servers will come and attend to you Bills are often left with the order on the table but payment isn t expected immediately unless explicitly stated Tipping isn t required but is always appreciated It s not uncommon to exchange a few words with people at neighboring tables but it s equally normal and acceptable to keep to oneself despite the proximity of seating as most establishments maximize their use of pavement space Smoking tobacco is widespread in France particularly at outdoor cafÃ s Indoor smoking is prohibited by law so if you re wondering whether smoking is allowed look for ashtrays on the tables Additionally Parisians generally value discretion so loud voices might attract disapproving looks Try and speak French even a little If you re lost or need directions don t hesitate to ask a local Despite the hustle Parisians will generally stop to help and most can provide basic directions in English The phrase Excusez moi parlez vous anglais Excuse me do you speak English is the best way to get someone s attention It s also polite to greet and say farewell bonjour during the day bonsoir at night and au revoir as you re leaving to anyone with whom you interact such as shopkeepers and hotel staff Should you befriend locals donâ t be surprised to see them make a move towards your cheeks La bise â giving kisses on the cheeks two in Paris â is the most common greeting among friends including between men However as a foreigner you wonâ t be expected to do it spontaneously Bus and tram services are more accessible than the Metro The few Metro stations that have elevators are indicated on Metro maps Wheelchair users or those traveling with a stroller may find it easier to travel by bus or tram as they are more spacious at street level and are usually equipped with ramps Always keep an eye on your belongings Wherever you go watch out for your personal belongings as pickpocketing is a risk on the Metro and near popular tourist sites Scammers may approach you with a petition to sign or items for sale distracting you from a potential pickpocket accomplice A lost jewel or banknote on the street is another distraction scam In some tourist areas you might encounter people trying to place a bracelet on your wrist and then demand payment In all cases politely decline any unsolicited interaction and walk away Souvenirs sold by street vendors including plastic souvenirs at the bottom of the Eiffel Tower are often significantly overpriced compared to those in shops A street in Paris Montmartre district with small cafes restaurants and art galleries Marina Da Shutterstock Crossing roads can be complicated Some roads in Paris are shared and cars taxis delivery trucks bikes scooters motorbikes skaters and pedestrians are expected to coexist in busy spaces Although the French drive on the right be aware that bicycles and scooters may use dedicated lanes that sometimes run counter to the traffic direction or merge with pedestrian walkways They re not always visible so watch out in all directions before stepping into the road Paris is generally a safe city Fortunately Paris is a safe city overall In localized areas in the northeast of Paris there can be occasional criminal activity typically at night As a tourist you re unlikely to be targeted for violent crimes based on race or origin especially when sticking to central attractions If you need transportation late at night when the Metro isn t running it stops between midnight and on weekdays and from on weekends it s safest to call a taxi or use a ride hailing app Paris is welcoming and LGBTIQ friendly Le Marais is one of the historic â gayborhoodsâ in Paris Unfortunately catcalling towards women can happen on the streets or on public transportation despite efforts in raising awareness Take reasonable precautions as you would in any big city watch out for potentially aggressive behavior â particularly from individuals who may be intoxicated or disoriented â on the Metro or in the streets Every district has its own central police station As is the case anywhere things sometimes go wrong If you run into a situation where you need police help look for the closest police station Every arrondissement has its own central office open at all times Alternatively dial the European emergency number For the fire department dial The standard of medical care is high Should you need medical assistance Paris has the largest operating public hospital system in Europe with emergency rooms equipped to receive travelers In case of emergency dial for the ambulance service Over the counter medicines can be found at pharmacies which are on almost every street in Paris with English speaking staff around tourist areas A mapping app
