Charles Usher Feb min read Share Taking a road trip in South Korea is a great way to see another side to the country Â Henn Photography Getty Images South Korea might not leap out as the obvious place for a road trip The country s superb public transportation means a private vehicle is rarely necessary and the traffic in Seoul can make you question the point of the open road when you spend so much time at a standstill But renting a car and escaping the capital opens up some otherwise inaccessible or at least more time consuming travel possibilities and gives you a chance to savor the charms of Korea s smaller cities and rural hamlets With well maintained roads and abundant signage just about the only thing you ll have to worry about is choosing where to go next Here are some of the best road trips in Korea for natural vistas history food and off the beaten path exploration The grand Korean tour Best road trip for a bit of everything Seoulâ Busan miles allow days Advertisement Sure

and a vibrant cultural scene await A drive close to the border with North Korea is a fascinating glimpse of a frozen conflict Â georgeclerk Getty Images Tracing the DMZ Best road trip for understanding Korea s recent history Incheonâ Sokcho miles allow days Actually visiting North Korea can be a difficult trip to pull off but this road trip in the south gets you close enough to peer into this hermitic country and provides an up close look at the consequences of the peninsula s tragic division The irony is that this trip is one of South Korea s most peaceful drives full of rice paddies and quiet farmsteads but look closely and you ll notice barbed wire and tank traps on the roadside Start in Incheon where a hillside memorial commemorates the Korean War s most consequential

Cheorwon Hwacheon and Inje â all claimed by North Korea before the war â where battlefields old barracks and even the shell of a local Workers Party of Korea Building recall the not so distant past

of vacationing Seoulites if you try to drive out of the capital on a Friday night or Saturday morning or into town on a Sunday night Avoid these times if you can South Korean highways have a toll system called Hi Pass which is administered without drivers having to stop When renting a car make sure that it comes with a Hi Pass transceiver You may still have to pay the tolls but at least this way you can do so when you return the car and avoid an annoying bill later on South Korea s highway rest stops called hyugeso are a national treasure Uniformly large spotless and fitted out with facilities such as cafeterias and scenic overlooks they re terrific places to take a break and chow down on snacks such as hodu gwaja small cakes with walnuts and red bean paste inside Google Maps likely won t work for navigation in South Korea Instead download and use the domestic KakaoMap app Motorcycles aren t allowed on major highways in Korea so if you switch your vehicle type to motorcycle menu settings car navigation vehicle type the app will keep you on the more scenic backroads Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real South Korea Let
