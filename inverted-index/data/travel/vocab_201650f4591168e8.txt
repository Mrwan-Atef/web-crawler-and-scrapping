Skyline of Brno city Matyas Rehak Shutterstock The storybook mystique and historic beauty of Prague is well known but there is more to Czechia â or the Czech Republic â for travelers with time to explore Most visitors come to Prague and Czechia in summer from June through August and itâ s not hard to see why The days are long in late June it stays light until the weather is sunny and just about everything a visitor might want to do is open Prague though can get uncomfortably crowded during the high season Add in the potential for a midsummer heat wave and you have the ingredients for a less than optimal stay For this reason weâ d suggest traveling in spring or autumn when the crowds are lighter and the temperatures are cooler September and May are two of the best months to visit offering pleasant weather and fewer tourists Advertisement For budget conscious travelers take note that January and February are the cheapest months to visit due to the colder weather and lower occupancy rates Bear in mind that some attractions like castles and museums particularly in smaller towns shut from October to April For those looking to explore beyond the capital a week to ten days is ideal for experiencing both Prague and the countryâ s scenic towns historic sites and national parks If time is limited a shorter visit of four to five days can still offer a solid introduction to Czechiaâ s highlights City center of Karlovy Vary in autumn Shutterstock September to November is best for fall foliage and food festivals September is the best month to travel when the weather is still warm but the crowds have evaporated Average temperatures in Prague range from C F in September cooling to C F by November Mushroom pickers head to the woods in early fall while hikers take advantage of crisp clear days October is arguably the best time to hit the Czech Switzerland trails as the forests take on a vibrant mix of reds oranges and yellows However itâ s important to be prepared for the possibility of an early winter in the higher elevation areas like the KrkonoÅ e and JesenÃ ky Mountains where snowfall can arrive as early as late September Early autumn often brings the season s first snowfall to mountainous parts of the country In September wine festivals are in full swing with notable events like Czechiaâ s premier Znojmo Wine Festival in South Moravia and PÃ lavskÃ vinobranÃ in Mikulov both celebrating the regionsâ long standing winemaking traditions Additionally Prague Burgerfest held at the city s tÄ exhibition grounds stands out as one of Prague s most popular food festivals If craft beer is more your thing head to Plzen for the Pilsner Fest a city beer festival that takes place in October As autumn progresses the seasonâ s flavors take center stage St Martin s Day on November is a tradition marked by the arrival of young wine and a feast of roast goose particularly in Moravian wine regions and Pragueâ s traditional restaurants Ä Krumlov has a lull in November making it the best month to visit While rain is fairly common in autumn misty days enhance the townâ s medieval charm especially when strolling its winding streets or ducking into a cozy cafe Canoeing in the River Vltava Ä Krumlov Yasemin Olgunoz Berber Shutterstock March to May is best for blooms and outdoor activities Spring truly is a glorious season in Prague and around the country By March temperatures begin to warm and by April Czechia s parks and gardens burst into life with pink and yellow blossoms Daytime highs range from C F in March climbing to C F by May Advertisement One of the seasonâ s more unusual traditions is Burning of the Witches PÃ lenÃ Ä arodÄ jnic celebrated on April This centuries old ritual has pagan origins and marks the transition from winter to spring Communities across the country gather to light bonfires symbolizing the burning away of winterâ s darkness while enjoying food music and festivities In Prague large bonfires are lit in parks such as Ladronka and Kampa drawing crowds for a lively night of celebration Musical events also thrive in spring The Prague Spring International Music Festival is the undisputed high point of the cultural calendar opening with a rousing rendition of MÃ vlast My Country by Czech composer BedÅ ich Smetana Thereâ s also The Festival of Songs in Olomouc a five day celebration of choral music which takes place in May or June Spring is also the perfect time to enjoy Pragueâ s outdoor spaces Pragueâ s PetÅ Ã n Hill is a favorite destination in April and early May when its cherry blossoms are in full bloom creating a dreamy pink canopy over the park Outside the city Czech Switzerland Ä eskÃ Å is a real treat for hikers in late spring when the trails are dry and the landscapes are lush and green For those looking to enjoy the cityâ s emerging warmth KarlÃ nâ s riverfront has become a hotspot for outdoor dining and drinks in the spring and summer As the season progresses Pragueâ s beer gardens come alive with PÅ Ã stav being a favorite open air spot along the river With lower prices fewer crowds vibrant festivals and stunning nature spring in the Czech Republic offers the best of both worlds Letna park in Prague in winter kaprik Shutterstock December to February is best for budget travel and winter charm Prices for lodging in Prague drop considerably during the colder months from November through March â except for the busy Christmas New Year and Easter holidays Temperatures in Prague range from to C F in November dropping to to C F in January and February Winter here can be magical with Christmas markets starting in late November mulled wine and a quieter mood after New Year Wandering Pragueâ s historic streets on a snowy winter Wednesday with twinkling seasonal decorations and cozy cafes offering respite from the cold must be one of the most magical experiences in Czechia Cold blustery days mean tourists and locals alike spend more evenings cozying up in quintessential Czech pubs essentially the countryâ s collective living room where people gather to meet friends catch up on news and enjoy a meal Winter is also a great time to explore Pragueâ s StarÃ MÄ sto Old Town where landmarks like the Old Town Hall Astronomical Clock and Church of Our Lady Before feel even more atmospheric under a dusting of snow The historic squares take on a romantic winter glow and the Christmas market at the Church of Saint Ludmila in Vinohrady rivals the more famous one in Old Town Square with fewer crowds Looking to get active While Czechia may not be the first place most think of when they are looking for a winter sports destination this largely mountainous country has lots of under the radar snow fun especially for cross country skiing and snowshoeing The KrkonoÅ e Mountains in North Bohemia are home to popular ski resorts like Å pindlerÅ v Pec pod SnÄ and Harrachov while quieter options include KlÃ novec in the KruÅ nÃ Mountains Å piÄ Ã k and Zadov in Å umava and DeÅ tnÃ in the OrlickÃ Mountains Cross country skiing snowshoeing and winter hiking have grown in popularity with well maintained trails in the JizerskÃ Mountains the
