Share The town of Vernazza Cinque Terre Louie Lea Shutterstock Home to some of the planet s greatest artworks historical monuments and food â and with the kind of varied landscapes that you often have to cross continents to see â Italy elates inspires and moves its visitors like few other countries Given Italy s art and architecture stuffed cities to its astonishing diversity of natural landscapes â dramatic coastlines serene lakes pristine mountains and those famous rolling hills â picking just a handful of destinations to visit in this wonderful country is not easy Planning your trip all depends on what youâ re looking for in your Italian odyssey whether thatâ s history art beaches hiking or even food No matter your passion our list of must see places in Italy should be your starting point Rome Best for history Once caput mundi capital of the world Rome was legendarily spawned by a wolf suckled boy developed into a vast empire rooted itself as the home of the Catholic church and is now the repository of more than two millennia of art and architecture Rome should definitely be the centerpiece of your trip if youâ re going to Italy for the first time but there s simply too much to see in one visit from the Pantheon and the Colosseum to Michelangelo s Sistine Chapel and countless works by Caravaggio Do as countless others have before you toss a coin into the Trevi Fountain and promise to return Planning tip Thereâ s an overwhelming amount to see here and with limited public transport in the city center your choice of hotel can be crucial Map out the sights youâ re most interested in before you book â if you want to be at the Vatican at opening time for example don t stay near the Colosseum The public markets at Campo Di Fiori Square in Rome Shutterstock Tuscany Best for a Renaissance fix From Botticelliâ s Venus emerging coyly from the water in the Uffizi Gallery to the mind boggling dome of its cathedral Florence is a feast for the eyes This was of course the seat of the Renaissance and there are knock out names at every turn â Michelangelo in the Accademia Donatello in the Bargello Leonardo and Raphael in the Uffizi Further afield in Tuscany â Italy s most romanticized region â is an undulating landscape of sinuous cypress trees olive groves and coveted regional treasures Glory in the Gothic majesty of Siena and the Manhattan esque skyline of medieval San Gimignano before exploring the vineyards of Italy s most famous wine region Chianti and the rolling cypress studded hills of the Val dâ Orcia Planning tip Youâ re best off without a car if youâ re sticking to major towns and cities since Tuscany has a good rail network But if you want to explore the countryside youâ ll definitely need a car The Dolomites Best for dramatic mountains Scour the globe and you ll find plenty of taller bigger and more geologically volatile mountains but few can match the romance of the pink hued granite Dolomites Maybe it s their harsh jagged summits the vibrant skirts of spring wildflowers or the rich cache of Ladin legends Then again it could just be the magnetic draw of money style and glamour at Italy s most fabled ski resort Cortina d Ampezzo or the linguistic curiosity of picture postcard mountain village Sappada Whatever the reason this tiny pocket of northern Italy takes seduction to dizzying heights Dockside along the Amalfi Coast Shutterstock Amalfi Coast Best for classic beauty Italy s most celebrated coastline is a gripping strip coastal mountains plunge into the piercing blue sea in a prime time vertical scene of precipitous crags sun bleached villages and cliffs rearing up behind Between sea and sky mountaintop hiking trails deliver Tyrrhenian panoramas fit for a god While some may argue that the peninsula s most beautiful coast is Liguria s Cinque Terre or Calabria s Costa Viola it is the Amalfi Coast that has seduced and inspired countless greats from Tennessee Williams and D H Lawrence to Elizabeth Taylor Virginia Woolf and Jackie Kennedy Of course its staggeringly romantic looks also make it one of the best places in Italy for couples Planning tip Yes driving along the Amalfi Coast is one of the worldâ s most famous road trips but often it feels like everyone else on the planet has the same idea Traffic can be nose to tail and parking is effectively nonexistent Instead take the ferry between towns or travel by public transport Pompeii Best for stepping back in time Frozen in its death throes the time warped ruins of Pompeii hurtle you years into the past Wander through chariot grooved Roman streets lavishly frescoed villas and bathhouses food stores and markets theaters and even an ancient brothel The best way to stay connected Saily provides a hassle free solution to travel data â just choose your data plan and prepare for your trip When you get to your destination you can go online right away Get your eSIM Then in the eerie stillness your eye on ominous Mt Vesuvius ponder Pliny the Younger s terrifying account of the town s final hours â Darkness came on again again ashes thick and heavy We got up repeatedly to shake these off otherwise we would have been buried and crushed by the weight â Planning tip If you have time the other major city destroyed by the eruption Herculaneum is also worth a visit Much smaller than Pompeii its buildings are better preserved and the location â surrounded by its modern descendant Ercolano â makes the site even more piquant Like Pompeii itâ s easily reached on the Circumvesuviana train Rolling hills and vineyards of Modena in Emilia Romagna Italy Stefano Termanini Shutterstock Emilia Romagna Best for foodies In a region as overwhelmingly foodie as Emilia Romagna it s fitting that its capital Bologna is dubbed â La Grassaâ the fat one Many belt busting Italian classics hail from here including mortadella tortellini and tagliatelle al Shop in the deli packed Quadrilatero district â home to food stalls since medieval times â then hop on the train for an afternoon in Modena for world famous aged balsamic vinegar Leave room for Parma hometown of parmigiano reggiano cheese and the incomparable prosciutto di Parma Wherever you plunge your fork toast with a glass or three of Emilia Romagna s renowned Lambrusco â a world away from the sickly sweet wine that was exported in the past Lago di Como Best for a slice of luxury If it s good enough for the Clooneys and vacationing Obamas it s good enough for mere mortals Nestled in the shadow of the Rhaetian Alps dazzling Lago di Como is Lombardy s most spectacular lake Its lavish Liberty style villas are home to movie moguls fashion royalty and literal royalty The lake s siren calls include gardens at Villas Melzi d Eril Carlotta and Balbianello that blush pink with camellias azaleas and rhododendrons in April and May The city of Como itself is a hotbed of arresting architecture from the Gothic cathedral to Palazzo Terragni â built by the Fascists as their party headquarters Itâ s a classic example of Italian Rationalism and a striking reminder of the atrocities committed by the regime Planning tip Como is like the Amalfi Coast â the roads are clogged and parking is a huge problem Instead of driving use public transport thereâ s an excellent ferry and bus network as well as a train line along the eastern edge of the lake Aerial view of a beach at Costa Smeralda in Sardinia Italy Ryzhkov Oleksandr Shutterstock Sardinia Best for beaches and coastline The English language cannot accurately describe the varied blue green and â in the deepest shadows â purple colors of Sardiniaâ s seas While models ministers and perma tanned celebrities wine dine and sail along the glossy Costa Smeralda much of the island â the Medâ s second largest after Sicily â remains a wild raw playground Explore its rugged coastal beauty from the tumbledown boulders of Santa Teresa di Gallura and the wind chiseled cliff face of the Golfo di Orosei to the windswept beauty of the Costa Verde s dune backed beaches Be sure to spend time inland too Youâ ll find some of Europeâ s finest prehistoric remains mysterious nuraghi megalithic buildings burial sites so grand theyâ re known as â giantsâ tombs â and the mountain villages of Barbagia where locals still practice centuries old traditions Naples Best for sheer italianitÃ Pompeii pizza and a whole lot of panache Naples is a city like no other Layered like lasagna each strip of history on top of the last this is a place where underground you can walk along ancient Greek and Roman roads Up at street level there are sumptuous churches baroque palaces and Maradona â Maradona everywhere Outside the city Vesuvius looms over the time capsules of Pompeii and Herculaneum while in town living in the shadow of a volcano gives life a sense of urgency Planning tip Naples becomes less chaotic from the water Taking the ferry isnâ t only an option if youâ re going to islands like Ischia and Procida â you can also take a boat from the city to Sorrento Positano and the Amalfi Coast A canal in Venice Adisa Shutterstock Venice Best for a fairytale city Unique is an overused word but in the case of Venice thereâ s no better description The city really is a dreamscape of intricately carved palazzos gilded churches and world class museums floating on water and crisscrossed by quiet canals Avoid the temptation to do a quick drop in visit to see the main sights the real Venice is in the silent canals and narrow alleyways which cast a spell on all who move through them Tick off the Rialto Bridge and Piazza San Marco but then stay on to experience this most precious and precarious of cities Local tip This is not the place to run a tight schedule Leave time to wander the alleys look inside the churches and artisan shops you pass and hop on a vaporetto thatâ ll chug through the islands of the lagoon Parco Nazionale del Gran Paradiso Best for hiking If you re pining for a mind clearing retreat lace up your hiking boots and explore more than miles of marked trails and mule tracks traversing â Grand Paradise â Part of the Graian Alps and one of Italy s very first national parks Gran Paradiso is a pure pristine spread that encompasses glaciers and alpine pastures It is awash with wild pansies gentians and alpenroses not to mention a healthy population of Alpine ibex for whose protection the park was originally established At the eponymous Gran Paradiso is the park s only peak accessed from tranquil Cogne The village of San Teodoro with Mt Etna in the background Getty Images Mt Etna Best for thrill seekers Known to the Greeks as the column that holds up the sky Mt Etna is not only Europe s largest volcano it s one of the world s most active The ancients believed the giant monster named Tifone Typhoon lived in its crater and lit the sky with spectacular pyrotechnics today they simply call it idda or her At she literally towers above Sicily s Ionian Coast Tackle the climb on foot on a guided tour or stick to the lower slopes where youâ ll find some of Italyâ s most exciting wines grown in the uber fertile volcanic soil Sicily is one of the nicest places in Italy to visit thanks to its extraordinary wealth of history and architecture its jaw dropping coastline and of course the ever welcoming Sicilians Cinque Terre and the Liguria coast Best for classic coastline Liguriaâ s remote Cinque Terre area is coastal Italy at its most spectacular Five seaside villages wedged between cliffs encircled by a national park and connected by clifftop footpaths this is a place where humanity has lived in symbiosis with nature for thousands of years People have chiseled terraces into the steep cliffs and grown wine here since Roman times until the century the locals got about by sea or footpath The villages themselves are gorgeous but spare some time for a hike along the Sentiero Azzurro the most popular of the paths connecting them Cinque Terre may be the best known but Liguriaâ s coastline is one showstopper coastal village after another â additional highlights include Portofino Porto Venere and Santa Margherita Ligure Planning tip This is another area where itâ s not worth driving There are ferry services but our favorite option is the train which runs along the coast and stops at each village The short conical houses of Alberobello Martin Jung Getty Images Valle dâ Itria Best for picture perfect villages They look like hobbit houses â small conical roofed cottages called trulli often stitched together to form a bigger home but always fairytale pretty whatever the size Puglia the heel of Italyâ s boot is famous for its trulli but you wonâ t find them all over the region Head south of Bari in from the coast and up onto the high karst plateau and youâ ll find the Valle dâ Itria where the green fields around towns like Cisternino and Locorotondo are dotted with trulli Alberobello is the center of it all â the centro storico of the town is nothing but streets of them This is one of the prettiest parts of Italy â truly Milan Best for a real city break Italyâ s fashion capital often gets a bad rap â too international too organized not chaotic enough Donâ t believe it Where else can you go from a Gothic style cathedral started in the century to masterpieces by Leonardo After all his Last Supper fresco in the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie is a showstopper but so is the Sala delle Asse in the Castello Sforzesco which he painted as a trompe lâ oeil forest bower a painting technique meant to deceive the eyes Milan s restaurants pull together the best food from the Italian peninsula itâ s home to one of Italyâ s rare cocktail scenes Similarly its fashion houses are transforming the cityâ s modern art scene with venues like Fondazione Prada an old distillery now housing works by the likes of Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst as well as putting on top notch temporary exhibitions Planning tip Milan doesnâ t really have high and low seasons like the rest of Italy instead its hotel rates rocket up and down depending on whether thereâ s a major event in town Avoid
