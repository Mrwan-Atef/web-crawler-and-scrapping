TRAVEL A guide to Kanazawa the next city break for Kyoto lovers Forged by samurai geishas and Edo era feudal clans the elegant garden city of Kanazawa is a quieter alternative to Kyoto for those seeking traditional Japanese culture By Daniel Stables October min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK The sound of drumming rises to a fever pitch fluttering rhythms in enigmatic time signatures shaking the century old rafters of In Kanazawa House Before me on the stage are two geishas or geikos as they re known in this city one playing the taiko drum the other accompanying her on the banjo like shamisen while singing It s an interplay unchanged since the century when wealth flowed through Kanazawa the seat of the influential Maeda clan Samurai were hired for protection geikos for entertainment The historic districts in which they lived and worked are beautifully preserved Kanazawa rivals Kyoto as the city that best embodies the Japan of picture books The elegance of the Edo era which shaped Japan from the to centuries reaches its apogee at Kenroku en a remarkable garden of ponds bridges and teahouses beside Kanazawa Castle close to the In Kanazawa cultural centre The music stops to warm applause replaced by an air of nervousness when an invitation is extended from the stage Who d like to play the drum Never able to stand an awkward silence I shoot a hand up and trudge to the stage trying desperately to remember the complex percussive patterns Thankfully the geikos go easy on me they demonstrate a simple rhythm in standard time hand me a mallet and urge me to join in Traditional teahouses where guests sit on tatami mats and are served matcha in a ceremonial fashion are part of Kanazawa s nostalgic charm Photography by Anna Mueller It
