celebrates the vegetarian dishes of her homeland By Caroline Morrish Photographs by Sam A Harris July This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK What are your earliest food memories I grew up in Antakya in southeast Turkey and spent childhood holidays there at my grandparents year old stone house They grew walnuts figs and pomegranates that my grandmother would use to make molasses I absorbed everything watching her and my mother cook My uncle and grandfather were food merchants and would bring cases of fresh produce home which were used in meals or preserved nothing was wasted And I loved going to the bakery and the farmers market with my father handpicking produce and chatting to the vendors Are markets still a big part of life today Very much so you ll find one at the heart of every neighbourhood Each is different depending on its location the local demographic and growing conditions They have regional ingredients straight from the producers and often a huge variety of olives pickles and cheese The bakery is a central part of our culinary tradition fresh pide flatbreads or somun loaves are bought daily Bakeries are also hubs where locals gather and many act as community ovens where people can take their bread to be baked instead of doing it at home Istanbul s food scene is heavily influenced by its immigrant communities evident within the city s markets and street food stalls Photograph by Sam A Harris Bakeries are central to Turkish communities with breads such as simit and lahmacun being popular sharing dishes Photograph by Sam A Harris What are the key ingredients in Turkish cooking The Ottoman Empire made a big contribution to the way we eat The sultan controlled the spice routes bringing the best spices and produce to the kitchens at Topkapi Palace Cumin and sumac are key flavours but pul biber aleppo pepper is probably the most used spice We don t just use it in cooking but also as a seasoning you ll find a pot on every Turkish table We re also a country of yoghurt lovers It s in almost everything dips meze and desserts And we produce the best nuts I now live in the UK and whenever I visit home I take an empty suitcase which I fill with nuts to bring back with me almonds from the Datça region pistachios from Gaziantep and hazelnuts from the Black Sea Is there a difference in food across the regions It s a vast land the climate and soil differ greatly as do the various ethnic communities that live across Turkey If you go to the Black Sea region you can feel the strong influence of the Ottoman Empire and there s a focus on ingredients such as tea corn and cornmeal anchovies and butter Southern Turkey has more spicy food pomegranate molasses and bulgur as well as the tradition of drying excess produce such as aubergines and peppers to preserve them or turn them into pastes Mainland Anatolia is known as the home of wheat and hearty food traditionally made to sustain people through the long winters while southeast Anatolia is the home of baklava Towards the Aegean the influence of the Med and the climate brings lots of citrus herbs and fish lighter flavours and vegetables cooked in olive oil Cabbage rolls are a popular European dish typically consisting of cooked cabbage wrapped around an assortment of fillings Photograph by Sam A Harris You lived in Istanbul for many years what s the food scene like there The city is welcoming and diverse and its food is greatly influenced by its immigrant communities There are amazing markets with different regional specialities Misir Carsisi spice market in the Old City is a special place to visit it s a feast for the senses and has huge displays of spices dried fruit and nuts The city also has brilliant street food one of my favourite things to do is to go to Ortaköy Square and grab a baked potato with delicious toppings from a vendor Then I eat it with a glass of çay Turkish tea looking out over the Bosphorus strait Or you can pick up a gözleme filled flatbread or simit sesame encrusted bread ring to enjoy on a ferry trip across the water Sebze Vegetarian Recipes from My Turkish Table by Özlem Warren Hardie Grant What might surprise people about Turkish cuisine Most people think of kebabs when they think of Turkish food and we do love them but that isn t what we eat at home With my new cookbook I wanted to showcase the variety of vegetarian dishes eaten in the country We love pulses legumes and wholegrains as well as vegetables and make lots of casseroles filled breads and pastries vegetable meze and pickles It s very seasonal naturally wholesome and frugal There s also a sharing element to Turkish food and a sense of community that I wanted to get across in the book That spirit of hospitality underlines everything we do it s in my DNA Published in Issue summer of Food by National Geographic Traveller UK To subscribe to National Geographic Traveller UK magazine click here Available in select countries
