Romanelli Getty Images Planning tips Whether you re a seasoned traveler or a first time visitor these suggestions will help you easily navigate your journey First when selecting your accommodation checking whether your room includes air conditioning is crucial Some guesthouses or Airbnbs may not offer this comfort and having it can make a significant difference to your stay especially during warmer months Be sure to pack mosquito repellent and any ointments or treatments you typically use for bites These simple precautions can keep you and your kids comfortable and itch free throughout your trip For those on medication filling any prescriptions before you travel is advisable Access to specific medicines can vary by location and having a sufficient supply ensures peace of mind during your stay Budget conscious travelers should inquire about children s discounts when booking tours Many operators offer reduced rates for younger participants which can help make your trip more affordable Lastly keeping an umbrella handy is a smart move if you plan to use public transportation Bus stops are often uncovered leaving you exposed to the elements An umbrella will provide protection from the sun s heat and shelter from unexpected rain showers Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address
