Thailand Ann Douglas Lott Feb min read Share Private pool villa for one please Anantara Mai Khao Phuket Resort While backpackers and shoestring travelers continue to explore the world with guidebooks in hand or e books on devices itâ s after all thereâ s a luxurious realm of travel that never fails to fascinate The new third season of The White Lotus which is set at an opulent resort on the Thai island of Ko Samui has escalated such curiosity globally Consider me curious no more Ladies and gents I am pleased to report that I did in fact find this season s grandeur and mystique at some of the very resorts on Ko Samui and Phuket where the series was filmed I could have visited Thailand â s gorgeous islands spending sublime days tracking down the best food lounging on amazing beaches hiking through forests and touring its temples DIY style and on a budget But I wanted to know if I could unlock the elevated yet still authentically Thai vibe depicted in the show â only without the dark drama and um homicide The third seasonâ s storyline may still be shrouded in mystery but one thingâ s for certain the lovely lotus flowers serene spas and ritzy resorts that grace our screens very much exist in real life Hereâ s how I found them and where The oh so cute Ko Samui Airport Markus Mainka Shutterstock Advertisement Getting there Ko Samuiâ s airport is owned by Bangkok Airlines which operates most flights connecting the island with Thailandâ s major cities Phuket Singapore Hong Kong and other destinations More airlines serve Phuket with direct flights from across Asia the Middle East and Europe I stayed one night in Bangkok after a business class journey on Cathay Pacific Airways â getting into character of course before continuing on to Ko Samui If youâ re traveling between multiple destinations in Thailand book your domestic flights as soon as possible The Ko Samui airport one of the most adorable Iâ ve visited is tiny and can accommodate only so many flights per day Where to stay While the Four Seasons is the official resort partner of The White Lotus another hotel brand played a large role in the showâ s filming Thai born and bred Anantara Hotels Resorts Anantara properties are known for their top tier spas â which tracks with the reappearance this season of Belinda the spa manager from the showâ s Maui set first season Three resorts figure in this new Thailand season Bophut Koh Samui Lawana Koh Samui and Mai Khao Phuket Villas I checked into all three to soak up the full White Lotus experience Getting around Traveling in style means private hotel transfers can guide you to and from airports and on excursions beyond resort properties Or download the Grab app which is Thailandâ s Uber equivalent For full on independence rent a car or motorbike to take to the road yourself What to pack Clothes so thin you can easily ball them up in your hand Seriously the humidity levels here donâ t mess around And neither does the sun â so pack plenty of SPF a swimsuit and a hat and donâ t forget deodorant If you plan to visit any temples dress modestly covering your legs and shoulders Buy a bottle of mosquito repellent as soon as you arrive If you prefer to leave the planning to someone else Anantara offers its own package to visit all three properties featured in the show If youâ d like to customize your trip or are simply curious about the vibes of each property keep reading Perhaps the most crucial element of this itinerary is what Iâ ve left out everything that comes in between When youâ re on vacation soaking up sunshine while pool or oceanside is a given â and thereâ s no better relaxation than at a luxury beach resort When I wasnâ t working on my tan this is everything I did on my Thailand trip The lotus pond at the Bophut property Anantara Bophut Koh Samui Resort First stop Anantara Bophut Koh Samui days Vibes From watching just the first episode itâ s clear that Bophut has all the elements The White Lotus â producers were looking for Flora is a key feature of the property with most rooms sprawling around a long rectangular lotus dotted pond thatâ s lined with a canopy of palms and paths leading guests to the pool area and beach Monkey statues adorn the property whose traditional Thai architecture features breezy open windows splashes of pastel hues and tall dark wood ceilings Advertisement My garden suite had its own porch and a spacious closet and bathroom area including â a true extravagance for this New Yorker â a large basin tub Eat Thai food constantly surpassed my expectations on this trip and I sampled other delicious cuisines along the way too The best table at the Bophut property is on the porch of Guilty a South American spot with a stunning view of the pool and beach That view tableside prepared guacamole and hibachi BBQ pork belly were all I needed at the end of the day Also letâ s please take a moment to shout out a solid hotel breakfast buffet Each resort offered both Thai and Western breakfast options but perhaps nothing felt more luxurious than snacking on fresh native fruits and sipping bright juices and smoothies in February knowing it was snowing back in New York Clockwise from top left A spa room The main driveway The lobby Wat Plai Laem Credits Anantara Bophut Koh Samui Resort Ann Douglas Lott Lonely Planet See A little set jetting roundup for your leisure viewers will recognize the resortâ s main driveway which also featured a security station that was built and then demoed by the showâ s crew the main lobby and the library which stood in as the hotel store in the show Book an appointment at the spa and you may be lucky enough as I was to get a lotus oil massage in one of the rooms Belinda is pictured in the season trailer Do Yes the characters in the show do leave the hotel property â and so should you The resort arranged an excursion for me including stops at two famous temples Wat Plai Laem and Big Buddha Temple Chaweng viewpoint one of the most popular views on the island overlooking the waves crashing on the rocks and Elephant Kingdom an ethical sanctuary where visitors can learn about local rescue efforts and feed rehabilitated elephants from a suspended platform Conveniently the Bophut property is also located next to Ko Samuiâ s Fishermanâ s Village which puts on a night market a few times a week Even more impressive is the twice a night fire show on the beach at Coco Tam â s right next to the market â a spectacle I recognized from the White Lotus trailer A pool suite at the Lawana property Anantara Lawana Koh Samui Resort Next stop Anantara Lawana Koh Samui days Vibes The Lawana property serves up pure relaxation with a heavy dose of that elusive privacy that one hopes for on a beach vacation Its open air lobby is backed by a small mountain or large hill at the top of which youâ ll find a scenic bar and the resortâ s most sought after dining experience more on that below Paths lead to small â neighborhoodsâ of varying room types from pool suites to entire villas In addition to parking myself by the resortâ s glass smooth infinity pool I was glad to check into one of the pool suites which featured a private walled pool shaded lounge chairs and a wooden swing over the pool Youâ re never too old Eat Reach out to the resort in advance to book a dinner at Tree Tops This top literally dining spot overlooks the entire property all the way to the beach and neighboring Ko Mad Lang I felt inspired to re watch The Swiss Family Robinson while savoring the multicourse menu among the branches aglow thanks to an army of lanterns While the menu changes seasonally my feast included rock lobster saffron seafood soup charcoal grilled wagyu strip loin with pumpkin purÃ e and passionfruit mango Bavarian cream Clockwise from top left Cruising aboard Sea Gypsy The Singing Bird Lounge A sweet treat passionfruit mango Bavarian cream Sunrise kayak session Credits Ann Douglas Lott Lonely Planet Anantara Lawana Koh Samui Resort See If you canâ t snag a reservation at Tree Tops or are in the mood for pre dinner drinks check out The Singing Bird Lounge The open air bar is a confirmed filming location in the series and its views are nearly identical to those from the restaurant next door Do Waking up early for the sunrise is mandatory at least one day when Iâ m on a beach trip In this case the morning sun created a magical backdrop while kayaking the short distance to Ko Mad Lang If movement isnâ t your thing at in the morning opt for a sound bathing session overlooking the beach Later in the day Lawanaâ s wooden yacht Sea Gypsy â similar to the boat that transports White Lotus guests in the first episode â can take you past picturesque islands until the sun sets Regardless of how you get out on the water hopping on a boat will most likely be a priority on your Ko Samui itinerary The lotus lagoon at the Mai Khao property Anantara Mai Khao Phuket Resort Final stop Anantara Mai Khao Phuket days Vibes Though this season is set on Ko Samui visitors to Phuket can discover a similar experience at Anantara Mai Khaoâ s pool villas Even the producers couldnâ t resist filming at this resort on Thailandâ s most touristed island â and boy does the property place bring the drama Upon passing through a towering walled lantern lined entrance I felt like I had entered a grand lagoon side village Wooden pathways over the lotus dotted lagoon â which encompasses most of the resort â connect the lobby main restaurant shop and bar to the rest of the property Down by the water the pool and beach chairs are set back from the main public beach to keep it accessible to everyone The cherry on top is the rooms More than rooms actually theyâ re deluxe private pool villas with towering ceilings spacious dressing rooms and bathrooms with outdoor poolside bathtubs accessed through a sliding door from the bathroom Each morning I walked a few steps to the sliding door in my bedroom and dipped my legs into the pool while listening to birdsong If you canâ t seem to break away to the rest of the resort count on pool bath bed repeat Eat Stay on the lotus theme with cocktails at Bua Bar bua means lotus in Thai before dinner next door at Tiffin by La Sala which offers both Indian and Thai menus When youâ re simply exhausted from sunning yourself by the pool grab lunch and drinks at Sea Fire Salt Sometimes I just need to eat popcorn chicken and a Caesar salad by the pool no matter which part of the world I m in Clockwise from top left Villa patio at Anantara Mai Khao Phuket Resort The spaâ s sound bathing room The lobby The main driveway Credits Anantara Mai Khao Phuket Resort Ann Douglas Lott Lonely Planet See Most of the filming at Mai Khao took place around its spa area including the very dramatic opening scene in the glass walled sound bathing room and surrounding lagoon I wonâ t give anything else away about the plot promise Scenes in Belindaâ s room were shot in one of the resortâ s villas Additional scenes were shot in Phuketâ s old town about an hour s drive away Do This place is like adult summer camp â in the best way Walk the palm lined paths or hail a golf cart to the wellness area where youâ ll find the resortâ s garden chicken coop bunny enclosure fitness center tennis courts and workout classes like yoga and Thai boxing You can also borrow bikes here to get around the property Thereâ s no doubt about it this adventure lies at the top of the dream trip category I hope youâ ve had fun indulging with me but remember this you can visit Thailand in a zillion different ways and youâ ll never have a bad time Ann Douglas traveled to Thailand on the invitation of Anantara Hotels Resorts Lonely Planet does
