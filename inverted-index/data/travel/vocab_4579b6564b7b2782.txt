Where to eat in Cincinnati Ohio The John A Roebling Suspension Bridge spans the Ohio River between Cincinnati and the Kentucky city of Covington Photograph by Jon Bilous Getty Images TRAVEL Where to eat in Cincinnati the Ohio city championing beer and bacon doughnuts Set on the Ohio River this Kentucky borderland city s culinary culture has been shaped by German settlers and farmland food defined by plenty of beer and comfort dishes like chilli dogs and bacon topped doughnuts By Stuart Forster April This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Among the dozens of flavoured spice rub blends arranged in tins at Colonel De Gourmet Herbs and Spices I ve singled out Ole Bourbon Trail It seems the ideal souvenir from this stall in Cincinnati s Findlay Market which is set barely a mile from Ohio s border with Kentucky America s bourbon state It s bold stuff brown sugar and smoky paprika giving way to a burst of coriander hickory and chilli Established in to sell produce from surrounding farms Findlay Market has evolved to offer significantly more Across the central aisle a woman buys chicken sausages from Neil Luken Meats fresh in from Gerber s Amish Farm in northeast Ohio A group of construction workers swagger past seemingly immune to the warm bready wafts of baking pizza at Bouchard s They opt instead for crimp edged Ukrainian dumplings filled with potato and cheddar and spinach and provolone at Babushka Pierogies An aromatic dukkah blend reminiscent of a Middle Eastern souq draws me into Dean s Mediterranean Imports lined with glass jars of Levant spices and refrigerators packed with tubs of homemade falafel hummus and tzatziki I buy a wrap containing all three plus a crunchy slaw chunks of ripe tomato and a garlicky hot sauce Despite the generous American portion I still can t resist the doughy aroma coming from The Arepa Place which serves the titular South American ground corn patties with salsa Filled with mozzarella cheese and then grilled the arepa is the ultimate comfort food I use it to scoop up the tomato based sauce whose potent chilli kick slowly unfurls Findlay has been in operation in this location for more than years says Barb Cooper of Cincinnati Food Tours who I ve joined in the market There s only a handful in the United States that have been around longer Attracting some visitors at weekends Findlay Market is at the heart of the resurgent Over the Rhine or OTR district an area named after the now covered canal at Cincinnati s downtown boundary OTR s architecture is something we treasure built mostly between to by German immigrants says Barb gesturing towards pastel painted facades above shopfronts as we tour the neighbourhood German heritage can be found too in Cincinnati s food where butchers have long used offcuts to make an inexpensive but filling protein rich sausage meat called goetta Pronounced getta Barb explains the delicacy is barely known beyond a mile radius of the city We call in at Ecklerlin Meats a Findlay business established in where John Holloway introduces himself I m sixth generation he says proudly Holding up a brick sized goetta loaf John says he s just pan fried a few slices in butter The soft texture and peppery seasoning remind me of haggis He smiles at my approving nod In the Cincinnati was America s hub for processing pork and is still known as Porkopolis The meat is the main ingredient in goetta often mixed with beef Back in the day when there was a hog or cattle slaughter from farms outside town anything that didn t have fur or bone went into your goetta pot says John You d add steel cut pinhead oats season with onion salt pepper and a couple of special ingredients to differentiate from your neighbour and cook it all day long let those oats break down Cool it overnight and that would be another meat option for the family Our final stop is Makers Bakers Co where Barb introduces co founder Kevin Foston who encourages me to tuck into a luscious mound of banana pudding spongy cake and sliced banana bound by cream and drizzled with a sticky bourbon caramel sauce Kevin recently collaborated with a brewery taproom Samuel Adams to create Cinnamon Roll Breakfast Bock The German style bock beer is dark and strong typical of those originally brewed to give monks energy during their Lent fast with added spice inspired by the sweet rolls Thanks to high demand from German settlers brewing was once commonplace in OTR Below its streets vast lagering tunnels were hewn from bedrock to store fermenting beer at a cool constant temperature for the likes of the defunct John Kauffman Brewing Company Today Cincinnati is packed with critically acclaimed craft breweries Two top venues Rhinegeist Brewery and Northern Row Brewery and Distillery are within easy staggering distance But I head to Moerlein Lager House in Smale Riverfront Park a modern microbrewery with a long history This riverside venue offers much beyond the giant pretzels and German sausages that may have fed its Bavarian blacksmith founder Christian Moerlein At a hefty wood table that wouldn t look out of place in a Munich beer hall diners enjoy the likes of barbacoa short ribs loaded fries and sriracha spiced cauliflower I order a pint of refreshing Das Über Oktoberfest style lager and gaze at the eddying Ohio River I m preparing myself for a Cincinnati classic The mascot of Cincinnati Reds baseball team at Findlay Market Photograph by Stuart Foster Revival Vintage Bottle Shop hosts bourbon tastings featuring selections from the century Photograph by Andrew Desenberg At a nearby branch of Skyline Chili one of many in the city I tuck into Cincinnati s best known dish Characterised by a thin sauce with hints of cinnamon and clove this local version of chilli is far milder than the jalapeño laced Tex Mex iteration We re celebrating our anniversary this year says Skyline Chili s Sarah Sicking Nicholas Lambrinides opened his first Skyline with his sons in using his mother s chilli recipes It s still a family business The diner style setting sees most patrons eat and leave within minutes Complimentary oyster crackers arrive seconds after I ve ordered On surrounding tables people dig into cheese coneys hot dogs in steamed buns served with chopped onions and chilli and almost buried in grated cheese Others order their chilli with spaghetti using what sounds like a secret code A three way is spaghetti with chilli and cheese explains Sarah A four way adds onions or beans and five way adds both Asking for the dish to be inverted puts the cheese at the bottom and spaghetti on top At under a regular sized three way is an inexpensive way of filling up while experiencing some unique local culinary heritage It s hearty stuff so I take a digestive evening stroll into the next state This actually takes just minutes crossing the Ohio River via the John A Roebling Bridge to arrive in Covington Kentucky While a city in its own right it has the feel of a well to do suburb and is considered part of metropolitan Cincinnati even playing host to its international airport Here at Revival Vintage Bottle Shop I find shelves lined with bottles more akin to museum objects than standard off licence wares I spot a bottle of Old Rip Van Winkle bourbon with a price tag of A bottle of Old Wilmore costs There are also dozens with double figure prices displaying labels with retro fonts and antiquated designs I think the best spirits have already been made says co founder Brad Bonds who seeks out old bottles from collectors and those idling in attics across the US If the original seals are intact he ll buy anything from bourbon rye and other types of whiskey with the occasional foray into other spirits including rums and tequilas One man s trash is another s treasure says Brad who opens a new bottle every day allowing customers to sample a pour of a spirit that may have been distilled before they were born Ordering a sample of Kentucky Tavern bourbon I sit at one of the four leather topped stools by the bar and swirl the golden liquid around the glass As a relative newcomer to bourbon I can t identify the characteristics that warrant buying a bottle from my birth year But at least I can try it A minute taxi ride back to OTR brings more vintage fun Here I descend to Ghost Baby a nightclub set in a year old lagering tunnel where I m shown to a booth lit by a tasselled lamp to watch a jazz trumpeter play a muted melody The scene reminds me of a classic film prompting the order of an old fashioned The cocktail s barrel proof bourbon warms my chest and causes me to exhale rapidly an experience I m told that s known locally as a Kentucky hug It s a fitting farewell to this borderlands city A
