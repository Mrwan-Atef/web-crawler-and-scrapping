read Share Hikers in Doi Inthanon National Park nirutti Shutterstock Chiang Mai has numerous pleasures that will keep visitors busy for days on end And the cityâ s appeal as a travel destination is only enhanced by its location in northern Thailand The â Rose of the Northâ is situated amid jungle blanketed hills and rolling rice fields a region where cottage craft industries still thrive and distinct temples dazzle In short the area around this lovely city all but cries out to be explored From lakeside pampering in Huay Teung Tao to hilltop hiking around Doi Inthanon here are five of the best day trips from Chiang Mai Advertisement Simple bamboo huts along the shore of Huay Tueng Thao reservoir Florian Augustin Shutterstock Tuck in to delicious Thai food in a waterfront hut Travel time mins by car or songthaew Technically a man made reservoir tranquil Huay Teung Tao is a placid lake where locals while away the day in simple bamboo huts that abut the water Itâ s particularly popular with families and groups of friends over the weekends and public holidays In recent years thereâ s been an increase in activities offered around the reservoir such as ATV riding or paddle boarding Still nothing beats settling into one of the huts for an afternoon of eating local Thai fare over bottles of beer Each hut is tied to a different restaurant all with similar menus quality and pricing Simply pick a spot order some food or drinks and stay as long as you like How to get to Huay Teung Tao from Chiang Mai Just miles away from the center of Chiang Maiâ s old city along the or â canal road â Huay Teung Tao is quick and convenient to get to in a songthaew pickup truck by calling a car with the Grab rideshare app or with your own set of wheels An umbrella artisan in Bo Sang Thailand Somrerk Witthayanant Shutterstock Hit the â handicraft highwayâ to see traditional artisan villages Travel time hours by car or songthaew Chiang Mai has long been a handicrafts hub known for its expert artisans practicing the disciplines of wood carving silversmithing weaving and more Today skilled practitioners continue to refine these traditional arts and crafts making shopping for baskets and furniture to jewelry and ceramics in the cityâ s many markets a true delight To get even more memorable souvenirs of your time in Thailand head east out of town on Hwy also known as the â handicraft highwayâ to reach the small villages of Bo Sang and San Khampaeng While Bo Sang serves as a center for umbrella and papermaking San Khampaeng specializes in textile and ceramic items Many workshops and showrooms are on the main road or marked with signs pointing the way For a contrasting perspective on Thailandâ s art and handicrafts traditions stop by the MAIIAM Contemporary Art Museum just a couple of miles from Bo Sang to take in exhibitions showcasing the work of contemporary Thai artists Alternatively if furniture and home decor are more to your taste go south of Chiang Mai toward Hang Dong and the woodcarving village of Ban Tawai How to get to Bo Sang and San Khampaeng from Chiang Mai Advertisement White songthaews depart for Bo Sang from near Warorot Market in Chiang Mai Otherwise taxis and Grab rides are readily available which are also the best option for reaching Ban Tawai Visitors in Doi Inthanon National Park Bangprikphoto Shutterstock Watch the sunrise at Doi Inthanon National Park Travel time hours by car or songthaew Taking its name from Thailand â s tallest peak Doi Inthanon National Park is one of the countryâ s best known national parks Covering more than sq miles sq km itâ s home to numerous waterfalls hiking trails viewpoints hill tribe villages and bird species The park is an understandably popular attraction especially in the countryâ s cold season November through January when temperatures drop at higher elevations and sometimes even frost appears â a phenomenon that delights Thai visitors used to sweltering tropical weather Sometimes it even makes the news Doi Inthanon is also one of the few national parks in Thailand thatâ s easy to drive through with smooth roads connecting key sites and attractions such as the Kaew Mae Pan Nature Trail This short but spectacular hiking route which requires the help of a local guide plus supplied bamboo hiking sticks winds through a section of the parkâ s best landscapes to beautiful viewpoints overlooking the surrounding valleys Many people explore Doi Inthanon as a day trip from Chiang Mai either on their own or through an organized tour You can also stay in basic bungalow accommodations or camp on the mountain overnight to wake up above the clouds How to get to Doi Inthanon from Chiang Mai A full day taxi service including the return journey and different stops around the park costs around around US A cheaper option is to hop in a shared songthaew heading in the direction of the park A motorcyclist on the Samoeng Loop Kris Wiktor Shutterstock Hop on a motorbike to tackle the Samoeng Loop Travel time hours by motorbike You canâ t visit Chiang Mai without getting out into its surrounding hills For those comfortable on two wheels the mile long long Samoeng Loop is a hit with locals and tourists alike especially on the weekends and in the drier cooler season Driving straight through will take you around hours Yet along the entire route youâ ll find plenty of places to stop off â including the Nam Tok Mae Sa a scenic though sometimes busy tiered waterfall thatâ s good for swimming and Queen Sirikit Botanic Gardens a huge manicured green space bursting with exotic flowers â so plan for four hours or more Though you could do the loop with a car and driver the journey itself â experiencing the air rushing by your face and taking in degree views â is the main appeal of the trip Scooter rentals are available from a number of operators in Chiang Mai You can also consider an organized motorbike tour around the loop How to do the Samoeng Loop from Chiang Mai Start by driving north out of town on Hwy to Mae Rim then turn left on to Hwy This will take you climbing up into the hills passing small rustic restaurants strawberry fields Royal Project agriculture initiatives and views of the valley before reaching the small village of Samoeng Turn left onto Hwy to start looping back toward Chiang Mai Wat Rong Khun in Chiang Rai is unlike any temple you ve seen before Â rmnunes Getty Images Photograph the picture perfect White Temple and Black House Travel time for both hours by car or bus While admittedly taxing as a day trip from Chiang Mai if you have limited time and wonâ t make it to neighboring Chiang Rai Province as part of your Thailand travels it is possible to see two of the regionâ s most beloved sites â Wat Rong Khun and Baandam â in one long day from Chiang Mai Commonly known in English as the White Temple though it is not actually a place of worship Wat Rong Khun was the brainchild of contemporary Thai artist Chalermchai Kositpipat This glittering white complex has many delightful quirks Visitors have to walk past a sea of yearning arms symbolizing desire to reach the templeâ s interior where trippy murals that include images of actor Keanu Reeves and Superman adorn the walls Nearby Baandam meaning â Black Houseâ is another otherworldly creation this time from the mind of Chiang Rai â born artist Thawan Duchanee Unlike the sparkling Wat Rong Khun Baandamâ s sprawling collection of structures sculptures and gardens feature dark teak wood and animal parts like pelts and skulls Both of these complexes will likely live long in the memories â or potentially the nightmares â of visitors How to get to the White Temple and Black House from Chiang Mai Rent a car to do the journey or look for one of several package tours to the temples that will likely pick you up from your hotel by and return to Chiang Mai in the evening around If you want to go it alone inexpensive buses run regularly
