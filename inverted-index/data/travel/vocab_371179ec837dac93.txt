End right now James Wong Jan min read Share Afternoon tea at The Grill Room is one of London s loveliest treats Cafe Hotel Royal When it comes to food London s West End district in the city center doesnâ t have the best reputation Popular with tourists due to the big attractions scattered around the area and packed with major theatre productions locals tend to associate it with overpriced and underseasoned food that you grab on the go But I disagree There are nine million Londoners one third of whom were born outside the UK Thousands travel into the West End daily to work and play and theyâ ve got to eat somewhere My immigrant parents recognised this simple fact and in the we opened a Chinese takeaway in Covent Garden On weekends we would exchange meals with neighboring Indian and Caribbean restaurants and we routinely held all our big family gatherings in Chinatown When Christmas rolled around Mom would splurge on dinner at a fancy hotel to ensure the most picturesque family photos Advertisement Admittedly the West End is not the most budget friendly part of London After all it s home to the city s poshest neighborhoods most iconic attractions museums and theaters Iâ ve fine dined and partied across the city for decades thanks to TopTable deals aka the Groupon media invitations when I worked in television and opting out of a pension plan completely not recommended All this personal experience has given me a shortlist of tried and tested spots so visiting friends never find themselves eating at chain restaurants in Leicester Square or tourist traps by Buckingham Palace These are my favorite places to eat in the West End right now Left Rondo s farm fresh eggs served Shakshuka style Rebbeca Hope Right Rondo London Relax with a peaceful Full English or eggs and oats at Rondo If Iâ m alone and catching up on work then Iâ ll go to The Hoxton Holborn for Rondo their lobby restaurant Itâ s a nice spot to remain undisturbed so bring a book and enjoy the morning at leisure The Full English breakfast is so filling Iâ ll usually skip lunch If you d rather have something lighter go for their organic porridge with banana and agave or their farm fresh eggs with sourdough toast How to get it Rondo opens at and walk ins are welcome Enjoy the breakfast of champions at The Riding House CafÃ My favorite place for breakfast with company is The Riding House CafÃ They have three casual chic outposts including Fitzrovia tube stop Oxford Circus If Iâ m feeling indulgent Iâ ll do the malted deep dish pancakes otherwise itâ s always the large eggs Benedict with Kassler ham How to get it Breakfast is served from on weekdays Bloody Marys are served from Left Walkmisu serves coffee and sweet treats straight from a classic red telephone box Walkmisu Right The coffee spot is famous for its tiramisu in flavors like pistachio and strawberry Walkmisu Make a sweet pit stop at Walkmisu Russell Square is such a gorgeous stroll but before you enter stop at the red phone box at its east entrance Inside thereâ s a cafe called tube stop Russell Square and the best thing about it is the homemade tiramisu They have rotational flavors beyond the classic such as strawberry and pistachio and usually costs around a fiver Many museum cafÃ s in Central London are worth visiting for coffee Try Espresso Bar by Muriel s in The National Gallery tube stop Trafalgar Square CafÃ Bar in The Photographerâ s Gallery tube stop Oxford Circus or the Courtyard CafÃ in The Wallace Collection tube stop Bond Street How to get it The phone box is only open Friday to Sunday midday to Classic Hong Kong fast food at Wong Kei Iâ ve been going to Wong Kei since the The Chinatown fixture tube stop Leicester Square is notorious for rude service but thatâ s what I love about it This is Hong Kong fast food with absolutely no frills and no small talk Advertisement How to get it Walk in sit down you might have to share a table and order their big bowl of juicy won ton noodle soup Itâ s cash only Attendant is a former Victorian public toilet James Wong for Lonely Planet Grab a coffee in quirky but fun Attendant For something quirky visit Fitzrovia s Attendant tube stop Goodge Street a tiny coffee bar located within a former Victorian menâ s public toilet yes really Built in it still has all the original porcelain urinals and floor tiles Donâ t worry itâ s all squeaky clean â thereâ s been no peeing here for over half a century The team uses seasonal espresso blends from their roastery and the brew is rich and aromatic How to get it The lavatory is open to customers from to on weekdays and to on weekends Reservations aren t accepted it s first come first served Spill the tea at Mariage FrÃ res As this is London you can t visit without spilling the tea over afternoon tea I like Mariage FrÃ res tube stop Covent Garden because their first floor salon de thÃ is so ornate and the view over King Street is great for people watching Being part of a tea shop the brew list is massive akin to a wine list Try the signature Marco Polo black if itâ s your first time which pairs perfectly with their scones How to get it The salon de thÃ is open from midday to If you d like to purchase some tea to enjoy at home the counter is open from to Chinese restaurant Chop Chop is renowned for its roast duck James Wong for Lonely Planet Get the best roast duck in London at Chop Chop Craving Peking duck Mom and I go to Chop Chop in the basement of Hippodrome Casino The papers say itâ s the best roast duck in the world and while we disagree weâ ve been to Beijing it is the best weâ ve eaten in Central London How to get it Open from to every day As Chop Chop is within a casino it s over only Relax with a pint in Audley Public House My most beloved pub is Audley Public House tube stop Bond St Built in this beautiful listed building has a colorful ceiling designed by London artist Phyllida Barlow The bar serves beer from an independent supplier in Battersea called Sambrookâ s Brewery but youâ ll get all your liquor mainstays too Do as the locals do and accompany your pint with a scotch egg How to get it Rock up anytime between and Monday to Saturday The bar closes at on Sundays The menu expands to include a roast dinner on Sunday â food service starts at midday Japanese food for every budget Tokyo Diner and Roketsu This part of London has the best Japanese food in the capital For casual eating try the hearty bento boxes from Tokyo Diner tube stop Leicester Square which cost between Â US A bit more upmarket is Roketsu tube stop Marble Arch which only has space for diners It offers a traditional nine course Kaiseki dining experience each evening that s centered around dashi Japanese soup stock Dishes change monthly Allow two and a half hours for dinner How to get it No reservation is required at Tokyo Diner It s open between and closed on Mondays Reservations are essential at Roketsu James and friends dine with Woflgang Puck at Puck Lane James Wong for Lonely Planet Step up the glamor at Park Lane West End dining is synonymous with glamor and star hotel Park Lane tube stop Green Park hosts some legendary dinner parties My friends and I once had chef Wolfgang Puck join us for dinner at its American steak restaurant CUT I recommend the lamb chops and a table next to Damien Hirstâ s Diamond Dust Psalms series We also like the steak at The Connaught Grill and Amazonico Pro tip to dine fancy in Mayfair on a budget look out for Sunday Roast specials How to get it Dinner is served at CUT between and Booking ahead is advised There isn t a strict dress code but it s wise to leave the shorts and sportswear at home Go underground for a cocktail at Cahoots Every visitor I take to Cahoots tube stop Oxford Circus has a brilliant time but then who doesn t love a themed cocktail bar in an abandoned train station There are three rooms comprising a ticket hall a signal station and my favorite a tube carriage The cocktails are so creative and come in funky mugs like the Winston Churchill made from Bombay Sapphire gin cherry liqueur guava citrus essence tropical fassionola syrup and topped with pink grapefruit soda How to get it Come on Friday and Saturday nights for live music and themed events Always book ahead The Grill Room s traditional afternoon tea includes finger sandwiches delicious savoury treats and a top tier of show stopping desserts CafÃ Royal Refresh like royalty at The Grill Room This is the kind of high tea you keep for special occasions â The Grill Room at CafÃ Royal tube stop Piccadilly Circus Frequented by Oscar Wilde and Princess Diana it s housed within a majestic Grade II listed golden boudoir The traditional tier features sandwiches scones cakes plus accompanying tea and itâ s only an extra Â US to add champagne How to get it CafÃ Royal is open for afternoon tea daily between midday and Reservations are advised as it gets very busy especially during the festive season Dance into the night at the Friendly Society Friendly Society in Soho tube Piccadilly Circus is a classic LGBTIQ hangout As the name suggests Iâ ve stepped outside with armies of new pals over the years The crowd is diverse and they play music that makes you smile The more you drink the trippier the kitsch decor of disco balls and Barbie heads seems to get How to get it The entrance to this basement bar is in Tisbury Court just off Wardour Street Doors open at daily Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real England Let a local
