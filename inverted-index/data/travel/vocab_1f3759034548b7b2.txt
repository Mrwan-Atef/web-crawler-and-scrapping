Take a mangrove foraging tour with Broome s Aboriginal custodians in Australia TRAVEL Take a mangrove foraging tour with Broome s Aboriginal custodians An early morning walk through the mangroves in Broome Western Australia reveals how this rich ecosystem has sustained the country s First People since time immemorial Mangroves dot the shallow waters of Roebuck Bay in Western Australia Photograph by Paul Fowler Getty Images By Justin Meneguzzi October This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK The little octopus didn t expect to be a spectacle this morning It was minding its own business relaxing in an abandoned crab hole moisturised in a slick layer of dark mud when out of the blue came a wandering finger The octopus just squirted me shouts Bart Pigram pulling his hand back and laughing at the little jet of water intended to shoo him away Bart had expected to find some tastier tucker a mud crab but was just as surprised as the mollusc he d disturbed Taking the octopus s message Bart picks up his long metal crab hook and leaves it be instead leading us further out into the vast mudflats just south of Broome known to the Yawuru people as Rubibi It s and the tide has retreated so far the Indian Ocean is a barely visible glitter on the horizon In its wake it s left hundreds of metres of exposed crab holes and tangled mangrove roots They emit an aroma a little like rotten eggs which mingles with the briny air To my untrained eye it seems a barren place but for Bart it s like a supermarket In Broome s Roebuck Bay in northwestern Australia was designated a Ramsar wetland an honour recognising the marine park s unique ecosystem and the vast web of life that depends on it In the warmer months Bart is joined by nearly shorebirds who descend to nest and feast on worms crabs and molluscs joining chattering flying foxes roosting in the mangrove trees snubfin dolphins foraging in the shallows and shy octopuses hiding in the sludge Bart Pigram a Yawuru guide teaches guests about the wildlife culture and coast of Broome Photograph by Justin Meneguzzi Growing up my family would come out here sometimes three times a day to eat says Bart as he guides us out to the intertidal flats the path starting as a track between crowded mangroves before opening up to a vast muddy expanse As a Yawuru man born in Broome Bart belongs to a long line of custodians Aboriginal people with responsibility for caring for their land going back at least years For generations the Yawuru have lived along the coast hunting in the mangroves and foraging in the woodlands Lasting two hours the walk with Bart who owns Narlijia Experiences Broome is barely enough time to scratch the surface of his knowledge Charmingly down to earth Bart tells me how toxic grey mangrove fruit can be eaten after fermenting it in mud for a week and how his ancestors would light fires at night along the banks to attract unsuspecting mullet and then boomerang them in the dark Some of the old ways aren t done anymore because there are other ways that are more convenient like a fishing rod explains Bart as we approach an isolated rocky outcrop jutting out of the flats He pauses then plunges his hook deep into the mud and pulls It s not clear what he s done at first but after a few seconds a large clawed crab appears in the muck and tumbles belly side up onto the mud Its claws scrabble furiously at the blue sky Alright mate you re bloody lucky says Bart turning to me with a grin on his face It s mud crab for morning tea Moving with an added pep in his step and a resigned looking mud crab dangling beside him Bart explains how a small air bubble was all it took to betray the crab s location We take a wide loop through the mangroves back to where we started While the purpose of Bart s tours is to explore the coast and learn about the area s unique natural and cultural history every experience is different depending on the season and what he finds It just so happens this tour is ending in a cook up Bart paces along the banks salvaging dry branches and coconut husks to use as kindling then starts to build a small fire The carapace chars and foams the smoke sweetening the air with the promise of juicy crab meat He expertly prepares our mid morning snack and hands me a claw We eat sitting cross legged on ochre soil in the shade of a baobab tree keeping one eye on the turquoise tide as it slowly sweeps back into the mangroves and submerges the flats once more How to do it Narlijia Expereinces Broome s guided mangrove walks start from A for
