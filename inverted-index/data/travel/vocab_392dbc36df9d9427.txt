Share Flying is expensive but it s the quickest way to get to the Galapagos Islands Â Matt Henry Gunthernau Getty Images Ecuadorâ s irregular topography and geographical richness are some of the top reasons travelers choose to visit the South American nation However when it comes to navigating around its territory the same qualities pose challenges for visitors Thankfully Ecuadorâ s straightforward road system affordable gas prices and budget friendly overland transportation ease the hurdles of moving around the country Air travel is expensive but saves time Traveling to Ecuador by plane is not nearly as cheap as flying to neighboring nations The countryâ s taxes and high airfare fees are a hindrance for everyone particularly residents looking to fly domestically Regardless flying remains one of the less time consuming options to travel between the main cities Quito Guayaquil and Cuenca which otherwise takes up to hours on the road Advertisement Flying is also one of the few options to visit the GalÃ pagos Islands â cruises are also available but planes are by far the cheapest and most popular way of getting there Expect prices to fluctuate between US to for round trip flights in mainland territory and about twice that for trips to the GalÃ pagos Islands LATAM is a popular airline among locals for internal flights Buses can get you pretty much anywhere in Ecuador Â Getty Images Buses will take you nearly anywhere A solid alternative to moving between cities and skipping planes is hopping on a bus Much like in the rest of South America buses are a preferred and reliable means of transportation for locals due to their reach â most cities and towns have designated areas or central bus stations terminal terrestre Ecuadorâ s easy to travel size will keep trips short and not overly taxing Prices depend on the distance between destinations but the longest rides â for example from Huaquillas on the border with Peru to Carchi on the border with Colombia â could last up to hours and cost between US and Shorter trips between neighboring towns and cities start at If youâ re on a budget traveling long distances at night might help you save a few bucks on accommodation Picking a bus company for your trip will depend on the available routes according to your departure and destination points Flota Imbabura pet friendly and Transportes Occidentales are some of the transportation companies offering routes that traverse the country Take your time researching as some units might not offer a lot of amenities â though wifi reclinable seats and in a few cases restrooms are increasingly common Always keep an eye on your belongings and hide any valuables when traveling by bus Conversely keep documents on hand in case the bus stops for military checkpoints Due to the current security crisis in Ecuador itâ s best to opt for transport companies that donâ t stop on the road to pick up more passengers or hire private transportation companies such as JL Turismo Transporte which provides options for both individuals and groups of up to people If your budget allows it another safe alternative is tailoring a bespoke route on hop on hop off bus tours In contrast to intercity and interregional traveling bus transportation within cities can be trickier Routes are rarely listed in detail there are no scheduled time slots for buses to arrive and sometimes youâ ll need to ride more than one bus to arrive at your destination Advertisement Fees however are inexpensive and range from US to depending on the city and destination â traveling from urban centers to rural parishes is more expensive Quito s new Metro makes getting around the city much easier Â John and Tina Reid Getty Images Opt for urban transport if youâ re on a budget In cities such as Quito and Guayaquil bus rapid transit BRT systems like Trolebus trolleybus and MetrovÃ a will offer a more organized alternative as you tour urban centers However donâ t expect the experience to be particularly comfortable during rush hours as people often opt for BRT because itâ s quicker Quitoâ s newly debuted underground system Metro de Quito has steadily become a time saving choice for traversing the city It takes about minutes to cross from north to south with stops at key points in the city including Parque La Carolina Universidad Central one of the biggest national universities in Ecuador and Plaza de San Francisco in the historic center Although having a transportation card for the Metro will save you time queuing you wonâ t need one to ride the trains All youâ ll need is some cash US for a one way ticket Cash is also the preferred method for paying on buses and most urban transportation systems so donâ t forget to carry pocket change if you plan to ride any of them One of the exceptions is Cuencaâ s modern and comfortable tramway which is only accessible with a card that can be purchased at the tramway stops Driving in Ecuador gives you flexibility but is not for the faint hearted Â Ascent PKS Media Inc Getty Images If you want to discover Ecuador at your own pace rent a car Visitors who favor independence and flexibility should rent a car Budget friendly petrol prices and relatively easy to navigate roads make rentals a good option Car rental requirements will vary according to companies but a driving license and passport will suffice for those over Younger people might need to pay a surety in some rental places Agencies such as Avis Europcar and Goldcar are easy to find Theyâ re generally located at major airports in big cities or close to transport hubs in smaller cities â make sure to search online for the best addresses and to check their car availability before landing in the country If youâ re renting only to get around a city a standard sedan will fit the bill However if you aim to use the rental to explore Ecuadorâ s majestic landscapes consider a vehicle an added expense While on the road be mindful of Ecuadoriansâ sometimes dangerous driving habits Speeding changing lanes abruptly or illegal passing aren t rare occurrences on Ecuadorian roads Keep a defensive attitude and avoid getting too close to larger vehicles such as buses and trucks as these drivers often disregard speed limits Always check weather updates and pack a physical map especially if youâ re venturing into tiny towns and remote places where cell reception is unstable For your safety be cautious when traveling on the coast Donâ t stop by isolated places try not to veer away from main roads and if possible avoid driving at night Taxis are a great option for short trips in urban areas Â Hubert Stadler Getty Images Taxis and apps are the easiest way to get around â and theyâ re quite affordable If youâ re unsure about public transportation taxis and apps like Uber are an easy to use and affordable means of transportation As a safety measure verify that the cars you ride all have a plate If youâ re opting for an app check that the license plate number matches the number listed online Since March Uber users have benefited from an additional safety layer To make sure they get in the assigned vehicle users receive a digit PIN code that the driver must confirm in order to start the trip In major cities taxis generally work with a meter so make sure the device is on when you set off In small cities and towns most taxis have a standard and super affordable fee that shouldnâ t surpass US regardless of the distance When in doubt ask your travel guide or hotel staff for recommendations as many work with trusted and reliable taxi or transportation companies Accessible transportation Just like many Latin American countries providing accessible transportation remains a challenge for Ecuador Wheelchair friendly transportation is limited to a few public transportation systems like BRT systems and the Metro in Quito Most urban transportation companies operate with step entrance buses and are not adapted for wheelchairs However some interregional companies might provide space and special help upon request The best option for travelers with disabilities is to book accessible tours with companies like Latin America For All which specializes in crafting tour experiences for people with disabilities and their travel companions Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real
