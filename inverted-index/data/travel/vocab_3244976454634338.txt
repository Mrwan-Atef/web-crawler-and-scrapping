to CancÃºn with this seasonal guide Pola Damonte Getty Images Known for its spectacular combination of Caribbean beaches vibrant round the clock party scene and all inclusive high rise resorts CancÃºn is a world class destination Add to that leafy downtown plazas Maya ruins and a nearby national park and it s no wonder it s a popular place to visit Advertisement But knowing what each season brings â the rise and fall in prices sunny or stormy forecasts crowded dance floors or quiet beach days or the migration of sea creatures â will help you plan and make your vacation in CancÃºn that much more rewarding This seasonal guide can help you plan the best time for your visit San Miguelito is one of the Maya ruin suites to see Mardoz Shutterstock December to April is best for perfect weather and partying CancÃºnâ s weather is just about perfect in winter and spring with sunny days and balmy nights The beaches are picture postcards â ribbons of white sand alongside turquoise blue water â great for building sandcastles sitting under a palapa thatched sun shade with a good read or snorkeling on nearby reefs Kiteboarders will also find ideal conditions on nearby Isla Blanca with strong and consistent winds The temperate weather makes for easy sightseeing at CancÃºnâ s Maya ruins of El Rey and San Miguelito as well as nearby eco parks and outdoor markets For those looking for a party in CancÃºn thereâ s no better time for it International crowds descend on the Zona Hotelera CancÃºnâ s resort district during this season making for a thumping bumping party scene especially during New Yearâ s Eve spring break and Semana Santa Holy Week the week after Easter when Mexicans flock to the beaches Bars and nightclubs are jam packed until the wee hours often with celebrity DJs and live bands amping up the vibe During the day the party continues at beach clubs with open bars music and edgy contests of all sorts Religious parades and Carnaval fill the streets During this period downtown CancÃºn is hopping with celebrations of a different sort DÃ a de Nuestra SeÃ ora de Guadalupe Mexicoâ s patron saintâ s day Christmas Dia de los Reyes Magos Three Kings Day and Easter all include religious processions and family oriented parties in most of the cityâ s neighborhoods Meanwhile Carnaval brings another vibe parades with magnificent floats and scantily clad dancers wild costumes street parties and concerts in CancÃºnâ s main plaza Parque de las Palapas The season ends with a citywide celebration of CancÃºnâ s founding with free open air concerts and a lively parade along Avenida Tulum Advertisement Of course the downside of perfect weather and constant parties is that prices are inflated on everything from airfares to margaritas Hotel rooms can be scarce too Be sure to book your flights and accommodations far in advance and expect to pay a premium during the December holidays spring break and Semana Santa Sea turtles hatch on shore and make their way to the ocean during July and August Â M M Sweet Getty Images July to August is best for spotting wildlife Though the heat and humidity are at their height in July and August that doesnâ t stop travelers especially Mexicans from spending their summer vacation in CancÃºn Sure there are occasional rain showers but the sun always manages to peek out The beaches begin to fill up after a lull in May and June plus the warm nights keep partiers bar hopping and dancing til dawn The increase in visitors also sees higher accommodation rates though they never hit winter spring costs book in advance for the best options and prices See whale sharks and sea turtle hatchlings This time of year also brings the height of the whale shark season a parade of gentle giants that come to feed in nearby waters typically just north of Parque Nacional Isla Contoy Local dive shops offer snorkeling tours to swim alongside these behemoth fish which can measure up to in length Book your tour a few days in advance as they can fill up Likewise these are optimal months to watch sea turtle hatchlings make their first journey to the sea Some hotels organize turtle releases on their beaches typically in the middle of the night to watch tiny hawksbill loggerhead and green turtles dig their way out of their sandy nests to the ocean Nesting areas are often fenced off each nest marked with small signposts Itâ s important to follow the rules and avoid interacting with the hatchlings Independent guides also offer trips to more isolated beaches including Isla Blanca just north of town DÃ a de Muertos is a huge celebration in Mexico held at the start of November Â Sergio Carrasco Sony Photography Awards May to June and September to November are best for budget travelers and fewer crowds May to June and September to November see fewer visitors to CancÃºn which means a dramatic drop in prices â deals on hotels excursions airfares and even cover charges are the norm The reason Starting in May the days begin to get increasingly some say unbearably hot and muggy in June the rain showers begin signaling the official start of hurricane season November marks the end of hurricane season The sargassum seaweed that has afflicted the Caribbean typically arrives in the summer too But donâ t be discouraged by the forecast The sun still shines most days in May and June and while the waves are more powerful the resorts do an impressive job of daily seaweed cleanup All to say the beaches are still gorgeous and with fewer people around itâ ll feel like you have them to yourself Thereâ s also still plenty of partying to be had especially by locals hitting the clubs â itâ s CancÃºn after all The best cheap deals are in September and October September and October are the slowest months of the year bringing an additional dip in prices most notably at all inclusive resorts and international chain hotels The rain gets heavier and the risk of tropical storms increases historically autumn is when theyâ ve hit the region Keep an eye on the weather and take hurricane warnings seriously â head inland if needed CancÃºnâ s nightlife dampens too with partying mostly limited to the weekends In October some tour operators and restaurants close shop for the month November marks a change with Day of the Dead celebrations reinvigorating downtown CancÃºn and the Zona Hotelera The beautiful weather also returns â the temperature is pleasantly warm and the rain finally stops Tourist numbers remain low until the end of the month so the beaches stay gloriously empty and prices stay low
