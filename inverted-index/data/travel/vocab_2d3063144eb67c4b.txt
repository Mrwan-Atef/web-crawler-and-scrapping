Explorers Journey Into Africa s Okavango Delta TRAVEL They Journeyed Into One of the Last Great Wildernesses Here s How It Changed Them A multinational team of conservationists spent a grueling transcendent four months on a mile expedition to save the Okavango Delta but the mission s just beginning The expedition crew begins a morning on the Cubango River the swifter flowing of the Okavango s tributaries It s a unique opportunity in our world now to protect such a vast impact system says expedition lead Steve Boyes Photograph by Pete Muller National Geographic By Rachel Brown April min read In northwestern Botswana the arid ground of the Kalahari Desert gives way beneath the thousand green fingers an unfurling hand of permanent marshes and seasonal floodplains knuckled with islands whorled by shifting channels and streams known as the Okavango Delta The inland terminus of a massive wetland that traces its sources north through the Namibian panhandle to rivers in the Angolan highlands it s Africa s largest intact watershed It s a UNESCO World Heritage site giving shelter to thousands of unique species of flora and fauna and sustenance to a million people including indigenous groups whose communities line the rivers and dot the delta When winter floodwaters reach Botswana the square mile plain is visible from space For some it s become the center of the world You feel like you ve been looking for something your whole life says Steve Boyes a conservation biologist and National Geographic Fellow who has made the delta his life s work And then you find it The first time he saw the Okavango Delta at years old in the South African quit his job and told his university supervisor I ll try to finish my master s degree from Botswana but I m going Bye Raised in Johannesburg by ardent nature lovers ornithologist Steve Boyes describes feeling like he d searched his entire life to find the Okavango Delta Photograph by Pete Muller National Geographic It was the start of a calling that would eventually lead Boyes and a team of equally zealous conservationists to undertake an expedition that by their own estimation was slightly insane to survey the entire system from beginning to end in a whole hearted attempt to learn anything and everything they could use to protect it SOURCE TO SAND Over a decade of fieldwork during which he did in fact finish his master s as well as a Ph D Boyes came to realize the only way to preserve the Okavango is to preserve all of it headwaters to endpoint A patchwork of game reserves and other managed areas protect the system s Botswanan swath But the delta s richness obscures its dependence on water management in Namibia where agricultural irrigation schemes divert and pollute the tributary Cubango River and in Angola where a brutal year civil war and its lingering consequences have divorced the southeastern highlands from the rest of the nation leaving the delta s vulnerable headwaters to a management vacuum Boyes along with the National Geographic Okavango Wilderness Project he directs envisions a protected area that spans the entire Okavango Basin in its three constituent countries But data comes before policy and they needed data So in May of Boyes and a team of scientists and guides set out with literal tons of gear to canoe a mile path from the origin of the Cuito River through that tributary s course to meet the Cubango River transecting the delta to end at the salt flats marking the delta s southern edge Read more from the magazine on the expedition The expedition had less than auspicious beginnings Nothing good could ever happen there Adjany Costa once said of her country s common perception of the highlands An Angolan ichthyologist and the project s assistant director she remembers how when she was a young child the war s violence reached even to her family s living room in Luanda the capital In the highlands things were even worse Belligerents on both sides planted land mines throughout the area where the expedition was to launch over a decade after the conflict s end thousands still remain A humanitarian mine removal organization accompanied the expedition to ensure routes were clear But safely reaching the launch point didn t mark the end of the challenges The satellite imagery Boyes pored over for months had hidden the fact that at its source the Cuito River wasn t a river at all barely a stream more a trickle through waist high grass and impassable by mokoro the team s delta style dugout canoes So they harnessed themselves up for eight arduous days of dragging the seven foot boats loaded with equipment one after the other through the peaty marshland collecting data all the while Learn how peat bogs can reduce carbon emissions Adjany Costa an Angolan marine biologist collects plant and water samples in the delta s Angolan headwaters Though her role as assistant director of the Okavango Wilderness Project now combines field work with politics Costa was a permanent member and the only female member of the expedition she ll also join this a stretch of this year s expedition Photograph by Pete Muller National Geographic We know that we can t repeat these things so we gather as much information as possible on the spot Boyes says As it turns out as much as possible is a monumental volume of data As the river finally opened to navigability the information rolled in in earnest Data pods measured water quality against seven parameters in two second intervals scanners imaged the river structure beneath the boats peat cores were taken camera traps were set Boyes an ornithologist led the sighting calls cranes jacana and kingfishers but hippopotamuses and crocodiles and antelope as well with each observation precisely geotagged One gigabyte of data the equivalent of emails was uploaded each day for days I killed a lot of fish collecting specimens for study Costa admits ruefully I m not proud of it The team survived a clash with a hippo that capsized Boyes s boat which was repaired and back on the water in two hours They spent nights watching man made bush fires creep to the far edge of the river and days fighting through passages choked with trees destabilized by erosion the fires exacerbate Other days when the river was broad their canoes left tracks like handwriting on the aquatic grasses waving beneath the dark transparent water And all the while science Along the Cuito River human caused brush fires force trees and plants to grow into the water Such choked passages are a challenge to traverse and they also worsen erosion disrupting the river s flow and affecting ecosystems downstream Photograph by Cory Richards National Geographic Steve Boyes right and filmmaker Neil Gelinas fend off a cloud of sweat bees after a long day on the river during which one mokoro was capsized Photograph by Cory Richards National Geographic It s just part of your routine Boyes says Expedition to me is like Groundhog Day Every single day you do exactly the same thing In September two months later than planned the expedition jubilant exhausted ground by the wild to the finest human points reached the end They had collected over geotagged sightings observed species not previously known to exist in Angola and described species potentially new to science The next months were devoted to analyzing and reporting on their mountain of data petitioning government authorities and planning future expeditions See the team s expedition to dive the source lakes of the Cubango But in many ways the journey still hasn t ended RARE AND EXCEPTIONAL BEAUTY The Okavango is an invaluable wilderness The biodiversity it supports is crowned by the world s largest remaining population of elephants whose movements shape and reshape the delta s channels and landscapes It s easy to see why tourists a year flock to delta outposts on safari but it takes a different kind of person entirely to throw themselves headlong into the wild I don t think I was thinking Costa laughs of her decision to join the expedition For the then year old scientist the rough adjustment to field life was compounded by the difficulty of being the only woman on a crew of over a dozen men But she too had been hit by Boyes s delta fervor Two months in the expedition crew called a government helicopter to medevac a team member who d broken his arm in a fall Costa s father a former soldier unexpectedly accompanied the medics intent on taking her home He could see I was struggling Everyone was Costa says I told him Listen I ve never quit anything in my life I m not going to start now He almost cried I think it made him both sad and proud at the same time Her fortitude impressed Boyes but didn t surprise him Once someone s experienced the wild they really do repurpose their lives he says It s an addiction It s family To be thrust into the present moment by the wilderness Everything is stripped away That s survival That s the human experience in the wild and we ve become wild The team gathers over a dinner of rice and beans When you sit round the fire at night says Boyes You can say anything that you saw that day whether it s a small little white collared kingfisher or a big fish eagle and every single person sitting there saw it because everyone was connected to that moment Photograph by Cory Richards National Geographic The Okavango is wild but for some it s not so unknown The team s polers and guides Botswanans born and raised in the delta including a member of the ba Yei minority shared knowledge without which the expedition would have foundered PEOPLE POWER For Costa the people living along the tributaries Angolan banks changed her just as much as the wilderness did This expedition made me a person I didn t feel like a person before she says It wasn t just the contact with wildlife it was the contact with my own people I lived during the civil war but that is absolutely nothing absolutely nothing compared to what these people have been through Land mines have killed thousands and injured tens of thousands in Angola beginning in during its struggle for independence from Portugal The Battle of Cuito Cuanavale a town on the Cuito River and part of the Okavango watershed was the largest battle on African soil since WWII Photograph by Cory Richards National Geographic Civil war swiftly followed Angola s independence from Portugal as a power struggle between former liberation movements became a surrogate arena for Cold War conflict To escape the violence some civilians of the southeastern highlands retreated into the remotest areas collapsing bridges and living isolated among minefields to the present day The crew was a month into the expedition before they saw signs of humans at all women washing cassava at the river who ran at the sight of them and only reluctantly heard out Costa when she followed to explain Invited back to the village the crew listened to the chief say through Costa s translation that if he were to ask the government for anything it would be for oil salt a paved road a nurse and a teacher in that order It was so humbling Costa says I m so grateful that I had the opportunity to see what these people look like live like feel like think of it just gave me a greater connection to the whole system and to understand how these people are part of it Meet the journalist who traveled to Angola retracing the steps of a long lost ancestor It s a huge responsibility interacting with people like that Boyes says Our agenda is to support and assist and learn from them A lot of people will come down the roads we ve made with a different agenda As minefields are cleared the highlands become vulnerable to another kind of mine The extraction of diamonds and oil comprises over half of Angola s economy The Okavango Wilderness Project is working with the Angolan government to make sure indigenous villagers heritage rights are taken care of says Boyes To make sure they get to be the custodians of those forests Which they are And it mustn t be taken away from them But Costa admits that the Angolan government is not used to having a five armed octopus We have to give them one thing to do at a time While the Project s political efforts concentrate on establishing a protective legal status for the entire Okavango Basin those in the field undertake the slow work of building empowering partnerships with villagers in the watershed We started on the low Costa says After years of conflict the villagers members of the Luchaze and Tchokwe ethnic groups had lost their connection to the environment focusing on survival over sustainable management Angola once called Africa s living room for its thriving elephant populations now has one of the continent s highest poaching rates The team s mokoros wind past a riverbank ravaged by brush fires Though the fires flush game for local hunters they also destroy the marsh grasses root systems leading to erosion and disruption of the river s structure and flow Photograph by Cory Richards National Geographic The landscape has been reshaped by industrial agriculture in Namibia s Caprivi Strip By diverting waters for irrigation and opening the system to agricultural runoff these practices impact water health downstream Several hydroelectric dams have also been proposed at points along Okavango tributaries in Namibia and Angola Photograph by Cory Richards National Geographic We re trying to bring back their childhood memories of relationships with nature animals plants so they can get a sense of belonging again Costa says But we re not imposing changes It s giving them all of these tools so they understand the benefits they understand what s at stake and how their lives can improve a future that they can have and they will make the decisions for themselves While being careful to avoid causing inflation project researchers arrange homestays paying villagers for room board and laundry When hiring hunters as guides researchers offer a set bonus price for each animal they see National Geographic Expeditions Travel with National Geographic Search Trips We learn from them and we try to give back Costa says The hope she explains is that instead of starting destabilizing fires to flush game into traps for sustenance and illegal bush meat sale villagers will realize a live animal brings more benefit to the entire community Meet two young Botswanan men hoping for a new life in the modern world And after a while the village chief went to Costa with an idea What if he told his people to stop hunting in a nearby area with a lot of antelope He was sure the other animals would come back and the next time Costa visited they could go and see I almost cried Costa says CALL OF THE WILD For the urban billions who are tired nerve shaken and over civilized as John Muir put it nature can be the greatest antidote And while tourism can degrade wildernesses it can also sustain them Botswana s tourism industry is growing and its game reserves are the primary attraction The Moremi Game Reserve which comprises the majority of the Okavango Delta s protected areas hosts dozens of temporary camps accessible by air from the town of Maun Tourism revenues nearing half a billion annually help preserve the delta s pristine areas and provide a model for other countries like Angola looking to boost the economy without damaging the environment Learn how Botswana became a leader in conservation The team s mokoros traverse an oxbow bend of the Cuito River Much more slow moving than its cousin the Cubango the Cuito River seeps from a source lake through old peat bogs capable of absorbing up to times their own dry weight in water before forming a river Photograph by Cory Richards National Geographic For those hungering for a trip to find themselves in the wild Costa has some advice It s cheesy she warns but don t rush it Self awakening happens in a moment you re not expecting period As soon as you think Oh my god I have to awake you don t understand what s happening around you Instead she says Be present Live it Stay there Understand where you are How do you belong in that system How are you part of it What can you do to be part of it Whether it s New York or the Okavango the wild is there Explore travelers top things to do in Botswana I think it s a human right to have the opportunity to go into a truly wild place Boyes says Once you experience that it s always with you People ask me Don t you miss it Don t you want to be out there Doesn t it feel strange to be here in the city No he tells them I m still there It s with me all the time I close my eyes I m there As long as you re in the present moment you can touch a leaf on a tree and feel it It s hardwired into all of us I had a wilderness experience yesterday he says walking on the waterfront in Vancouver Gulls crows pigeons it s exactly the same It s no different That s life on earth The Okavango Wilderness Project begins the Cuando Source Lakes and River Transect in May Learn how you can support the Project here Related See More Pictures of the
