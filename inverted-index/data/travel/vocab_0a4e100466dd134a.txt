eBooks Download instantly and read any time Explore all products Travel Stories USA New York City Share The best day spas in New York City Rachel Chang Dec min read Share New York City is full of wonderful spas to help you escape the rush of the city Here are the best Shibui Spa Thereâ s an energy in New York City that fuels the spirit with its never ending momentum But even that constant boost requires hitting the pause button now and then to reset and recalibrate the soul Thatâ s why finding the right spa experience can be the key to balance whether youâ re visiting for the first time or you re a lifelong New Yorker As with everything in the Big Apple the wellness scene is constantly growing and aiming for the most innovative and inventive immersive experiences Whether youâ re seeking a sauna experience like the European communal traditions a luxurious solo treatment or even a group class that involves an ice bath dip with strangers â thereâ s something for every type of spa goer Here are a few of my favorites Advertisement At this reimagined textile factory you can enjoy a traditional spa experience Aire Ancient Baths Aire Ancient Baths Tribeca and Upper East Side Best for ancient traditions Ever since Aire Ancient Baths â s first location in Seville opened in the brand has established a reputation for spa oases in candlelit spaces reminiscent of bath traditions from Roman and Greek times As proof of their dramatic settings the Tribeca location debuted in in a repurposed textile factory while a new Upper East Side outpost in a former square foot Museum of Modern Art MoMA storage facility is scheduled to open in the upcoming weeks with a saltwater bath hanging from the ceiling as its piece de resistance The most standard experience Ultimate Bath allows for minutes of free time taking dips between the pools of varying temperatures Packages combined with massages and an array of body and facial treatments are also available The Tribeca location also has its own Signature Wine Experience that includes a private soak in a wine bath for minutes â why raise a glass when you can take a dip in it Planning tip Bathing suits are mandatory so donâ t forget to bring yours The spa will lend you a towel and non slip shoes for use during your visit Reservations must be made in advance and youâ ll need to choose the exact service upon booking Enjoy views of New York City while relaxing in The QC NY heated pool The QC NY The QC New York Governors Island Best with a ferry commute With views of the Manhattan skyline from its outdoor pools QC New York on Governors Island just debuted a second building this fall a square foot facility with waterfalls lavender and ice rooms a relaxation room with waterbeds plus a bistro and bar All together the square foot sanctuary has turned this slice of New York City into a dream island getaway â just a five minute ferry ride from Downtown Visitors pay one entrance fee for access to more than spa experiences like saunas steam rooms and relaxation spaces as well as outdoor pools and gardens Planning tip A dynamic pricing structure for admission means your arrival time determines the cost I saw admission ranging from to per person for three hours with the option to upgrade to a visit without a time limit Sunset and after dark entries are discounted In addition to a bathing suit bring sunglasses and sunscreen for the outdoor spaces Othership Flatiron Best for community building Advertisement One part sauna one part ice bath one part group meditation class one part community event Othership is a wellness experience like no other In the Flatiron facility classes kick off with a sauna session where guides lead guests through calming exercises mixed with ceremonial performances Then theyâ re led through a quick shower rinse before entering a room filled with ice baths that fit two people Participants are encouraged to immerse themselves for two minutes which is more than enough time for it to become a true bonding experience Back in the sauna the group then debriefs on the shared experience organically building a community through the joint adventureâ and feeling lighter and brighter Planning tip Othership which made its US debut this summer after two successful Toronto locations offers three types of experiences Classes are the most structured whereas free flow sessions allow for more flexibility and the social ones have more of a party vibe First timers may want to start with a class to get a lay of the land and guidance in a group setting Bring a bathing suit and water bottle For a more affordable but still luxurious experience head to Bathhouse Bathhouse Bathhouse Flatiron and Williamsburg Best for an unlimited stay While New York City spa experiences often hit three digit price tags Bathhouse offers all the sleek spa house accouterments â thermal pools steam rooms saunas and a cold plunge â but at a reasonable rate At the Williamsburg location early bird and night owl rates start at and weekday rates from while at Flatiron early rates start at and night at with weekday day passes from Hammam scrubs and massage treatments are available as an add on while the Bathhouse Experience encompasses a minute full body massage and minute scrub starting at With an emphasis on sharing a relaxing dip with others Bathhouse invites guests to push thermal limits as sitting in a sauna or cold bath can most definitely do The best part here thereâ s no time limit once you enter so the stress of watching the clock also melts away Planning tip Weekday visits generally save at least compared to weekend ones Bring a bathing suit and water bottle as well although thereâ s also a cafe with snacks and drinks for an extra fee Choose from a number of fantastic rejuvenating treatments at Shibui Spa Shibui Spa Shibui Spa Tribeca Best for calming treatments Tucked inside the Greenwich Hotel is an understated space where aesthetics are simple yet thoughtful and the worries of the concrete pounding simply melt away That in fact is exactly the meaning of the Japanese concept of shibui a refinement that sits between simplicity and tradition Decked out in wood stone and water â Shibui Spa subtly offers an invitation to connect and seek balance with nature The five treatment rooms have facials massages and body treatments as well as aromatherapeutic soaks followed by mindfully curated treatments including ones focused on healing and balance The facility also includes a heated pool relaxation lounge and changing areas with steam and rain showers Planning tip As a more intimate facility book early especially for weekend spots especially since hotel guests get a priority during peak times Better yet turn it into a full fledged staycation by combining it with a stay in one of the rooms and dining at the in house Locanda Verde the Italian taverna co owned by Robert Deniro Experience a day at the iconic hotel before indulging in luxury at The Guerlain Spa The Guerlain Spa Guerlain Spa Midtown Best luxury mainstay Le belle vie With roots way back to the French fragrance and beauty brand has long been the beacon of luxurious self care Combined with the storied history of New York Cityâ s most famous hotel The Plaza Hotel â itself with roots back to â this is a timeless experience with a Parisian twist located on the iconic propertyâ s fourth floor Make a day out of it by starting with a stroll through Central Park before your treatment Donâ t miss the Gapstow Bridge over the pond in this corner of the park Then indulge in the services ranging from facials and massages to waxing and makeup â or even choose from a trio of all day experiences with focuses on energy boost anti aging and prenatal Top it all off with an iconic Plaza experience whether itâ s afternoon tea in the Palm Court or a glass of bubbly in the Champagne Bar Then go for some retail therapy browsing the Fifth Avenue shops Planning tip The spa recommends arrival further in advance than most others â a half hour before appointment times The idea is to get fully oriented and settled before sinking into the treatments Also note that a service charge will be added to all treatments and packages but can be adjusted upon request Sojo Spa Club New Jersey Best for a day trip Across the Hudson River an enclave around Edgewater and Palisades Park in New Jersey has long been known for its Korean spas each like a Disneyland of saunas with themed rooms While King Spa Sauna has been my go to for the greater part of two decades Sojo Spa Club brought a modern and fresh take when it opened in The massive square foot facility is spread across eight floors surprisingly just across from a strip mall with a Trader Joe s as a wellness playground with one stunning amenity after another Weâ re talking an infinity pool with a NYC skyline view hydrotherapy pool a foot massage pathway saunas with salt clay and charcoal outdoor pools from water thatâ s silky to another thatâ s a Hinoki natural antibacterial bath and â should you really be thinking about work in the midst of all this â a coworking space as well An on site Hotel SoJo is open for stays on Friday and Saturday nights Planning tip Located in Edgewater New Jersey the spa has a free parking lot on the next block as well as on site valet services for a car Rideshare services should drop off around the corner on Vreeland Terrace to avoid the busy traffic on River Road Public transportation is also available via NJ Transit from Port Authority Bus Terminal on the
