life has proved to be the source of a contentious debate with activists who argue it is unethical and results in the death of nearly five million goldfish each holiday Last year Iranian President Hassan Rouhani tweeted a Norwuz photo of his haft seen but instead of a goldfish in a bowl Rouhani placed an orange inside It all ends with a picnic On the day of the new year celebrations spill outside for Sizdah bedar picnics which in Iran means almost the entire country feasts together along nearby riverbanks On this particular day families often will dispose of many items from their haft
