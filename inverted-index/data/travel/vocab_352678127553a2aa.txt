By James Stewart April This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Noctourism or the recent trend of exploring the world after dark is set to transform how night owls see the world in In a Booking com survey last year nearly two thirds of respondents across countries said they were considering holidays with experiences at night from stargazing and safari sleep outs to after dark city tours Luxury tour operator Wayfairer Travel reports nocturnal excursions were up by in It s taken off in the past year CEO Jason Stevens says Lee Thompson co founder of tour operator Flash Pack says demand among millennial travellers increased by We ve noticed a growing demand for non alcoholic experiences in recent years People now crave unique experiences beyond evenings in a bar which seems to have fuelled noctourism Perhaps the real reason is simpler In an age of overtourism when few parts of the globe are still unvisited noctourism can provide a new perspective on established sights It s a chance to rediscover a world transformed at night Here are some of the best nocturnal adventures to try Safaris by night The average African safari in the daytime typically only sees around of mammals with around of them nocturnal among them the bush baby and the honey badger It s no surprise then that there s been a rise in demand for night time wildlife trips Dan Free general manager of Wildlife Worldwide says Guests increasingly want to see more unusual species The company has a new South Africa trip to see niche nocturnal mammals such as the aardvark and aardwolf Wayfairer Travel reports a rise in demand for night safaris in Africa compared to CEO Jason Stevens suggests wildlife documentaries are the inspiration Rainforest lodges are also increasingly running night time wildlife walks in destinations such as Madagascar and Costa Rica Meanwhile those on the Amazon such as Sacha Lodge in Ecuador already provide canoe trips to see the eyes of cayman glowing in torchlights In Europe wildlife specialist Travelling Naturalist is using overnight hides to spot brown bears each June while Amazing Nature Scandinavia runs camps in a wolf pack area to hear the animals howls Increasingly watching wildlife in their natural habitat no longer relies on daylight The Northern Lights For anyone keen to explore after dark the Northern Lights are typically at the top of their list of must sees According to the most recent figures in the Northern Lights industry was valued at while in December last year the Association of British Travel Agents ABTA found that one in five UK holidaymakers was planning a trip to a region where they d have a chance of seeing the aurora up on Meanwhile according to figures from aviation analytics company Cirium seasonal flights to Tromsø Norway s Northern Lights capital rose from in operated by just Norwegian and Wizz Air to a total of last year with British Airways EasyJet and SAS all launching new routes It s clear that interest in the aurora is surging That s partly due to the Northern Lights solar maximum in and when a peak in solar activity creates a bonanza for aurora spotters resulting in more frequent and stronger sightings But the light phenomenon also capitalises on another recent trend noctourism As Tom Kerss chief aurora chaser of Norwegian cruise operator Hurtigruten says They re the closest thing to real magic you can find in the natural world But they can be elusive and not all travellers come away with a confirmed sighting with a combination of aspects such as poor weather and luck sometimes scuppering chances Aurora Zone the UK s oldest Northern Lights tour operator offers Scandinavia holidays within the hotspot of degrees north to degrees north Managing director Amy Hope says that of its customers witnessed the aurora last season partly thanks to its camps being located well away from light pollution Yet like all operators it hedges its bets by including other activities on trips Some companies offer a Northern Lights promise whereby guests qualify for a repeat trip if they re among the unlucky ones For passengers on board a Hurtigruten cruise for example this translates to a free seven day voyage if the aurora fails to materialise during cruises that last more than days Demand for its Astronomy Voyages which feature expert lecturers almost doubled from to Bookings by January had also already surpassed last year s total Kerss says Quite simply the ship becomes a floating observatory constantly moving to chase the clearest skies Australia offers excellent stargazing

sense of connection says Chris McIntyre founder of Expert Africa He believes safari star beds set beneath epic skies with a soundtrack of whooping hyenas provide a blend of tranquillity and exhilaration deepening your connection to the wild Though pioneered by early African safaris comfort levels have changed radically McIntrye says We ve seen a big increase in interest for star beds A decade ago a high end sleep out meant a foam mattress and a duvet now you have king size beds with the best linens Basecamp Samburu in Kenya launched four deluxe star beds this year elevated under canopies and each with their own hot tub The Maldives has been quick to embrace the concept as well From this year guests at Milaidhoo in Baa Atoll can book a Sleep Under the Stars experience a bed on a private sandbank accessible only by boat In the Swiss tourist board also launched the Million Stars Hotel concept Booked through wild camping platform Nomady the project lists around unique stays that offer spectacular night sky views from geodesic domes to mattresses on a farmer s hay cart Stargazing trips With worldwide light pollution growing annually and the Milky Way already invisible to a third of the world s population starry skies have become a reason to travel says Robert Massey deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society People want an experience that s hard to get at home Massey s pick of stargazing destinations includes the COAA observatory in the Algarve where amateur astronomers have the opportunity to use the telescopes and the light pollution free landscapes of Chile Namibia and the Australian Outback All have extraordinary clear skies which is why they re home to observatories he says Global non profit DarkSky International has certified over miles as dark sky sites worldwide generally as Dark Sky Reserves and Dark Sky Parks The Tāhuna Glenorchy Dark Sky Sanctuary near Queenstown in New Zealand is a addition The reserves in the UK have also led travel operators to embrace stargazing In the Lake District the hotel Another Place runs full moon stargazing swims with a cold water expert providing wetsuits and tow floats while in Dorset

Treasury illuminated by thousands of lanterns The Taj Mahal in India also opens for five days around the full moon for just people at a time offering a whole new perspective on the site Wayfairer CEO Jason Stevens says of visitors to Tokyo up on are increasingly seeking night time experiences Instagram has been a huge driver of this in my opinion because users see images of neon signs in Shinjuku s Kabukicho or tiny izakayas bars in Omoide Yokocho and want to experience it He recommends visiting Senso ji after dark to see Tokyo s oldest temple at its quietest plus nocturnal cruises along the Sumida River Food markets are often hubs for nocturnal activity especially in East Asia and Latin America where you go to people watch as much as to eat Inside Asia runs food themed trips which
