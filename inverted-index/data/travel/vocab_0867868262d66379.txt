Want to see the real Paris Walk this way The Palace of Versailles the Royal Chapel pictured here is one suburban highlight accessible via an extensive trail system in Paris France Photograph by MARTIN BUREAU AFP Getty Images TRAVEL BEST OF EUROPE Want to see the real Paris Walk this way Stretching more than miles the Greater Paris Trail highlights the city s myriad facets from architectural showstoppers to everyday treasures far from crowds By Mary Winston Nicklin June min read Each year millions of visitors flock to Paris with itineraries centered on a three mile stretch along the Seine River flanked by renowned monuments Notre Dame cathedral the Louvre the Eiffel Tower But there s much more to the French capital than such familiar postcard sights Greater Paris with a population of million is one of the biggest cities in Europe As such it offers a world of discovery beyond the Boulevard Périphérique the ring road completed in that has become as much a mental barrier as a thoroughfare shrinking Paris to a Seine centric perspective A project called the Sentier du Grand Paris Greater Paris Trail helps break down this barricade enlarging the map to suburban places often overlooked or misunderstood by both visitors and locals Inaugurated in after three years of mapping this network of urban hiking trails now stretches more than miles in stages or sections throughout greater Paris each designed as a day hike Josephine Bonaparte s Château de Malmaison now a museum is located in the western branch of the Greater Paris Trail outside central Paris Photograph by Alain Poirot Alamy Stock Photo Detailed in a French guidebook and the Avenza Maps app the sections are in the shape of a clover and easily accessed by metro and suburban RER trains In fact the Sentier s creation coincides with the ambitious public transport expansion known as the Grand Paris Express slated for completion in at an estimated cost of billion euros The trail was the brainchild of a philosophical quartet Jens Denissen urbanist and landscape designer Denis Moreau artist Baptiste Lanaspeze book publisher and Paul Hervé Lavessière urbanist geographer As part of Metropolitan Trails the project aims to create a new type of public space an open air cultural center via urban hiking Walking is both a way of discovering a place and also being part of its fabric explains Denissen who s led collective public walks in the suburbs since With a sense of curiosity and observation the walker can perceive the extraordinary in the ordinary It s a process of permanent exploration As a Paris resident I ve embraced walking as both a pastime and practicality But I had never kept hiking beyond the beltway Walking portions of the Sentier over the course of several months I discovered that the trail prompts us to rethink the long standing historical narrative about Paris origin story on the Île de la Cité the island in the Seine where the Romans established the city of Lutetia atop a settlement built by the Parisii tribe After the archeological discovery of a prominent Celtic site in Nanterre some scholars argue that the Celtic capital was not in present day Paris but in today s suburbs A walk through history On each hike I traversed the centuries the Sentier illuminating a cross section of French history and society Place names themselves allude to antiquity the river Marne has Celtic origins as does Créteil later absorbed into Latin under the Romans I saw a mosaic of landscapes peopled by diverse communities and studded with innovative architecture from the Palace of Versailles century to architect Emile Aillaud s noodle like Les Courtillières housing complex in Pantin Here s how gardeners restored Marie Antoinette s secret Versailles garden On Stage I explored the medieval Chateau de la Madeleine a fortified hilltop castle overlooking Chevreuse village and the bucolic countryside On Stage I learned about the transformative effects of industrialization on what had been a major hub in the Middle Ages through sites like Basilica Saint Denis People walk in front of Basilica Saint Denis at sunset The final resting place of France s royal rulers is one of many stunning sights in the Sentier s northern section Photograph by Bruce Yuanyue Bi The centuries old necropolis for the French monarchs was the birthplace of Gothic architecture and the inspiration for Notre Dame cathedral Even earlier the fertile Plaine Saint Denis was an important gathering place for Celtic tribes Historically it was central and now it s been marginalized explains Denissen On Stage I walked sidewalks Marne side footpaths beneath weeping willows and even pedestrian tunnels under autoroutes to discover the École du Breuil Tucked at the eastern end of the Bois de Vincennes park this century training academy for the city s gardeners holds magnificent gardens facing the Paris Arboretum with hundreds of tree species But Stage became my favorite I began the day at Josephine Bonaparte s Château de Malmaison the lovely country estate the empress shared with Napoleon Following the Seine I passed the shuttered paper factory once famous for printing Le Petit Parisien the world s biggest circulation newspaper with copies in now being converted into an eco friendly business district called the Campus Arboretum Parisians want to recover a legendary river now buried under concrete From Nanterre University the heart of France s student uprising the path leads through the Parc André Malraux constructed in on what had been a slum inhabited by Algerian workers and concludes at the monumental Grande Arche in the skyscraper bastion of La Défense An extension of the historic axis of Paris just to the west of the Arc de Triomphe this arch a window open to the world took workers four years to build It was inaugurated in for the anniversary of the French Revolution Mapping the megalopolis During the surveying process the step before plotting the map the Sentier s founders worked with local communities to ascertain the best route and sites to include It wasn t just a line on a map explains Denissen An important dimension was the story of the people we met along the way We called it the grande caravane Lavessière says of the survey process It had morphed to include photographers journalists and sound designers who embarked on two day expeditions to trace hypothesized sections of the Sentier testing and modifying the route as they went Two people in a rowboat enjoy an afternoon in Lac Daumesnil an artificial lake in Bois de Vincennes park Hikers can pick up the Sentier on the eastern edge of the park where it traverses the Paris Arboretum Photograph by Olivier DJIANN Getty Images The first version of the map was a triangle connecting Saint Denis Creteil and Versailles It was enlarged to include the five so called Villes Nouvelles New Towns symbols of the region s century urban development representing the dawn of Greater Paris A utopian effort to create self functioning cities in the suburbs and thereby contain sprawl the New Towns were linked by the newly built RER trains The final Sentier map is shaped like a trilobe the three interlocking arcs paying homage to both the Celtic origins of Paris and medieval Gothic architecture found along the route Soon the Sentier team will create trail links into the heart of Paris at Châtelet Les Halles a central train hub connecting several lines There s hope that signage despite the administrative challenges could eventually be added on the trails Along the way the Sentier exalts the history of hiking culture by crossing other paths including the Grande Randonnée GR routes that traverse France We make an open door to existing trails as a tribute to the hike and its history Hiking was invented in the century as a way of getting out of the industrial city by community groups like Les Excursionnistes in Marseille who would go to the Calanques a national park says Denissen The Sentier builders also found inspiration in century figures such as American land artist Robert Smithson who organized guided industrial tours of New York and the Stalker collective which began exploring the abandoned wastelands around Rome in the Learn about the revolutionary idea behind America s urban trails The real Paris Over time as Paris grew it externalized its functions defensive fortifications in war agricultural fields for food and death itself as graveyards were moved outside the city limits As such the Sentier doesn t shy away from the industry and infrastructure that has made Paris what it is today the highways Napoleon s canal system the factories There s a philosophical approach in encouraging walkers to rekindle the connection to what s around us In some ways it s also political Walking is a way of taking care of this land raising consciousness of hidden natural areas pondering how to protect fertile fields from mega development says Denissen It was under Baron Haussmann in the century that urban planning incorporated reflection about the city s metabolic life a new sewer system channeled wastewater to fertilize fields on the Plaine Saint Denis while aqueducts carried fresh water from sources far away Find out how this coal region transformed itself into an oasis of green tourism One fine spring day on the Sentier I found myself walking for the first time next to the Vanne Aqueduct south of Paris In its design engineer Eugène Belgrand was inspired by ancient Roman aqueducts a straight stone conduit channeling water for more than miles from Burgundy The aqueduct slices through the landscape much like the trains speeding Paris bound passengers through the ride over country of the suburbs But on that day I was in no hurry as I strolled alongside the looping stone arches of the century landmark Flowers and plants had taken root beside it yet another example of how beauty history and industry merge on these trails Mary
