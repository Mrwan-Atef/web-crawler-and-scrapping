Regis St Louis Feb min read Share The beach below the town of Carvoeiro in the Algarve region of Portugal Inacio Pires EyeEm Getty Images The Algarve hits all the right notes Inviting beaches in this part of southern Portugal suit surfers sun loungers and everyone in between Castles lord over cliff top towns and wild stretches of coastline meet the horizon With brilliant sunshine as the most likely weather forecast deciding when to visit is just about as simple as picking the soonest possible date and figuring out who can join you and what you want to do Families can set up in a child friendly locale for a seaside holiday Couples on a romantic getaway can sneak down cobblestone lanes for nights of soulful music Solo travelers can ramble on rugged paths cut above sandstone bluffs As you plan your visit add these top places to your itinerary Advertisement Surfers near Sagres PIXEL to the PEOPLE Shutterstock Sagres Best for surfing The westernmost town in the Algarve Sagres has some of Portugalâ s most spectacular scenery At the centuries old Fortaleza de Sagres you can walk to the edge of sheer sea cliffs and watch the waves crashing far below According to legend Sagres was where Prince Henry the Navigator founded his school for sailors instruction included cartography ship design astronomy and of course navigation in the century ushering in the Age of Discovery Some say the best viewpoint in the Algarve lies just a few kilometers north at Cabo de SÃ o Vicente Europeâ s southwesternmost point There a lonely lighthouse overlooks the jagged wind whipped cape These days Sagres continues to look to the sea although now it is more often in search of great waves to thrill the surfers assembled at the popular breaks or perhaps for leaping cetaceans to delight passengers on a dolphin watching cruise Planning tip The village itself is smaller and quieter than towns in the central Algarve but if you want some action you ll find it at the terrace bars and restaurants along the main drag of Rua Comandante Matoso The neoclassical Arco da Vila in Faro mariajuarez Shutterstock Faro Best for history Many travelers fly into Faro and quickly depart for resorts to the east and west Unfortunately theyâ re missing one of the Algarveâ s most intriguing towns with a cobblestone center thatâ s packed with history You can feel the hands of time spin backward as you pass through the neoclassical Arco da Vila to enter the walled medieval quarter Up ahead the SÃ cathedral has presided over the town since at least the century though possibly longer as it was likely built on top of a Roman temple Only a few of the original elements remain â the rest was rebuilt in a mishmash of Gothic Renaissance and baroque styles after the devastating earthquake Planning tip Make time to climb the cathedral s tower for views over the town then complete your time traveling journey with a visit to Museu Municipal a domed century landmark that was once the epicenter of the Jewish quarter Advertisement Benagil Caves near Carvoeiro Claudia Wermelinger Getty Images Carvoeiro Best for families with kids Backed by whitewashed houses and sandstone cliffs the beach at Carvoeiro is lapped by calmer seas and watched over by lifeguards which make it a great choice for families Just uphill from the golden sands the village has a walkable center and outdoor restaurants that will please kids and adults alike More stunning beaches dot the coast a short distance from town including Praia do Vale Centeanes a perfect spot for building sandcastles Planning tip Carvoeiro is the launchpad for a wide range of tours including boat trips to the Benagil Caves a cathedral sized sandstone cavern lit by sunlight streaming through a hole high overhead Walk the walls of Silves Castle Caio Pederneiras Shutterstock Silves Best for inland exploring Itâ s hard to turn your back on the sea given those golden sands and aquamarine views But thatâ s indeed the best strategy if you hope to discover this delightfully attractive town Just miles from the ocean Silves occupies an idyllic hillside on a bend of the Rio Arade At its picturesque castle you can walk the ramparts and wander through exhibitions that describe the invasions and occupations over the centuries Afterward settle in on the terrace at CafÃ InglÃªs for refreshments and on Sunday afternoons live music Along the Rio GilÃ o in Tavira Juampiter Getty Images Tavira Best for culture wine and music Itâ s easy to fall for Tavira a truly captivating town This former Roman settlement displays its history with pride with the old quarter a hilltop castle and its elegant seven arched Ponte Romana span over the Rio GilÃ o actually a century reconstruction of the original bridge by Roman engineers You can learn about cultures of the past at NÃºcleo IslÃ mico which holds a small collection of century pieces from the town s period under Islamic rule Planning tip Tavira is the best place in the Algarve to learn about Portugalâ s deep rooted music traditions At Fado com you can hear live fado a soulful style of music best described as the Portuguese blues followed by a wine tasting â featuring vineyards of the Algarve of course Lagos Best for dining and nightlife One of the Algarveâ s liveliest destinations Lagos has a lot going for it Thereâ s plenty to see around town starting with its historic architecture baroque churches a century fortress and the old town walls The beaches nearby draw even more admirers particularly Praia de Dona Ana a standout spot in the Algarve When the sun goes down Lagosâ allure only increases Restaurants along cobblestone streets and hidden in backyard gardens like the Michelin listed Artistas fill with diners feasting on fresh off the boat seafood The evening continues at microbrew bars and cocktail lounges tucked along narrow lanes Take in the scene on the rooftop terrace of Bon Vivant or join the party people in the dance club below Cycling on the coast near Carrapateira Enrique DÃ az Getty Images Carrapateira Best for wild beauty The west coast of the Algarve is a rugged landscape of cliff backed beaches and wild vegetation As part of the Costa Vicentina which continues up into the Alentejo this chunk of the Algarve has some delightful towns where you can stay while exploring the pristine coastline Peaceful Carrapateira lies on a headland near two photogenic beaches without a building in sight Planning tip Before heading out on coastal walks or surfing the waves visit the Museu do Mar e da Terra da Carrapateira an endearing ethnographic museum with photos depicting traditional lifestyles over the years in Carrapateira GalÃ Best for couples The quiet village of GalÃ is one of the best places in the Algarve for a romantic getaway The townâ s beach Praia da GalÃ is an obvious choice for a day on the waterfront and even more secluded spots like Praia das Salamitras are a short hop from town GalÃ has some lovely B Bs and guesthouses including the high end Vila Joya with its double Michelin starred restaurant Planning tip Donâ t miss the sunset from beach facing Pedras Amarelas be sure to reserve a table on the terrace
