Brendan Sainsbury Mar min read Share Alaska is the gateway to the wilds but it pays to do some prep before you step off on the trails Â Menno Boermans Getty Images Alaska is bigger colder and more remote than any other state in the US Pure raw unforgiving and humongous in scale it is a place that calls to those with wanderlust and a strong sense of independence There are thrilling adventures to be had here but also pitfalls to be avoided Take precautions but donâ t let the wilderness spook you Few other places in the US allow you to scale an unclimbed mountain walk where â quite possibly â no human foot has trodden before or sally forth into a national park that gets fewer annual visitors than the International Space Station Here are some tips on how to plan and survive a trip to the great north of America Advertisement Book early if you want views like this Â Patrick J Endres Getty Images Early birds get better accommodation Alaska s summer season is relatively short May to September and places to stay fill up quickly Book accommodation at least two months in advance especially in smaller towns where choices are limited The same goes for campgrounds â you won t be the only one looking for a pitch in peak season Book excursions early too Other big ticket items can also get overbooked That multi day kayaking trip you were keen on The fly in bear spotting excursion youâ ve been dreaming about since Christmas Book â em up before May to avoid disappointment Bring an eye mask for summer nights In high summer it barely gets dark in Alaska particularly in the far north If youâ re a sensitive sleeper bring an eye mask Hotel rooms have curtains but tents donâ t Renting a car It might not be necessary A large proportion of Alaska is off the road network so a rental car isn t always an advantage Ferries connect the far flung towns of the Alaska panhandle we can help you plan your ferry trip Prince William Sound and the Alaska Peninsula while bush planes are the only way to reach the remote road less expanses of the north and west The Alaska Railroad will get you to the gates of the stateâ s two most popular national parks Denali and Kenai Fjords and once you get to the parks busses will get you around We can t recommend the railroad enough If you re curious how to see Alaska by train check out Sarah Stocking s article on how to plan it There are even buses that do a relatively good job linking Anchorage and Fairbanks to places as far apart as Wrangell St Elias National Park Tok Chicken and Deadhorse on the Arctic Ocean You ll need at least a week in Alaska to do it justice Stay in Alaska for at least a week to get a taster in destination but days will give you a proper overview of the state Thatâ s enough time to take the Alaska Marine Highway from Bellingham WA to Skagway â one of the stateâ s great road trips â or to ride the rails from Fairbanks to Seward Totem poles offer fascinating insights into Native Alaskan culture Â dshumny Shutterstock Alaska s Native culture Indigenous people â who prefer to be called Alaska Natives â comprise around of Alaskaâ s population Many live in federally recognized villages and their culture varies widely Key communities include the Inupiat in the Arctic the Athabascans in the Interior the Aleutians in the Southwest and the Tlingit and Haida in the Panhandle to name but a few Sadly a disproportionate number of Native Alaskans live below the poverty line Advertisement The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act gave Alaska Native corporations and villages title rights to million acres of land â that might sound substantial but it s only about one tenth of the state Due to Alaskaâ s isolation and late colonization the state harbors just one native reservation the Metlakatla Indian Community on Annette Island just south of Ketchikan Viewing totem poles will also give you some insights into the Native culture of Alaska Emblematic of the people of the southeast coast and British Columbia these zoomorphic sculptures are loaded with cultural historical and artistic significance Youâ ll find an abundance of totem poles in the southeastern panhandle particularly in Ketchikanâ s Saxman Village and Totem Heritage Center and Sitkaâ s National Historical Park Eating out is casual Restaurant food is often expensive in Alaska but eating out is casual and itâ s not usually necessary to pre book tables except at posher places in Anchorage and Juneau Meat and fish are staples outside of cities and large towns vegetarians and vegans may have less choice than they would in other parts of the US Inland or on the coast it pays to respect nature in Alaska Â James Courtney Forte Getty Images Pack practical dress rather than posh dress Alaska s weather can be unpredictable and the temperature and conditions can vary greatly with altitude and latitude Be sure to pack a warm fleece and waterproof jacket and leggings even in the summer Take a hat and gloves year round in the Far North and make sure your footwear is warm and durable with good grip Restaurants rarely have strict dress codes and Alaskans donâ t usually glam up for dinner Youâ re better off leaving the suit and high heels at home Some of the best bars are dives True there are plenty of hip micro breweries in Alaska but you canâ t really call yourself a bona fide sourdough old timer until youâ ve braved a beer in a dive bar full of grizzled locals sporting Klondike beards with a carpet that hasnâ t been cleaned since The crime question The Alaskan wilds are an environment to be taken seriously and Alaska s cities can sometimes be rough around the edges Alaska currently has the highest crime rate of any US state the most commonly reported cases being aggravated assault Violence against women is also depressingly widespread However in general crime is an urban phenomenon especially in Anchorage As a visitor from out of state itâ s unlikely youâ ll face too many issues if you follow basic common sense safety precautions stay vigilant and stick to well trodden routes in daylight hours Treat bears with respect and never get close to a mother with cubs Â Gleb Tarro Shutterstock See bears but from a safe distance Bears are everywhere in Alaska Black brown grizzly and polar bears are found from the frozen wastes of the Arctic tundra to the parks of metro Anchorage While you donâ t want to let a fear of bears limit your adventures itâ s important to heed a few basic warnings and minimize your chance of a dangerous close encounter If you do meet a bear on the trail do not turn and run â even if youâ re the worldâ s fastest sprinter you canâ t outrun a bear Stop dead make no sudden moves and begin talking calmly to the animal Most bear charges are bluffs with the animal veering off at the last minute If an encounter is imminent drop into a fetal position place your hands behind your neck and play dead If a bear continues biting you after you have assumed a defensive posture then you must fight back vigorously To minimize the chances of this happening itâ s highly advisable to carry bear spray if youâ re spending any time hiking or biking on trails Bears can show up unannounced anywhere â the heavily used Tony Knowles Coastal Trail in Anchorage is no exception Even joggers might want to consider investing in a strap on belt to carry a bear spray canister These defensive aerosol sprays contain red pepper extract Canisters cost to and are effective at ranges of but must be discharged downwind As you canâ t take bear spray on airplanes youâ ll need to stock up on arrival in Alaska All wild animals are unpredictable Bears arenâ t the only potentially dangerous animals You also need to be careful around moose cougars musk oxen elk wolves and other large animals As a general rule of thumb all wild animals are unpredictable â give them enough space and donâ t expect them to keep still and pose calmly for photos Hiking is just on a different scale in Alaska Â sunsinger Shutterstock Thereâ s a reason the mosquito is Alaskaâ s unofficial state bird Everything is bigger in Alaska even the mosquitoes The muskeg swamplands are full of them and theyâ re ferocious Bring repellent â and pick a brand with a high percentage of DEET Hiking is a different sport in Alaska Alaskaâ s backcountry can be brutal â bereft of phone reception light on even basic facilities and lashed by fickle often hostile weather Youâ ll need to pay extra attention to the conditions when making hiking plans Itâ s always best to hike in groups or with a friend If youâ re going it alone be sure to leave details of your itinerary with a responsible friend or a park ranger Always tell someone where you are going when you are leaving and when you plan to be back Some trails have sign in boards at the trailhead for added peace of mind Donâ t even contemplate a day hike without taking the backcountry basics â bear spray some method of water purification tablets or filter energy bars extra clothing whatever the weather and a mobile phone which can also act as a flashlight compass altimeter and route finder As any high school teacher will tell you itâ s best not to leave your homework until the last minute Read trail reports study maps research recent wildlife activity and investigate other potential pitfalls before setting out Ready
