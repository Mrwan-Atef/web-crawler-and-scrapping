Jungfraujoch Bernese Oberland Switzerland Attractions Lonely Planet Lonely Planet Destinations Planning Inspiration Shop Search Saves Open main menu JaCZhou Getty Images Jungfraujoch Switzerland Europe Top choice in Bernese Oberland Login Save This is the big one At above sea level Jungfraujoch is Europe s highest train station a once in a lifetime trip with views of the deeply crevassed Aletsch Glacier and a never ending ripple of sky high Alpine peaks to make you gasp out loud A little underwhelmingly for train enthusiasts the station itself is actually located inside the mountain in a tunnel of sorts But but the ride to reach it passes some magnificent mountain scenery with passengers glued to the window as the tracks curl past spruce forests and eyrie like villages meadows sprinkled with a confetti of wildflowers and mountains that glow pearl white in winter like a scene from a snowglobe The higher you go the more dramatic the journey gets shouldering up to glinting glaciers and the legendary triple act of Eiger Mönch and Jungfrau Upon completing the journey passengers disembark to explore the snowy surrounds We won t lie Jungfraujoch is no secret and it gets swamped in high season but with some cunning planning you can give the madding crowds the slip Stay overnight at the Mönchsjochhütte stomp through fresh powder snow in quiet exhilaration or take the first train to see sunrise pinken the peaks one by one and you too will feel the magic A view of the Jungfraujoch station and the Jungfraufirn glacier C E Seo Getty Images History of Jungfraujoch Only the Swiss had the guts more than a century ago to think you could blaze right through rock and ice and bore through the heart of Eiger to a glaciated peak high A masterpiece of engineering in the truest sense the railway has known few rivals since it launched on August taking some workers years to complete If the journey seems audacious now just think of how it seemed back then Many railway pioneers had flocked to the region and proposed ways to connect the highest peaks But it was Adolf Guyer Zeller who came up with the masterplan for the electrically operated cog railway factoring in several stops en route to let passengers enjoy the views The work on the railway began in earnest in and was carried out without machinery just shovels pickaxes and a hell of a lot of hard graft The construction was not without its hitches among them the sudden death of Adolf Guyer Zeller in and the accidental explosion of tons of dynamite in But these setbacks didn t stop Adolf s dream from becoming a reality The Ice Palace at Jungfraujoch FABRICE COFFRINI Getty Images What to do at Jungfraujoch Sphinx observation deck The icy wilderness of swirling glaciers and peaks that unfolds up top
