Dowrich Ryan Ver Berkmoes Dec min read Share You can enjoy the same beautiful beaches and lusciously warm blue waters as the big spenders and you can do so on a budget Â ajlatan Shutterstock With sands of varying hues of white pink brown and black lush green forests and tantalizing clear turquoise waters the Caribbean is the first choice of many to escape the bustle of life and soak in soothing nature However this collection of over islands has much more to offer than some R R The visual feast across the archipelago is layered upon the regionâ s rich history that will have you dancing in the streets to pulsating soca and reggae licking your fingers from freshly caught fish fried to perfection by street vendors and knocking back rum cocktails at all night bars When it comes to the Caribbean there is something for everyone The regionâ s diversity sets it apart from other destinations and despite their historical and cultural similarities each island offers a unique experience Advertisement You could soak in a hot spring in the untouched natural beauty of Dominica marvel at the preserved history of revolutionary Cuba transform into a costumed goddess at Trinidad Carnival or bask on the white sands of the famous Grace Bay Beach in sleepy Turks and Caicos As well as experiences the islands also differ in cost Traveling to the Caribbean can be an expensive venture with its all inclusive resorts especially during the high season when the region is in great demand Many islands cater to luxury travel but if you are a budget conscious traveler you too can enjoy everything the Caribbean has to offer It just calls for some careful planning lots of research and a sense of adventure Though Barbados is renowned for its snooty old clubs and resorts there are bargains to be had if you know where to look Â Getty Images Tetra images RF Know when to travel Avoid traveling to the Caribbean during the high season November to April as flight prices and accommodation are more expensive Prices are lower in both the low and shoulder seasons May June and September October when hotels may offer discounts and added incentives to lure travelers such as an extra night free or group specials Keep in mind that the fall months September and October tend to see heightened activity during the hurricane season that can pose tremendous danger to lives and infrastructure However islands such as Trinidad and Tobago and CuraÃ ao lie just outside of the hurricane belt and are good options to visit during this time Shop around for cheap flights Several airlines service routes between the Caribbean the United States Canada and Europe but the most important consideration when it comes to your budget is knowing when to book If there is a high demand event like Carnival taking place flights are more expensive and you need to book your ticket months in advance Carnivals happen year round on different islands so do your research on your chosen destination If you are flying from the US you can score cheap flights to destinations in close proximity such as The Bahamas Turks and Caicos the Cayman Islands and Puerto Rico You can fly from many UK airports to the Caribbean â some airlines only fly seasonally but British Airways and Virgin Atlantic fly year round adding and changing routes as necessary KLM and Condor fly from the Netherlands and Germany directly to islands such as Tobago and Barbados Check price comparison websites or work with a travel agent to get the best prices for your needs Find the cheapest Caribbean island to visit While Caribbean islands vary in affordability throughout the year several islands consistently rank among the most budget friendly Factors like airfare accommodation prices and the region s ever popular festivals can quickly drive up costs However by choosing your destination carefully you can avoid the sticker shock and still enjoy stunning scenic locations Consider visiting these affordable Caribbean islands which are known for being kind to your wallet while offering unforgettable experiences U S Virgin Islands By visiting the US Virgin Islands outside the peak winter season travelers can take advantage of budget friendly deals during the shoulder seasons more on this below As a US territory American tourists also benefit from avoiding currency conversion fees and international card charges making it an even more economical choice for a tropical getaway No passport is requiredâ just pack your bags for an affordable island escape Puerto Rico Another winner in the US territory category is the diverse and picturesque island of Puerto Rico During off season months in spring and fall its lower cost of living compared to other islands extends favor to hotel and vacation rental rates Airfare is another potential money saver for visiting Puerto Rico on a budget with the best deals allowing you to touch down for less than from major US cities Puerto Rico is also one of the Caribbeanâ s most underrated destinations with unforgettable highlights like El Yunque National Forest and sister islands Culebra and Vieques Dominican Republic The Dominican Republic gives travelers the best bang for their buck due to a low cost of living and wide selection of all inclusive stays Punta Cana the islandâ s most popular city is a hub of beachfront resorts and adventure activities Though the island is budget friendly throughout the year planning your visit between May and November is recommended to keep costs down as demand and prices increase significantly during winter and spring Just be sure you can live with the risk of storms and other weather issues in low season Advertisement Jamaica Jamaica is often celebrated for its luxury offerings but the island also has a budget friendly side At the heart of any Jamaican getaway is its rich culture and delicious cuisine making planning an affordable trip without sacrificing experiences easy All inclusive resorts are a great option as they typically include meals and daily activities offering two major opportunities to save while still enjoying great food and entertainment throughout your stay The Bahamas With over inhabited islands the Bahamas offers several budget friendly options for travelers While Nassau is a popular starting point for exploring the islands itâ s not always the most affordable choice For the best travel deals consider visiting lesser known islands like Andros Abaco and Cat Island especially between August and November Ditch the fancy restaurants Eating in the Caribbean does not have to be expensive From street food to fresh fruits and vegetables at markets cheap choices abound For less than you can enjoy anything from â hot doublesâ in Trinidad a spicy flatbread filled with chickpeas and delicious fried fish in the popular Oistins area in Barbados to a plate full of root crops such as cassava yam and dasheen with fish in Dominica and authentic â oil downâ in Grenada a delicious dish made with breadfruit and pigtails Attend free weekly fish fry events popular in Turks and Caicos where you can enjoy live music and an array of street food vendors or take a walking culinary tour in Puerto Rico where you can learn about the countryâ s history while enjoying several meals along the way Local festivals and carnivals are a wonderful way to experience an island s culture Â isitsharp iStockphoto Getty Images Immerse yourself in the local culture There are Carnivals taking place in the Caribbean almost every month of the year If you want to experience the distinct culture of an island planning a trip during one of those festivals is highly recommended The summer period â low season in the Caribbean â has a string of back to back Carnivals in St Vincent Grenada Barbados Antigua and Barbuda and St Lucia Once on the ground you can enjoy the activities without having to fork out a lot of money From the cost free spectacle of a costumed street parade or a visit to a pan yard to enjoy steel band orchestras rehearsing for their competitions to attending calypso and cultural shows for under per person there are a wealth of low cost cultural delights to enjoy Use local ferries to island hop on a budget Island hopping across the Caribbean is expensive and challenging due to a lack of daily flights However you can enjoy a relatively affordable island hopping vacation if you stick to particular areas Ferries and airlines operate bargain routes around island clusters mainly those in the northern Caribbean Express de Ã les for instance operates a ferry between four islands â St Lucia Martinique Guadeloupe and Dominica A round trip transfer between any two of these islands can cost around If you go to Trinidad you can hop over to Tobago via Caribbean Airlines for around for a round trip or on the inter island ferry for for a return sailing In St Kitts you can jump on one of the hourly sailings across to Nevis on either the ferry or the faster water taxi for under From Sint Maarten you can take the Makana Ferry to Saba Sint Eustatius or St Kitts for around return or book a Winair flight from Sint Maarten to a number of destinations in the vicinity If you go to St Vincent and the Grenadines you can easily hop around its smaller islands including Bequia or the picturesque Union island Cuba is the Caribbean s ultimate budget destination Â julianpetersphotography Shutterstock Look around for special offers on accommodation Just like airfares accommodation prices donâ t go down the closer you get to your travel date in high season Smaller hotels and guesthouses often have rate cards that don t change based on demand but large hotels and resorts do run all manner of specials that can mean big savings for those willing to commit many months before they plan to travel Here again the time you spend shopping online booking sites will pay off in savings Look for deals that include free meals excursions room upgrades and more Large resorts and online booking sites may also offer package deals that include airfare to the island These can offer great savings overall but not always Check the cost of flying separately so you can smartly evaluate package deals Be strategic with resorts Even if you found a great deal on resort accommodations it doesnâ t mean you have to do everything through the resort Think of the resort like your printer at home â it was sold cheap because the printer company makes its money selling you extras like ink cartridges The same applies to resorts â once they have you in the room they plan to make their profit by selling you pricey services and extras The resort activities desk is one big profit center Use an independent activities vendor out on the beach instead For tours look for online reviews of local residents offering trips that are more fun and more personable than the resort offerings Drink and eat independently That inviting beach bar or cafe is probably using the same rum in its drinks as the resort but charging much less The same goes for that seafood platter or oozing cheeseburger On most islands you can have a fabulous stay by going car free Â Dennis van de Water Shutterstock Look for alternative transportation There arenâ t a lot of islands with ride shares so when it comes to transportation moving around could be expensive if you depend on private taxis Renting a car is an option but the price of gas can be prohibitive Cut costs by using public transportation but always put your safety first and donâ t wear expensive or flashy jewelry and carry minimal cash If you love cycling there are islands such as Curacao Jamaica and Guadeloupe where you can rent bikes or go on cycling tours for under In Puerto Ricoâ s capital San Juan you can rent an electric scooter and tour the city for around Walking is also a great way to get to know a new city â take a stroll around downtown Havana and soak up its history Make the most of the great outdoors In the Caribbean you are spoilt for choice when it comes to natureâ s bounty While there are some beautiful beaches and spaces that you have to pay to access there are many others that are free Many islands have public beaches with easy access that cost nothing and you donâ t even need to spend money on a lounge chair â just spread your blanket on the sand and soak up the sun If you love hiking look for easy trails that wonâ t require a guide or look for cheap group tours that will take you to some scenic spots Daily costs Hostel room Basic room for two or more Self catering apartment or more Public transport ticket Coffee or tea Cheeseburger Dinner for two or more Beer at the bar Beach lounger rental Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere
