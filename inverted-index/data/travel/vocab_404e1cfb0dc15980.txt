the robust flavours of ripe tomato and heady oregano this is then combined with feta or mizithra cheese and chunks of barley rusk or sometimes carob rusk The carob tree whose fruit produces a malty and almost chocolatey flour among other products is an icon of Crete which is why some locals are campaigning for it to be inscribed on UNESCO s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage Crete is home to
