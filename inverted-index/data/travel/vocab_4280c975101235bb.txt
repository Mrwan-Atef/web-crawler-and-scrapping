a car probably Rely on two dependable mass transit systems the People Mover light rail loop and the Q Line electric streetcar line and you ll get easy access to Detroit s best downtown attractions buzzy restaurants and bars sports arenas and theaters Hart Plaza where the city s best festivals take place the Museum District Midtown shopping and the Detroit riverfront But if you plan to explore the wider city you ll need to rent a vehicle or book a car service Attractions like the Henry Ford Museum the Detroit Zoo Belle Isle State Park and the vast estates of the Fords and the Dodges are well worth venturing out for but they all require four wheels You ll want to make reservations for cocktails for dinner maybe even for lunch Downtown Detroit has become a magnet for food and beverage lovers thanks to its trendy and chef run restaurants and bars Dine at James Beard Award winning restaurants eat cuisines that span the globe drink at themed bars in The Belt and at semi secret speakeasies But first check to see if reservations are available and if so book your table in advance particularly if you re headed downtown Detroit is known for its music but this city is also a
