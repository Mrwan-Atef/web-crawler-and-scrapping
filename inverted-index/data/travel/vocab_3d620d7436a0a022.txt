Received Likes on Posts Kindest hotelier in the world Yesterday my granddaughter who was staying with us in Le Marche decided she wanted to go to Rome to see the funeral of Pope Francis Since it was a last minute decision it took a while to find a place to spend the night She did find and reserved a youth hostel on Hostel World near Termini station and took a train to Rome arriving at PM The hostel s listing said that check in was until PM but when she got there at she found it closed and no one answered when she rang She called the phone number and the person who answered said she would have to come back in an hour I had called her to see how things were going and she told me the story and said she would try to find a restaurant nearby to spend an hour The more I thought about this the less I liked it I called her back in minutes At that time she hadn t found a restaurant she could afford so she had got a snack and was walking around the area carrying a travel pack on her back By now I was horrified although she wasn t worried at all Maybe at her age I wouldn t have been worried either I remembered that once returning from the USA we had to wait six hours for our train home and were exhausted I had found a budget hotel the Teti hotel near Termini station that agreed to rent a room for four hours so we could rest The hotel was very basic but very clean and the proprietor went out of his way to accommodate us By now it was PM I called the hotel s number The proprietor actually remembered me He said that unfortunately the reception was closed and he wasn t on the premises but he would see what he could do He called me back in a few minutes and said he did have a room and would send my granddaughter the instructions for entering the hotel with a password and that he would take care of the formalities later He sent my granddaughter the location on Google maps He also called the adjacent restaurant and asked if someone there could meet my granddaughter and make sure she got in all right He sent a message to my granddaughter later to make sure everything had gone smoothly He asked her to send him a photo of her passport pages so he could stay on the right side of Italy s guest registration law I had said I would pay for the room which I did today Romans are often said to be unhelpful or even surly That has not been my experience at all I once had a waiter run after us to say there was a mistake on our bill and we had overpaid However this was beyond my experience a magnificent gesture of helpfulness and also trust I don t know if Fodorites are ever in search of a basic budget hotel near Termini station in Rome but if any of you are I highly recommend the Teti hotel https www booking com Share Reply bvlenci View Public Profile Send a private message to bvlenci
