Where to experience the midnight sun in Europe TRAVEL Where to experience the midnight sun in Europe Can t get enough of the long summer days Then head to these destinations where the sun barely sets The midnight sun phenomenon occurs in the northernmost parts of the Northern Hemisphere where destinations can experience hours of daylight Photograph by Vit Javorik Alamy By Priya Raj June This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Wrapped in mysticism folk beliefs and traditions midnight sun is a chance to see the world in a different light A phenomenon of constant daylight during summer in the northernmost parts of the Northern Hemisphere it can impart a reddish yellow or a pastel pink tint on the sky during dusk and dawn casting what feels like an otherworldly shroud over the world What is the summer solstice Here s what you need to know That magic is easily explained by science though Due to the annual rotation of the planet and the tilt of the Earth s axis the North Pole is directed towards the sun during the summer months which means increased daylight hours throughout the Northern Hemisphere In some destinations closer to the pole though the sun barely dips below the horizon or doesn t set at all creating an illusion of a never ending day It s a stark contrast to the polar night in winter some of these destinations get as little as a couple of hours of daylight during the winter months or no daylight at all meaning summer is high time for making the most of ample opportunities to enjoy the great outdoors If you re looking for a unique summer experience head to one of these six destinations where the day never ends Svalbard Norway The closer you get to the North Pole the more likely you are to experience true midnight sun and there s few places closer than Longyearbyen the world s northernmost permanent settlement Here the land revels in midnight sun for four months between April until August before the onset of darkness come winter This small arctic town doesn t offer much by way of extravagant celebrations but boasts adventures right on its doorstep from kayaking and boat trips to mountain hikes and snowmobile adventures in the mountains where snow still lingers reflecting the pastel coloured sky Many locals prefer to take advantage of the light evenings by sipping a cold Svalbard Bryggeri craft beer on the brewery s waterfront terrace while enjoying the sparkling ocean views Reykjavik is one of few cities with the midnight sun phenomena the warm hues in the night sky make this a magical time to visit Photograph by Stone RF Getty Images Reykjavik Iceland Iceland s capital might be one of few actual hour cities during summer as the sun doesn t truly set between mid May and mid July The further north in Iceland you go the shorter the night is but if you venture out to the small island of Grimsey which lies right on the border of the Arctic Circle you ll see constant daylight between June and July The seemingly endless days are perfect for exploring the wealth of natural wonders Iceland has to offer celebrate the longest day of the year by joining a family friendly night hike up to the summit of Mount Thorbjorn on June The warm hues of the midnight sun and less visitors make it one of the best times of the year to capture perfect shots of dramatic landscapes crowd free Swedish Lapland Many travellers might typically head for Sweden s fashionable capital Stockholm but between the end of May and middle of July it s the country s northernmost points you ll want to visit to take in the wonder of the midnight sun Here the sun dips just below the horizon each night painting the sky in vibrant pinks and oranges Hikers can scale Sweden s highest mountain Kebnekaise while those who prefer a more leisurely adventure should head to the Råne river valley for wild swims fishing and kayaking Alternatively experience the midnight sun from a different perspective by taking the minute chairlift up Mount Nuolja to the Aurora Sky Station Lofoten Norway Rather than the green and pink hues of the Northern Lights illuminating the skies the sun takes charge during the Norwegian summer For those who don t wish to travel as far as Svalbard the Lofoten archipelago is great for basking in near endless daylight between the end of May and mid July Adventurous visitors should head up one of the many peaks to see Lofoten under the rays of the midnight sun the mountain peaks Hoven at Gimsøy and Åndhammarn at Røst are challenging but especially rewarding If you d rather experience the

night sauna sessions followed by wild swimming is also a popular activity this time of year but note that the water only warms up after June If polar dips are too far out of your comfort zone stick to
