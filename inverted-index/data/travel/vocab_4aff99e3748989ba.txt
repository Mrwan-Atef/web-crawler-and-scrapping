read Share Here s what you need to know to get ready for a trip to Spain Luciano Mortula Shutterstock Spain has been home for the past years ever since I moved to its capital Madrid in my early From day one it was easy to be charmed by this warm and inviting country It ticks a lot of boxes in terms of what youâ re looking for in a European destination â great cuisine and wine spectacular landscapes architectural gems green spaces and a thriving art scene Getting around the country is also very convenient thanks to Spain s efficient and reliable multi modal public transport system And the Spanish people are some of the friendliest locals who will happily go out of their way to point you in the right direction if youâ re lost Of course there were still some cultural quirks I had to adjust to â for one eating times in Spain are very late in comparison with the rest of the world s dining schedules I still remember my early days in Madrid when my belly would be in outright rebellion while waiting for â earlyâ dinner reservations at And forget about making a speedy exit from social gatherings in Spain saying farewell could take up another hour of your time Cultural idiosyncrasies aside your trip to this incredible country can be your most memorable one yet if you plan well ahead and follow these useful travel tips Pack a coat for Spain unless it s the height of summer as it ll be cooler than you might expect Blake Horn for Lonely Planet Pack warm clothes Really There is a humorous Spanish expression that goes â Hasta cuarenta de mayo no te quites el sayoâ which translates to â Until the of May donâ t remove your coatâ â sage advice to keep a jacket handy until mid June While Spain may be famous for its blue skies and sun drenched beaches it actually has more colder seasons in the year than warm ones during early spring March to May autumn September to November and winter December to February Regions in northern Spain such as the Basque Country Asturias and Galicia have cooler temperatures compared to the rest of the country Being cashless is common Card is king in Spain The main tourist hubs such as Madrid Barcelona San SebastiÃ n and Ibiza are generally credit card friendly destinations In fact you could go cashless for days and pay for your meals drinks taxis and bus fares without a problem using a credit or debit card If you do bring cash make sure you have loose change Some establishments bus and taxi drivers especially on morning shifts usually do not have change for bigger bills So if you prefer paying cash itâ s a good idea to be stocked up on smaller bills â and â and coins Choose your time to visit Madrid wisely Think twice about visiting Madrid in August Most establishments in the Spanish capital close and MadrileÃ os usually head for the beaches to escape the brutal August heat The best way to stay connected Saily provides a hassle free solution to travel data â just choose your data plan and prepare for your trip When you get to your destination you can go online right away Get your eSIM Dinner isn t usually available before so plan your meals accordingly Getty Images Expect to eat late Prepare for late Spanish dining times Many tourists who come to Spain for the first time end up hungry while waiting for restaurants to open Most restaurants open for lunch from to and dinner from to A lot of establishments also close on Mondays You can stave off hunger pangs before mealtimes by snacking on tapas â small savory plates that are usually free with a drink order in many Spanish cities In San SebastiÃ n or Bilbao in the Basque Country you can savor pintxos or bite sized portions typically served on a slice of bread and skewered with a toothpick Ordering certain drinks will immediately mark you as a tourist A popular drink among tourists sangrÃ a is usually served in pitchers meant for sharing and not by the glass Instead try ordering a local favorite thatâ s similar to sangrÃ a tinto de verano a concoction of red wine and lemon soda Ask for a caÃ a like a local instead of a cerveza A caÃ a is a small glass of beer on tap about Tipping is not expected European countries in general donâ t have a tipping culture But of course it is very much appreciated â especially if you enjoyed good service Find a spot at a table at Mercado San Miguel in Madrid for your tapas and pintxos Shutterstock Don t eat food while youâ re on the move Eating is an age old pleasure that must be savored unhurriedly so itâ s very uncommon to see Spaniards biting sandwiches or munching on fries while walking down the street or riding public transportation Look for fixed price lunches Order the menÃº del dÃ a daily menu for lunch on weekdays Take your cue from the locals and ask for the fixed price menu ranging from â to â that includes a three course meal with dessert drinks bread and coffee Eat late stay late Make time for sobremesa â lingering long after a meal for a post dining conversation This is a hallmark of sociable Spanish culture to extend conversations well beyond mealtimes to be able to enjoy each otherâ s company for as long as possible usually over drinks Keep an eye on your belongings Be vigilant of pickpockets and keep your belongings close Pickpockets are unfortunately rampant in high tourist traffic areas in Spain If youâ re sitting at an outdoor table watch out for vendors that get suspiciously close and distract you with their items for sale such as flowers or lottery tickets while they surreptitiously steal your wallet or mobile phone on the table this is a modus operandi Iâ ve witnessed more than once You can drink tap water in Spain Go ahead and drink the tap water Spanish tap water or â agua de grifoâ is safe to drink though the taste varies across regions There s one number for an emergency Call for any emergency You can contact this number for any kind of emergency in Spain even without a Spanish SIM card on your mobile phone Youâ ll be connected to the right emergency service through multilingual operators To contact the Spanish National Police dial Beyond the beaches dress modestly in Spain especially visiting religious sites Mateusz Misztal Shutterstock Dress appropriately when away from the beach Opt for smart casual attire and avoid overly casual outfits like athleisure wear beachwear or excessively revealing clothing in the city If youâ re visiting religious sites such as churches cathedrals or mosques cover your shoulders and knees to show respect for these places Brush up on basic Spanish Like any destination it helps a lot if you know basic local phrases While you can get by speaking English in the bigger more touristy cities it is a different story when visiting smaller lesser known towns outside the tourist radar Don t say â no problemoâ which is incorrect The correct phrase is â no hay problemaâ or more colloquially say â no pasa nadaâ Know what is considered polite Greet people even strangers Itâ s commonplace to greet people in elevators shops and along hallways Compliment good service by saying â muy amableâ Meaning â very kindâ this is a commonly used polite phrase to express gratitude for someoneâ s helpfulness It can be said in different situations â if a person has gone out of their way to assist you like giving you directions holding a door or giving up their seat for you You can also say this to show your appreciation for customer service that goes above and beyond Donâ t leave a social gathering without saying goodbye It is generally frowned upon to leave an occasion without letting your host know However be prepared for a long drawn out goodbye â the Spanish are highly sociable people who like extending conversations leading to lengthy and often multiple stages of farewells Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Spain Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers Everywhere Follow us
