eBooks Download instantly and read any time Explore all products Travel Stories Italy Venice Share Venice on a budget Julia Buckley Jun min read Share Venice can be cheap if you know where to go Â LeoPatrizi Getty Images Is Venice overpriced In some ways sure but not in others The bad news is that hotels and restaurants tend to charge premium rates in this small city where thereâ s no room to build anything new and public transport tickets are eye watering But then thereâ s the good the main sights are free cheap bar snacks are nutritious and the city center is walkable meaning you only need to set foot on a vaporetto waterbus if youâ re heading into the lagoon So put aside what you may have heard â you absolutely can visit Venice on a budget â and you donâ t have to do it in an unsustainable way either Instead of being a â hit and runâ daytripper you can take your time in this magical city without breaking the bank Our local tips will help you find the cheapest way to travel to Venice on a budget Work out which airport is really the cheapest to fly to Veniceâ s airport Marco Polo sits north across the lagoon about by road or a straight shoot across the water Then thereâ s Treviso Airport a budget airline hub about or a minute drive north But those arenâ t your only choices thanks to the excellent and cheap railway system in this part of Italy Verona also a low cost airline base Trieste and even Bologna are viable options too if youâ re happy to get a train or bus for a couple of hours Winter in Venice may only be marginally cheaper but it can still be beautiful Â Simone Padovani Awakening Getty Images Visit in the depths of winter Unfortunately thereâ s no real off season in Venice these days but the second half of December through to Christmas and then New Year through to the start of Carnevale Venice Carnival whose dates vary every year but is usually late January or early February generally see the fewest tourists The downside is that some restaurants are closed in January Whatever time of year you go aim for midweek â weekends in particular see vast numbers of daytrippers Advertisement Calculate the best way into town â for you If youâ re flying into Marco Polo many people will tell you itâ s cheaper to get the coach into town â than the Alilaguna ferry â That might be the case â but it all depends on where youâ re staying The coach drops you at Piazzale Roma the vehicle terminus on the very outskirts of the city from there youâ ll likely have to get a vaporetto to your hotel which costs â for a single other options are available â see below However the Alilaguna ferries offer a range of routes and stops which will probably get you within walking distance of your hotel Check the map before you decide on the route Sometimes it s better to send in or near the city center in Venice Â Zu Sanchez Photography Getty Images Where you stay depends on what you do In a similar vein beware of false economies when choosing where to stay in Venice on a budget Yes itâ s often cheaper further out from the city center but if it means getting the vaporetto into town that can make the price rocket Staying on Giudecca or Murano for example means paying â every time you want to get off the island â and even the further afield parts of the sestieri six districts may mean you prefer to get a vaporetto into town rather than walk it Work out the whole cost before you book what looks cheapest at first In a similar vein accommodation on the mainland is usually cheaper â but you have to pay to come in first on a tram bus or train and then on the vaporetto Plus if youâ re concerned about making your visit sustainable pick somewhere where your money will stay in the fragile city not swill around on the mainland See if you can do without an Airbnb Many people have an image of Venice in their head as super expensive and automatically assume that booking an Airbnb will help keep costs down Not necessarily Airbnb prices are high here and groceries are artificially expensive since supermarkets have to pay to have them transported to the mainland then loaded onto a boat which means self catering isnâ t a bargain Venice restaurants are expensive but thereâ s an easy way to eat cheaply see below Once you add it all up a basic hotel can be better value Itâ s more ethical to stay in a hotel too â the explosion of Airbnbs and vacation rentals have decimated the housing market meaning many Venetians have had to leave the city Donâ t be part of the problem if you can help it Hostels and monasteries are another option â several of Veniceâ s many monasteries and convents rent rooms although thereâ s usually a curfew Eating cicchetti in Venice is good on the tummy and great on the wallet Â Pfeiffer Shutterstock Make the most of the bar food Venice is famous for its cicchetti â bar snacks that bear more than a passing resemblance to Spanish tapas Like tapas theyâ re varied enough to make a meal in themselves and you can order a platter of cicchetti for two for the price of a starter in a formal restaurant Most bars these days serve cicchetti as innovative toppings on thin slices of baguette While thatâ s fine for lunch if you want something more substantial for dinner try somewhere that offers a more varied selection such as Caâ dâ oro alla Vedova known for its sublime meatballs or Osteria Al Portego which has a great selection of seafood cicchetti Another lunch tip if youâ re wanting food on a budget tramezzini These overfilled sandwiches are delicious and perfect for lunch on the run Ttry local variations such as tuna with cipolline mini pickled onions Walk everywhere Because it is a complicated city itâ s easy to â readâ Venice through its vaporetto maps your hotel is two blocks from this stop the restaurant is a five minute walk from that one to get from the railway station to Zattere youâ ll need to take the boat all the way around the city Advertisement Actually though Venice is a small place and itâ s easy to walk everywhere apart from the islands Walking saves you the expensive vaporetto fares and the stress of getting on uncomfortably busy boats Donâ t be put off by people talking about getting lost in Venice â while thatâ s easy to do and a lovely experience the main routes around the sestieri are pretty easy to follow and thereâ s always another church bar or artisan shop to stop in Consider buying a timed pass for the vaporetto in Venice Â Matteo Colombo Getty Images Work out how much youâ ll use the vaporetto If youâ ve followed the advice above you might not need to use the vaporetto unless youâ re going out to the islands But if youâ ll be using it several times or more during your trip it could be worth buying a timed pass which gets cheaper the longer you stay A hour pass costs â hours costs â hours is â and a week is a relative bargain at â prices drop in if you book more than days in advance â see below Going to be staying longer or making regular visits Consider a Venezia Unica pass Available at the Piazzale Roma and Rialto ticket booths itâ s valid for five years and costs â upfront but then you only pay â per journey instead of â or â for a carnet of which doesnâ t expire Book on the ground transport in advance For Venice is trialing a system where visitors who book city transport more than days in advance get discounts of up to Book on the Venezia Unica website for dates before December and you can buy passes for advance travel Single vaporetto tickets go down from â to â and one two three and seven day passes to â â â and â respectively You can add an airport coach transfer but the saving is only â The deal also applies to museum entry â for instance a pass to the San Marco museums see below costs â instead of â You must book for a specific date at least days ahead however Itâ s not clear whether the discount scheme will be extended beyond Only visiting Basilica di San Marco You might not need a city pass Â Getty Images You might not need a city pass Donâ t assume the Venezia Unica Venice city pass is a great deal Unlike those in many other cities the Venezia Unica pass does not include free transport â and a card costs â That gets you into the Civic Museums and the Chorus churches below but if youâ re only really planning to see the Dogeâ s Palace itâ s better value to book a single ticket and buy the Chorus pass separately A reduced version of the Venezia Unica card costs â and only includes the San Marco museums â the Museo Correr and its conjoined archaeological museum and Marciana Library as well as the Palazzo Ducale Unless you want to see it all itâ s not the deal you might assume Go to church Yes many churches in Venice are free but many are worth paying for even when youâ re on a budget The Chorus collection of churches offers some of the cityâ s finest art and architecture Again ditch the false economies â instead of paying â per entry stump up for the pass to all the churches â it costs â and lasts a year Donâ t miss Santa Maria dei Miracoli a tiny jewel like church clad from inside to out in precious marble or San Sebastiano which was frescoed and painted all over by Veronese and is known as his â Sistine Chapelâ Eat standing up If you know Italy youâ ll already be aware of this rule wherever possible eat and drink standing up at the bar instead of sitting at a table Bar prices are fixed and are fairly cheap even in Venice Take a seat however and youâ ll be charged more â and probably subjected to mandatory table service for those extra euros Stay upright and even notoriously expensive places like Gran CaffÃ Quadri in Piazza San Marco become affordable Forget the Aperol spritz try its shadow instead to save some cents Â Zu Sanchez Photography Getty Images Drink a shadow of a spritz Sure everyone thinks they have to drink a spritz in Venice â not least actress Florence Pugh who made an instantly iconic entrance to the Venice Film Festival clutching a goblet of lurid orange Aperol But spritzes â usually prosecco some kind of bitter liqueur like Aperol or Campari and soda â can be pricey especially if youâ re speaking English at the bar and liable to be charged tourist prices yes you will be charged tourist prices Instead ask for an ombra â literally a â shadowâ of wine Itâ s essentially a small serving of house wine named after the booze stalls that used to set up in the shadow of Piazza San Marcoâ s bell tower and it can cost as little as â By the way if you insist on a spritz the Venetian aperitif of choice is Select not Aperol Swap the gondola for a traghetto Yes you want to ride a gondola Yes you want to see Venice from the water No steaming down the Grand Canal on a vaporetto isnâ t quite the same But before you shell out â for a half hour daytime gondola ride rising to â from November notice those low slung black boats being rowed across the Grand Canal and full of people Theyâ re traghetti â kind of like communal gondolas â which cross the canal at six points along its length The great thing about a traghetto ride Youâ re getting the same on the water experience as a gondola but it only costs â T The catch You share it with as many people as can be squeezed onboard And of course itâ s much shorter taking a couple of minutes to cross the canal But weâ ll take that over an awkward yet insanely pricey serenade Hit the beach The Italian coastline is notorious for private beach clubs that charge for access blocking off much of the natural heritage unless youâ re willing to pay OK Venice is no different but there is a nice stretch of public meaning free beach at the western end of Lido island Yes a beach in Venice â in fact the Lido is one long beach kilometer after kilometer of perfect sugary sand If you need a rest from the sightseeing donâ t sit at a bar and shell out for a spritz â just take the vaporetto across to the Lido and lie down Avoid the icons There are some things everyone says you must do in Venice Drink a Bellini cocktail at Harryâ s Bar Sit down at CaffÃ Florian for a drink in Piazza San Marco Have a lazy lunch at Locanda Cipriani on Torcello If youâ re on a budget do not do these things These places are iconic for a reason of course â but theyâ re also full of tourists and prices are sky high Instead follow the sound of the Venetian dialect to nearby places that are just as memorable but at a fraction of the cost In Piazza San Marco try Aurora which is not as posh but much cheaper or stand at the bar at Quadri run by the Michelin starred Alajmo brothers On Torcello swap Locanda Cipriani expensive and also snobby if our recent experience is anything to go by for the Taverna Tipica Veneziana an outdoor buffet where you order at the counter and eat in the garden And instead of going to Harryâ s slide over to Giudecca where right by Harryâ s Dolci sister restaurant to the original Harryâ s Bar are some other bars by the vaporetto stop at Palanca Sit outside â the views are the same but your bill will be in single figures Hey kid forget the fridge magnets in Venice Â Imgorthand Getty Images Take responsibility You already know that fragile Venice is being destroyed by overtourism Sometimes it feels like being on a budget means you canâ t help but be part of the problem â you think you canâ t afford to eat in a nice restaurant buy a sumptuous handmade mask or stay at a locally owned hotel But thatâ s not true OK the fancy restaurant and hotel may be beyond your budget this time but start small â with souvenirs Donâ t touch the crappy plastic magnets and masks you see on thousands of stalls around town go for something handmade and memorable Most Venice artisans make entry level stuff as well as top drawer items and a little hand stitched notebook marbled pencil or hand blown glass bead for â makes far better memories of your trip than a factory made snow globe If you see a workshop you like feel free to ask about their cheaper items â artisans are always thrilled to meet people who value their work and history And itâ s easier on the planet than shipping in that plastic stuff from abroad too Enjoy the freebies Donâ t forget that while restaurants and hotels in Venice may be expensive the main sights youâ re going for are free The Rialto Bridge and Piazza San Marco are of course free as is the glorious Salute church on the Grand Canal The Basilica di San Marco is now charging â for entry but thatâ s a paltry amount to see a gold filled church and you shouldnâ t skip it Book online in advance to save the long queue Donâ t break the rules One easy way to save money in Venice donâ t treat the city like your personal playground Most visitors are by now aware that there are strict rules in place no picnicking no sitting on bridges or in Piazza San Marco and certainly no swimming in the canals And yet many people decide the rules donâ t apply to them The problem is Venice is an extremely fragile city and if all visitors that day decided to sit on that bridge or lay out a picnic in that square itâ d be a major issue This is why people do get fined â even for what seem like minor infractions and sometimes after the fact thanks to a top notch CCTV system that means police can track down tourists after theyâ ve left Fines can run into thousands of euros â and if youâ ve got that kind of money to blow you should be using it to go all out at the Gritti Palace in the first place Daily costs in Venice Hostel room US dorm bed Basic room for two US Self catering apartment from US Public transport ticket US one way Coffee from US standing at the bar Sandwich from US Dinner for two US Glass of wine US Average daily cost US per person Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with
