scattering of downy clouds flower strewn valleys dotted with cool blue lakes a view of Austria as dreamed up by a team of Hollywood s special effects geniuses so many thought But no except for the bicycle ride along the Mondsee those scenes were filmed right here in Austria s fabled Salzkammergut region The Lake District of Upper Austria centered on the region called the Salzkammergut literally salt estates offers stunning sights soaring mountains and needlelike peaks a glittering necklace of turquoise lakes forested valleys populated by the Rehe roe deer immortalized by Felix Salten in Bambi this is Austria at its most lush and verdant Some of these lakes like the Hallst√§tter See remain quite unspoiled partly because the mountains act as a buffer from busier more accessible sections of the country Another historic reason relates to the presence of the salt mines which date back to the Celtic era with salt so common and cheap nowadays many forget it was once a luxury item mined under strict government monopoly and the Salzkammergut was closed to the casually curious for centuries opening up only after Emperor Franz Josef made Bad Ischl one of the area s leading spa towns even then studded with salt water swimming pools his official summer residence in A favorite passion for Austrians is das Wandern or hiking The Lake District has many miles of marked trails including the BergeSeen Trail which stretches km miles and connects of the region s lakes The trail can be explored in stages most of which end in one of the Salzkammergut s lovely towns Cycling popular among locals and visitors offers an athletic way to see miles of landscape at a doable pace Within this pastoral perfection you can stay in age old Schloss hotels or modern villas dine in fine restaurants and shop for the linens ceramics woodcarvings and painted glass of the region Sights Listings Hotels Listings Restaurants Listings Performing Arts Listing Guidebooks for Every Journey
