this summer Isabella Noble Jun min read Share Playa de las Teresitas Tenerife Â With Spain s international borders set to reopen on June to EU and Schengen area countries and on July to most others depending on individual public health situations the sun soaked Canary Islands are leading the way in welcoming back foreign travellers â with creative plans that put the focus on safe sustainable and enjoyable trips for visitors while also cooperating with tourism operators and the islandsâ local communities Advertisement The Canary Islands have had fairly few COVID cases and the pandemic here has been well managed At the time of writing there had been only cases and deaths since February despite an early outbreak at the Costa Adeje Palace Hotel in Tenerife among a population of over two million Remote El Hierro and Isla Graciosa have had no COVID cases at all these two islands along with neighbouring La Gomera and the Balearic island of Formentera were the first Spanish regions to move into phase one of the official desescalada de escalation of lockdown in early May Most of Spain including the Canaries is expected to enter the post lockdown nueva normalidad new normality on June and travel between the eight Canary Islands has been allowed since June Streets of San SebastiÃ n de la Gomera the capital of and municipality on La Gomera in the Canary Islands Spain Â Stian Klo Lonely Planet The Canary Islands tourism authorities are keen for visitors to be able to relax and enjoy their time on the islands while also helping the industry get back on its feet tourism makes up of the Canariesâ GDP In a media webinar on June Cristina del RÃ o Fresen leader of the Global Tourism Safety Lab at the Ministry of Tourism Canary Islands emphasised that â health and holidayâ for visitors of all nationalities must be compatible This means being â creative and innovative with the protocolsâ but also ensuring that newly introduced plans donâ t have damaging side effects â such as increased plastic waste through use of disposable face masks Travellers will be encouraged to buy reusable products and wherever possible support local vendors and suppliers How will I get there Most international flights to the Canary Islands from across Europe are expected to restart in late June or early July Wizz Air is already flying to Tenerife and Gran Canaria from London Luton from July frequency and routes are scheduled to expand and flights to from Fuerteventura should start Ryanair has announced that it will resume of its schedule from July including flights to from Tenerife Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria There will of course be important safety focused changes to flying which are likely to include mandatory face masks social distancing and temperature checks To help restore confidence in travel the Canary Islands are working with the United Nations World Tourism Organisation to trial the worldâ s first digital health passport on a â safe flightâ from Madrid in early July La Palma Canary Islands Spain Â Lovethief Photography Getty Images Will I have to quarantine and or take a COVID test All travellers â regardless of where theyâ re coming from â will be strongly encouraged to take a polymerase chain reaction PCR test for COVID in their country of departure to hours ahead of travel though this wonâ t be compulsory Those who do so will fast track through arrivals in the Canaries and receive vouchers to spend at local businesses There will also be temperature checks for all passengers on arrival and departure Advertisement If an arriving visitor tests positive for COVID theyâ ll be moved to independent accommodation to quarantine or to hospital for treatment there will be no cost for this the rest of their group will be tested and if necessary the whole group can isolate together Given the global possibility of a second COVID wave the islands have put in place a â traffic lightâ alert system that will enable an immediate reaction to stem the spread of the virus and local hospitals are cooperating to provide healthcare for anyone who needs it Face masks are now mandatory in all public spaces in Spain where social distancing is not possible this is expected to remain in place after the countryâ s state of alarm ends on June Anaga Mountains Taganana Tenerife Â Getty Images Will hotels restaurants and bars be open Hotels in the Canary Islands have officially been allowed to reopen since early May Though most hotels remain closed at the moment many are carefully preparing to welcome guests again and aiming for around capacity this summer As of phase three restaurants and bars can open with capacity on terraces and serve drinks and food inside with capacity and at the bar as long as social distancing of is maintained under the nueva normalidad these rules are expected to stay in place with additional safety measures that might include for example temperature checks In terms of accommodation safety the Canary Islands are considering each property in its own right and encouraging individualised solutions with social distancing the crucial factor One way systems could be added cleaning will be rigorous buffet breakfasts will look very different protective screens extended hours to reduce crowds waiter service and sunbeds will be spread out The islandsâ many self catering apartments and villas will no doubt prove particularly popular this year Hotels and restaurants will also be replacing all paper documentation with digital alternatives â most menus will involve scanning a QR code payment will be by card or better yet phone and check in perhaps by app rather than face to face San Sebastian de la Gomera Canary Islands Â Mikadun Shutterstock Is public transport up and running Binter Canarias the main inter island airline is currently operating flights a day while Canaryfly is planning to start operating again on July Ferries have been fitted with hand sanitiser dispensers social distanced seating and more efficient air filters and major companies such as Fred Olsen and Naviera Armas are up and running again Buses will be operating at capacity to ensure social distancing Will beaches sights and hiking trails be open Beaches have been allowed to open since the islands entered phase two in May and you can go surfing among the Atlantic waves The islandsâ natural beauty is a big part of their appeal and tourism teams are keen to steer clear of for example installing plastic screen dividers as considered elsewhere in Europe The key instead will be to maintain two metre social distancing on the Canariesâ most expansive strands of sand like Lanzaroteâ s Caleta de Famara or Fuenteventuraâ s Parque Natural de JandÃ a thereâ s plenty of space to spread out while smaller beaches will have controlled access and limited capacity Museums galleries and markets are already open at capacity and the archipelagoâ s many lovely walking trails are mostly ready to go â and independent open air activities such as hiking and cycling are on everyoneâ s minds for For the latest updates check the Canary Islands Tourism website You might also like Safe travels
