pilgrimage to just one abbey in Switzerland this really should be it The Abbey of St Gall complex sits in the centre of the city of St Gallen Didier Marti Getty Images History of Stiftsbibliothek St Gallen Local lore has it that St Gallen began with a bush a bear and an Irish monk who should have watched where he was going In AD as the tale goes itinerant monk St Gall Gallus one of the twelve companions of Saint Columbanus was on a mission from Ireland to the continent He fell into a briar bush and considered the stumble a calling from God After a fortuitous encounter with a bear in which he persuaded it to bring him a log take some bread in return and leave him in peace he used the log to begin building the simple hermitage that would one day evolve into St Gallen s cathedral Whether or not you believe the bit about the briar and the bear St Gall was instrumental in sewing the seeds of what would blossom into one of the world s greatest Benedictine abbeys founded by Abbot Otmar in AD The city of St Gallen sprang up around the abbey and developed into one of Europe s most important intellectual and religious centres In the Middle Ages monks flocked here from afar to pray read study scriptures and devote years to copying and illustrating manuscripts a painstaking solitary act that required a patient hand and a peaceful heart Arts letters and sciences flourished here and the library grew to impressive proportions with its manuscripts inspiring accomplished artists and leading literary scholars from Notker Balbulus to Ekkehart IV The abbey survived the threats and fires that ravaged the town over the centuries and the turbulent times of the Reformation Based on plans by star architect of the baroque age Peter Thumb of Vorarlberg the new abbey was built in the mid century just before the abbey lands were secularised and the abbey itself dissolved in The former abbey church became a cathedral in and the whole site including the Stiftsbibliothek was granted
