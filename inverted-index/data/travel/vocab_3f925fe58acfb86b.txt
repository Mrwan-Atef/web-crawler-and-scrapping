Gijisi South Korea and features a rope feet long Photograph by Sudong Kim By Ben Lerwill November This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK In the only a few years after the destruction of the Korean War South Korea began putting an official classification on its most cherished crafts customs and celebrations Known as National Intangible Cultural Heritage the designation has since been applied to almost practices from hemp weaving to masked dances Collectively they give visitors the chance to learn more about somewhere that still places huge value on its traditions even as the destination itself changes and evolves Admire elegant architecture Derived from mokjang an old Korean word for carpenter the term daemokjang describes a hugely skilled form of wooden architecture as well as the master artisan architects responsible for it As part of the centuries old technique lumber is first cut and shaved then slotted into place and interlocked without nails The results are so strong they re known as joints to last a millennium Related Surprising Things You Didn t Know About North Korea Examples of daemokjang can be found across Korean regions and social classes ranging from traditional hanok style houses to royal palaces in the capital and monumental mountain temples They tend to be undecorated their beauty like much of Korean architecture lying instead in their majestic size elegant simplicity and surprising longevity How to do it Changdeokgung Palace in Seoul and Bulguksa Temple on Tohamsan Mountain in North Gyeongsang Province are superb UNESCO listed examples of the daemokjang style Both are open for visits Learn about society with a Masked dance It looks at first like a kind of bawdy pantomime Costumed characters parade on stage donning grinning rosy cheeked wooden masks They sneer and mock flirt and dupe Traditional dances of this kind are common across South Korea and in places like UNESCO listed Hahoe pronounced Hah hway in the south east of the country they re about more than just a bit of fun Founded in the century the village sits in a snaking bend of the Nakdong River among open fields and wide hills It draws more than a million visitors a year thanks to this scenic location as well as its folk traditions including this ritual with roots dating back some years Traditional mask dances are popular in South Korea and comically pokes fun at the Korean class system Photograph by Jaewon Chung It combines popular entertainment with social commentary poking fun at the old Korean class system Of the original mask designs used in the performance three have been lost to time meaning there are now nine recurring characters They all represent a figure in local society from a gossipy grandmother and meddling merchant to a lecherous monk Dark comedy ensues If elsewhere the masks are traditionally burned after each performance to exorcise the demons thought to possess them in Hahoe they re handed down through the generations Some are now even designated as national treasures in their own right Legend has it they were originally made by a local craftsman who received divine instructions in a dream Commanded to construct them out of view of anyone else he shuttered himself away His work was cut short when his lover peeked into his workshop breaking the god given conditions and killing him there and then This is why it s said the mask of the village fool remains half finished Each dance is generally accompanied by a taepyeongso a reed instrument similar to a small oboe and a band of percussionists playing drums and gongs The result is a lively but fiercely satirical look at the underbelly of Korean society How to do it Regular performances are staged in Hahoe itself Alternatively witness it alongside other regional mask dances at the nearby Andong Maskdance Festival which takes place over days each autumn Be moved by a heartfelt musical tradition If you find K pop a bit too sugary this earnest artform provides something of an antidote Pansori is a type of musical storytelling typically narrated by a vocalist solo but for an accompanying buk barrel drum They perform on a empty stage with only a wooden fan by way of props And they can hold an audience for up to eight hours at a time Pansori first found an audience in the country s south west during the century Initially aimed at working people many of whom couldn t read stories on paper it eventually adopted a more literary approach and became favoured by the elite Today just like then the singers who must memorise reams of lyrics and deliver them at volume undergo extensive training And while they no longer add personal improvised touches like they used to in an effort to preserve the original narratives the emotion remains Gestures and expressions add to the drama while the drum builds tension The tales can be mournful or thrilling but you can expect a happy ending How to do it Performances take place at arts centres across the country and they don t all last eight hours three to four is more typical globalinterpark com Take part in an all out Buddhist festival A Buddhist festival Baekjung is a chance to remember and celebrate the deceased It s observed in different ways among devotees across the country and beyond but nowhere more impressively than in the southeastern city of Miryang In this former farming community the festival has agricultural undertones too and mixes carnival like festivities with shamanic practice White clad participants in the past servants who d been given the day off undertake a series of ritual prayers and offerings for a bountiful harvest accompanied by frantic drum music Celebrations then turn to merrymaking with a traditional type of farmer dance closing the day How to do it The festival is held on the day of the seventh lunar month September in and August in Geumbakjang gold leaf imprinting Painstaking is the word that comes to mind when witnessing geumbakjang the Korean art of gold leaf imprinting The country s nobility started advertising its status using gold as far back as the early years of the Joseon dynasty an era that began in And what better way of showing your prestige than adorning the very clothes you wear The practice involves imprinting everything from silken headpieces to ceremonial robes with repeated patterns of radiant gold and it requires serious skill and focus Multiple layers of wafer thin gold leaf are laid onto fabrics using specially cut woodblocks with not a single wrinkle permitted Lotus flower patterns are common as are lines of shimmering poetry The end results are suitably lustrous the very definition of dazzling wealth How to do it In Seoul s Bukchon Village the Kum Bak Yeon workshop keeps the skill alive The craft has been handed down through five generations of the same family and the workshop can still be visited today Yugijang Making even the choicest crockery look dull by comparison yugijang also known as bangjja is the ancient art of hand forged bronzeware The method involves heating a bronze alloy with a far higher proportion of tin than normal over fire then pounding it into shape to create a thin firm and gleaming product The bronze is said to retain heat far more effectively than other materials while repeated use makes it burnished rather than discoloured Dating perhaps unsurprisingly from as long ago as the Bronze Age it later became the favoured tableware technique of choice for Korean high society with a complete set including bowls dishes spoons and chopsticks Korean royal court cuisine which often comprises twelve opulent courses and also features as National Intangible Cultural Heritage is routinely served using bangjja bowls and dishes The respect afforded to the artform means some pieces are now even hung on walls as decorative objects How to do it The Daegu Bangjja Yugi Museum has a collection of almost bangjja brassware items with musical instruments and religious items on show alongside delicately crafted tableware There s also a reconstruction of a workshop from the end of the century Published in the
