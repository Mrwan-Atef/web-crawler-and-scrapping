How Gen Z and Millennials are making cruising cool again TRAVEL How Gen Z and Millennials are making cruising cool again From active itineraries to risqué entertainment the cruise industry is broadening its offering in a bid to appeal to younger generations Gen Z and Millennials made up almost half of cruise ship guests last year Photograph by We Fly Aerial Media By Ben Clatworthy January This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK It s and the DJ is pumping out noughties bangers Those on the dancefloor mostly in their early to early are in their element In the entrance to the club a mirrored tunnel made for Instagram shoots a group of girls are taking selfies in their best outfits Yet this was not a night out in London nor Paris or Berlin This was an evening on Virgin Voyages inaugural ship Scarlet Lady back in the Covid test era of Backed by Richard Branson s Virgin Group the new company was on a mission to prove that cruises were no longer the preserve of the blue rinse brigade It remains a mission cruise lines across the industry share to do away with any notion of set mealtimes and staid entertainment and in doing so entice new younger passengers After all if there s one thing cruise bosses agree on it s that the health of the industry relies on catering not only to veterans of the seas but also to people who might otherwise have never considered a cruise holiday The kids are alright Earlier this year Royal Caribbean revealed that almost half of its guests in recent years have been of millennial age or younger More broadly the annual report by the Cruise Lines International Association CLIA showed that globally millennials accounted for of all passengers that year with Generation Z accounting for Crucially CLIA found that of those millennials who have previously cruised plan to sail again Lydia Tempest Mitchell is among a cohort of young people who grew up cruising with their parents having already been on to sailings on about six different lines including Celebrity MSC Royal Caribbean Carnival and Virgin Voyages I ve been all over on cruises to South America lots around Europe to Spain and the Balearics she says One of the biggest draws cited by young cruisers such as Lydia is that like road trips cruises offer travellers the chance to explore multiple destinations only with entertainment dining experiences and time at sea thrown in Last year Lydia went with a group of first time cruiser friends on a trip around the Greek islands It was one of the best trips of my life she says They were all really nervous about what to expect but now one of them is trying to convince his friends to go on one In many ways Lydia is exactly the kind of young person the cruise lines want to attract someone familiar with the cruise experience since childhood and now introducing it to her friends If we go back to years our challenge as an industry was very much about getting people to try a cruise for the first time says Andy Harmer managing director of CLIA Because what we know is once they ve cruised for the first time then they re very likely to cruise again and tell their friends and family The good thing about the next generation of cruisers is that they re likely to be people who grew up taking cruises with their parents So we don t have that same barrier anymore because they already know and understand the cruise experience The industry is also buoyed by the increasing number of multi generational trips groups typically consisting of three generations with children parents and grandparents travelling together CLIA data shows about of cruisers in were part of a multi generational party Much of this growth is due to the diversification of ships onboard offerings but also the cruise itineraries themselves Hammer says These days it s not just about the destinations but also the curated experiences be it activities such as hiking cycling or kayaking or cultural tours and wine tastings What we know is younger people want to try something new Virgin Voyages offers a collection of restaurants food carts and pop ups and a cocktail class that provides instructions on how to take great pictures of the drinks you make Photograph by Virgin Voyages Bite size adventures Decades of market research has found a feeling of being trapped on board to be a major concern for first time cruisers This coupled with the widespread belief that social media has left millennials and Generation Z with shorter attention spans than their parents has led to a growing number of mini cruises many aimed squarely at younger customers Over the past couple of years we ve worked to bring the average length of our cruises down says Aaron Langford senior sales director at Royal Caribbean in the UK And what we ve found is the formula works for two reasons One it really entertains the new to cruise market which really skews towards the younger demographic and two it appears to be attracting a broader set of holidaymakers Royal Caribbean s mini cruise programme includes two and three night weekend sailings to see Bruges in Belgium It also offers five night trips to Hamburg and Rotterdam all departing from Southampton From Barcelona it has five night itineraries that take in the Spanish French and Italian Mediterranean P O Cruises also has a programme of shorter cruises departing from Southampton It includes a three night trip to Guernsey as well as four night journeys to Amsterdam alongside a France and Belgium sailing taking in Cherbourg and Bruges Adam Coulter who runs the information site Cruise Critic believes the short cruise trend emerged in North America where lines including Royal Caribbean have invested in private islands as a way to entice younger passengers At Perfect Day at CocoCay the operator s private island in the Bahamas you can plunge down North America s highest water slide splash around in the Caribbean s largest wave pool rise in a helium balloon or just kick back on the beach Before it was always a seven night round trip says Coulter Now you can do four or three days or even just go to their private island It attracts young people because you can try it and see if you like it If you decide it s not for you then that s fine You re not locked in for seven or days Getting a taste for it Generation Instagram are also being wooed with an ever growing array of dining options Coulter says with the notion of set dinner times in large dining halls firmly a thing of the past For Virgin Voyages cuisine was central to its offering given millennials reputation for being a generation of gastronomes As well as a collection of restaurants food carts and pop ups the line s three ships offer a cocktail class that provides instruction on how to take great pictures of the drinks you make We re known for the best food in the cruise industry says Nirmal Saverimuttu Virgin Voyages chief executive People come on board experience it and compare it to going out to dinner in London or New York To entice younger passengers cruise ships offer special drink packages and shorter weekend voyages Photograph by Scott Grummett Archie Thomas Its pièce de résistance is The Test Kitchen a fine dining restaurant cum culinary laboratory where the staff wear white coats It s won plaudits for its ever evolving six course tasting menu with each dish centred on a key ingredient Other brands have also stepped up their food credentials Launched in P O Cruises ship Arvia the largest ever to be built specifically for the British market has separate places where passengers can go to eat and drink P O Cruises has also signed partnerships with singers like Nicole Scherzinger as well as celebrity chefs Marco Pierre White and Shivi Ramoutar which line president Paul Ludlow believes helps bring down the average age and increase appeal Having these people signed up to the brand really helps break down barriers around the perception of cruises Everyone knows who Marco is he s three Michelin starred And if they see that we work with him it gives them an idea of what to expect Then they see Gary Barlow is the musical director and think oh I d probably like the entertainment too Eco conscious travellers may be less easily convinced however UK government statistics show young people have a greater environmental awareness than their parents of people aged to have made some or a lot of changes to their lifestyle to help tackle environmental issues according to the Office for National Statistics and while the industry is working hard to improve its image cruising and sustainability are still far from easy bedfellows Many lines are moving to greener technology including ships with liquefied natural gas far cleaner than conventional fuel Ports around the world are also adding new shore to ship power infrastructure allowing vessels to plug into the grid and switch off their engines when not at sea Brands are also learning from their mistakes in targeting the new to cruise demographic For adults only Virgin Voyages there were two big changes The first says Saverimuttu was to make the cabins less minimalist and add some warmth Ditched too were the boxes of sex toys placed in every cabin Second was to tone down some of the entertainment He says We had an adult entertainment show that turned out to be a bit too risqué We had a lot of feedback that it was a bit too polarising I d be the first to say that we ve made mistakes along the way We should be OK with saying hey we got that wrong More
