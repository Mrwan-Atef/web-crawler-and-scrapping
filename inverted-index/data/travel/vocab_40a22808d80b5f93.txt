forums more specific subject areas which contain threads conversations on a topic which are made up of individual posts where a user writes something For example the Fodor s Destination category includes an Asia forum which includes a thread called First trip to Japan and that thread includes many posts The board home page has a list of categories and forums with basic statistics for each including the number of threads and posts and which member posted the most recent message The Fodor s bulletin board s categories are Destinations Travel Topics and Support How do I find my way around When you click on a forum s name you are taken to the list of threads it contains A thread is a conversation between members or guests Each thread starts out as a single post and grows as more individual posts are added by different users To start a new thread simply click on the new thread button you will need to be registered to do this Threads can be ordered in many different ways The default is to have the thread with the most recent activity at the top But you can easily change this ordering for example to have the thread with the most posts at the top simply click on the appropriate column heading at the top of the list of threads Thread Thread Starter Last Post Replies or Views You can also reverse the sorting order by clicking the arrow next to the name of the active option Note that sticky threads will always be at the top no matter how you change the viewing options Multi page views When there are more threads to display than will fit on a single page you may see the Page box which contains page numbers This indicates that the list of threads has been split over two or more pages What are sticky threads Sticky threads are created by moderators or administrators and remain stuck to the top of the listing even if they haven t had any posts recently Their purpose is to keep important information visible and accessible at all times How do I reply to a thread To post a reply to an existing thread click on the Post Reply button If the Post Reply button does not appear it could mean that you are not logged in as a member or that you do not have permission to reply or that the thread has been closed to new replies There will also be a Quick Reply box where you can quickly enter a reply without having to go to the Post Reply page Is there a faster way to get to forums If you know which forum you want to go to you can use the Forum Jump control which appears at the bottom of many pages within the board How do I find out more about members

messages as the administrator has probably set a limit to the number of private messages you can have in your folders If you exceed this number you will not be able to send or receive new messages

read receipt request you may have the option to read the message while denying the read receipt request To do this simply click the Deny Receipt link rather than the title of the message if it appears
