of Dubrovnik with a view of the harbor xbrchx Shutterstock Dubrovnik has withstood earthquakes and sieges Its marble flagstones and rugged walls give this lovely city â Croatiaâ s most popular â a timeless feel Advertisement But the seasons have a major impact on a trip to this Balkan gem Choosing the best time to visit depends on your attitude to the weather and big crowds High summer ushers in festivals and sunshine soaked streets and beaches while winter can seem like you have the city to yourself and is a gift to those traveling on a budget This is how to choose best time to visit Dubrovnik for you Whatâ s the weather like in Dubrovnik Dubrovnik is in southern Dalmatia near Croatia â s southern tip The Adriatic offers swimming and water sports and gives this port city a maritime climate Summers are warm and sunny and winters are damp and fairly mild Itâ s a compact place with under residents â making it significantly smaller than Split and Zadar further up the coast That means the picturesque Old Town can get crowded during peak times so plan your trip carefully A crowded Dubrovnik beach during summer with the fortress in the background Roman Babakin Shutterstock July and August bring high temps great festivals and crowds In July and August the high season the sea is warm and thereâ s an average of hours of sunshine each day Temperatures frequently exceed F C as a constant stream of festivals â which focus on classical music theater folk and opera â arrive in town Croatiaâ s many dance music festivals are further up the coast near Zadar but buses and ferries make getting around a breeze This all means Dubrovnik gets busy so book your accommodations as early as possible Overnight visitors are joined by cruise ship passengers several times a day which can make the Old Town hectic Things are quietest before or after and day trips and visits to nearby islands mean you wonâ t struggle to fill your day Advertisement By August the water is at its warmest though you may need to look for longer to find a quiet spot â try hopping on a sea kayak or getting a boat to the car free Elaphite Islands Dubrovnikâ s cultural blitz continues with concerts and theater usually including century playwright Marin â s exuberant comedies The heat and high visitor numbers mean itâ s not worth rushing â instead go with the flow and soak up the atmosphere Stradun is the main shopping street in Dubrovnik and is less busy during shoulder seasons Matt Ragen Shutterstock May June September and October offer sunshine and breathing space In May June September and October temperatures of F C or higher are common and while the sea can be cool this is still a good time for a beach focused holiday The Old Town can sometimes get crowded but without the intensity of July and August Conditions are good for touring the islands hiking or rafting May is a great time to visit as almost everything is open without being too busy You can enjoy the spring sunshine from pavement cafes and itâ s a good month for walking try the Way of the Cross hilly Å ipan or wooded Mljet June offers warm sun and an early summer buzz plus youâ ll find less congestion on the cityâ s famous walls giving you more time to appreciate Dubrovnikâ s proud trading history and glittering sea views By September Dubrovnik slips gently into the shoulder season At the start of the month classical festivals are still in full swing the weather can be baking and the Old Town is full of eager visitors But as September moves on things become cooler and less feverish Itâ s a fine time to visit with plenty of sunshine but space to breathe at popular attractions October is another of Dubrovnikâ s most pleasant months and your last chance for beach time Some restaurants and hotels shut but thereâ s enough going on for the city to still feel vibrant including food festivals and sporting events Hiking and kayaking are appealing accommodations are relatively affordable and the cool waters off beaches such as Sveti Jakov and Bellevue are yours to explore Locals and tourists browsing the stalls at Gruz Street Market in Dubrovnik s Old Town suttirat wiriyanon Shutterstock November to April is great for visitors on a budget If you re visiting between November and April it ll be too cold to stretch out on the beach But if youâ re looking to explore the cityâ s architectural and cultural delights in peace youâ re in luck The Old Town feels less like a busy museum and more like a living city quite a few bars and restaurants stay open right through the winter and hotel prices drop substantially November can be lovely with average temperatures reaching a high of around F C Youâ ll rarely wait in line anywhere so you can pack in museums galleries churches and nearby destinations such as Split before heading inside to fill up on a hearty meal of stuffed peppers and spicy bean soup December is usually cold and often wet but celebrations bring a spark to its dark evenings The Winter Festival has twinkling lights a Christmas Fair and plenty of cod dishes Most visitors stay away for January the cityâ s coldest month But come February the festivals begin again The Feast of St Blaise celebrates Dubrovnikâ s patron saint with concerts and theater while the Carnival packs in a costume parade wine street food and kidsâ activities Visitor numbers are still low in March but itâ s good for exploring the city walls or day trips to fishing villages or Trsteno Arboretum Accommodations are still inexpensive April sees a distinct uptick in sunshine and a shift in the cityâ s energy too Easter is the traditional start of the tourist season and the festival features street events and pinca sirnica a sweet Easter bread Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
