min read Share The oft photographed Lion Rock dominates the bay and beach at Piha Â Justin Foulkes Lonely Planet Aucklandâ s best beaches are a diverse bunch ranging from the surf trimmed expanses of the regionâ s west coast to the cafe culture and family friendly city beaches lining the serpentine bays of TÄ maki Drive Advertisement Venture further afield both north and south for excellent swimming beaches or team sandy sojourns with fine food beer and wine on Waiheke Island Fly or catch a vehicle ferry to forested Great Barrier Island for a unique combination of surfing and stargazing Mission Bay is best for urban diversion The standout stretch of sand along Aucklandâ s TÄ maki Drive Mission Bay is a popular destination for many Auckland families Join in with an impromptu game of touch rugby or volleyball stretch out on the grass with a feast of fish and chips or watch on as Mission Bay s art deco fountain is gradually illuminated as twilight falls After dark bars and restaurants like the Good George Tap Room and Azabu are perennially busy spots Takapuna is the spot for paddle boarding and ice cream Across the Auckland Harbour Bridge on the cityâ s North Shore the sweeping arc of Takapuna provides brilliant views of Rangitoto the year old volcanic island punctuating the eastern horizon of the Hauraki Gulf Takapuna is popular for swimming and paddleboarding and on some mornings it may seem that walking a dog is mandatory With or without a canine companion an ice cream from the Takapuna Beach Cafe is an essential purchase The red blossoms of the pÅ hutukawa tree bloom on Takapuna Beach in Auckland Â ChameleonsEye Shutterstock Piha is the most popular west coast surf beach Crowned by the leviathan bulk of Lion Rock actually the eroded core of an extinct volcano Piha is the most popular surf beach on Auckland s rugged west coast At low tide walking trails along Piha s black sand lead to rocky formations dubbed the Camel and the Gap while the best views of waves rolling in across the Tasman Sea are from high above on the clifftop Mercer Bay Loop Track Stop in at Murray a relaxed combination of surf shack and cafe for coffee and tacos Advertisement Muriwai is best for surfing paragliding and blokarting Surf and surging Tasman breezes are the attraction at Muriwai with board riders also negotiating waves at adjacent Maukatia Bay and paragliders drifting on Tasman Sea thermals high above Muriwaiâ s black sand When the winds are right blokart enthusiasts steer their land yachts along the beachâ s sandy racetrack and tÄ kapu Australasian gannets launch themselves from rocky islands at the southern end of the beach Whether you re surfing bodyboarding or paragliding Auckland has the perfect beach for it Â Manchan Getty Images Te Henga Bethells Beach is the best beach for a mini adventure Also known by its MÄ ori name Te Henga Bethells is one of the more remote of Aucklandâ s west coast beaches Getting to the windswept stretch of black sand crowned by rocky headlands to the north and south often involves the shoes off mini adventure of walking through the shallow waters of the Waitakere River Visit on a summer weekend for burgers pizza and coffee from the Bethells Cafe s humble food truck location Onetangi is best for bodyboarding â and sunset beers Welcome to bodyboarding heaven on Waiheke Aucklandâ s Hauraki Gulf island of wine Onetangi is also the longest beach on the island ensuring visitors have plenty of space to steer a brightly colored piece of foam plastic through gentle Hauraki Gulf waves After in the water action adjourn across the road to Ki MÄ ha where craft beers from Waihekeâ s Alibi Brewing partner with oysters from the islandâ s Te Matuku Marine Reserve Head to Onetangi for bodyboarding and wildlife watching Â Maria Frenzel Getty Images Man Oâ War Bay is the place to jump off a pier Itâ s a bumpy drive on unsealed roads to get to Waihekeâ s Man Oâ War Bay â an alternative is to arrive by floatplane from downtown Auckland â but itâ s definitely worth the journey Play beach cricket on the compact shoreline see who can make the biggest splash when jumping off the historic wharf or enjoy more grown up pleasures by trying the Valhalla chardonnay from Man Oâ War Vineyards Medlands Beach is best for wildlife and stargazing Dolphins and the occasional pod of orca are often seen off Medlands and the best beach on Aucklandâ s most far flung Hauraki Gulf island is also popular for surfing and bodyboarding Great Barrier Island â known to MÄ ori as Aotea â white cloudâ â was designated an International Dark Sky Sanctuary in and Good Heavens â Dark Sky Ambassadors set up their powerful telescopes amid Medlandsâ sand dunes after dark Look forward to views of the southern hemisphere night sky including seasonal sightings of Jupiter and Saturn During summer Island Gin â s simple Medlands tasting room serves up island crafted gin harnessing local forest botanicals Matheson Bay is Auckland s best swimming beach Enlivened during summer by the crimson blooms of pÅ hutukawa trees â dubbed New Zealandâ s Christmas tree â Matheson Bayâ s compact cove is one of the Auckland regionâ s best swimming beaches Even around low tide the beach slopes off quickly enough for swimming to be possible Matheson Bay is around one hour north of Auckland and itâ s worth combining with a visit to the Saturday morning farmersâ market at nearby Matakana TÄ papakanga is best for coastal walking trails Another Auckland beach definitely worth a one day Kiwi road trip this time to an Auckland regional park one hour southeast of the city Visit TÄ papakanga in late February for the Splore festivalâ s eclectic celebration of music dance and culture or have the beachâ s walking trails and tree shaded coves all to yourself on a weekday visit year round Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real New Zealand Let a local expert
