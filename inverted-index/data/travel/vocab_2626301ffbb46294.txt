Liquid sunshine everything you should know about Caribbean rum Caribbean rum is as multifaceted and full of personality as the region itself From Jamaica to Trinidad every island has their own twist on the archetypal West Indies spirit Photograph by Getty Images TRAVEL Liquid sunshine everything you should know about Caribbean rum From traditional century distilleries to beachside rumshacks the story of rum in the Caribbean is woven into the DNA of the region By Claire Dodd July min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Sipped against the soundtrack of the breeze gently riffling through palm fronds the tinny ring of reggae through blown out speakers and the slap of domino tiles on tables rum somehow just tastes better in the Caribbean After all this is where the spirit was born on islands that differ wildly in heritage culture and consequently styles of rum The Caribbean s tropical climate may be perfect for the cultivation of sugarcane but the creation of this decadent spirit in the century wouldn t have been possible without the unique combination of cultures involved in the industry Today rum is as omnipresent as ever with the region home to historic distilleries using the same techniques they ve used for hundreds of years alongside newer high tech producers The spirit is still a major part of the Caribbean s most important expressions of identity from carnivals and festivals to more personal moments such as births and funerals It s sewn into the DNA of Caribbean life And for visitors there s much to explore Island spirit In Jamaica rum is there for life s big moments from a little splash to wet the baby s head at a christening to marking the ninth night after a death with toasts and stories In Trinidad meanwhile on any given night you ll find crowds lining Ariapita Avenue s many bars rum in hand During carnival time on the island it s the Jab Molassie you need to keep an eye out for These demons are an important part of the culture with locals donning devil horns and gigantic wings in honour of them The tradition dates back to when freed slaves marked the carnival celebrations by covering themselves in the molasses from rum production In Haiti meanwhile a splash is still poured out to appease the spirits and as a gesture of respect ahead of a Vodou ceremony What made rum different from Asian sugarcane spirits or cachaça in Brazil which people were drinking years before was the culmination of different people says Ian Burrell creator of the world s first international rum festival UK RumFest Rum shacks such as this one on Mambo Beach in Curaçao offer the chance to enjoy traditional rums Photograph by Jane Sweeney AWL Images Once sugar production was established across the Caribbean there was a need to make money from its by product molasses Rum is first mentioned in records from Barbados in around although it it was likely to have been produced beforehand across the islands Its evocative early names indicate the strength of the spirit back then They include kill devil and rumbullion the latter of which means a great tumult or ruckus a sentiment anyone who s ever sipped rum straight off the still can relate to Enslaved Africans brought to Barbados were used to making drinks from fermented produce says Burrell They were even using fermented molasses already And then you had Europeans with distillation knowledge who were able to distil that fermented sugarcane and fermented molasses and turn it into the spirit of rum It was that know how and spirit of sharing that came from everyone living in the Caribbean environment drinking kill devil together which became part of local drinking culture That was then transported all around the world as it became an important currency for Europeans he adds Three essential distillery tours Mount Gay Rum Barbados It makes sense to start at the very beginning which for rum is Mount Gay Visitors are guided through every stage of the rum making process and the original buildings Opt for a cocktail masterclass a tasting of premium rums or a chocolate pairing River Antoine Rum Distillery Grenada Little has changed over the centuries

rums from overproof whites to cream liqueurs You can also visit the cane fields during harvest April to November or sign up for The St Lucia Rum Experience a great tour of the estate launched last year Mount Gay Rum Distillery Barbados has distilled rum for over years Photograph by Guy Harrop Alamy Cocktail of influences The push and pull of commerce the demands of local tastes and distinct colonial legacies meant rum styles evolved quite differently from island to island If you want to know more about the type of rum from an island all you need to do is get under the skin of its music its food and its general culture and you can always draw a straight line to the kind of rum that s drunk there says rum expert and Plantation Rum brand ambassador Paul McFadyen For thirsty travellers that means there are several important ports of call starting with Barbados Hailed as the birthplace of rum the still operational Mount Gay Rum Distillery built in is believed to be the oldest commercial rum distillery in the world Available as both pot and column distilled varieties Barbadian rums tend to be notably well balanced not too heavy not too light The situation is very different on Jamaica another former British colony Sonically Jamaica is reggae reggaeton and dancehall says McFadyen There s a lot of national pride imbued in the music which is loud and tonally rich Similarly the food is Scotch bonnet laced and bold Surprise surprise their rums are rich full and very loud on the palette and well suited for bold rum punches The most gnarly Jamaican rums pack an olfactory punch colloquially referred to as the funk think overripe bananas Producers there have historically used long fermentation periods to allow these bold flavours to develop which are dialled up even higher when distilled Jamaican rums are typically punchy but Appleton Estate the island s longest standing distillery have created a more laid back drink Photograph by Ron Giling Alamy Then there s Appleton Estate the oldest producer on the island Made in the lush Nassau Valley from sugarcane grown on its acres its taste is purposefully a little softer Venture to the visitor centre and you ll find out how the distillery s location amid a landscape of forests rivers and conical limestone peaks influences the final product While some Jamaican rums are fermented for up to three weeks Appleton favours a period of just hours Rum is an extremely important part of Jamaican culture says Appleton Estate master blender Joy Spence A bottle is found in every home in Jamaica and has many uses from cocktails to cuisine to cultural traditions It s not Jamaica without rum Like many products that come from agriculture and are developed over time the style is often evolved rather then settled on Our rums are distilled in a custom designed copper pot still that imparts a distinct orange peel top note Daily rain showers flow through the karsts and into the water stored within so there s no need for artificial irrigation for growing sugarcane Additionally the water we use for distillation comes from a beautiful spring on our estate which is the origin of the Black River It has a sweet soft taste that has an impact on the flavour and aroma profile of our rums she adds Venture to neighbouring Cuba or other former Spanish colonies such as the Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico meanwhile and the style leans sweet Made using column stills the rums are more delicate too perfect for a daiquiri or mojito on humid nights And across the French speaking islands of Guadeloupe Martinique and Haiti a different style of rum emerged Rhum agricole eschews the use of molasses instead using fermented sugarcane juice resulting in grassy herbal notes It s best tasted in a traditional ti punch Made with just rhum agricole lime and sugarcane juice it s one of the best ways to keep those delicate delectable notes intact Top five rum bars in the Caribbean Irie Bar St Lucia It s good vibes only at this easy breezy rum shack with a sterling selection of bottles where owner Andy also serves up the catch of the day often including lobster conch or octopus Visit on a Friday when the Gros Islet Fish Fry

s clear what to order Rick s Cafe Jamaica Show up at sunset and watch cliff divers test their nerve just outside this bar and restaurant The Negril Cliffs have attracted thrill seekers since the and there are few better ways to watch them than from the safety of your seat with a mojito in hand Looking forward Like anything else rum has been shaped by the passage of time The decline of the sugar industry and the transformation into a global business dominated by a handful of multinational corporations has led to a steep decline in the number of independent producers particularly in smaller destinations For example at the peak of production in Guyana there were distillers Today there s just one Still there s hope courtesy of a new wave of emerging producers pushing creative boundaries and making high quality rums One of the most prominent is Foursquare in Barbados The owners the Seale family have been involved in rum production since and launched this brand in the Their distillery produces a variety of rums including some aged in either bourbon or sherry casks to impart unique flavour profiles Elsewhere in Grenada the Renegade Rum Distillery is making waves It began production in and is on a mission to explore the potential of different sugarcane terroirs Renegade has spent the past seven years reintroducing the crop across the island for its single cane rums which will reflect each grow site ranging from those with hilly terrain and volcanic soil to others that are sandy and often low lying What makes rum a distinctive product is its collaborative nature with everyone free to create their own version Photograph by Alamy There are also new tours launching The beachside West Indies Rum Distillery in Barbados which makes Plantation Cockspur and Malibu among others is set to open to the public for the first time in its long history later this year We want to open ourselves up so people can come and see everything that we ve done over the last past years

master distillers We want to share that and bring some of it back to life For one of the most traditional experiences of Caribbean rum though you need to head to one of the many rum shacks for which
