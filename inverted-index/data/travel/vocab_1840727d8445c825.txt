read Share Piazza San Cosimato Market in Rome s Trastevere neighborhood Getty Images What makes a city Beyond the monuments and symbols that come to define points on a map cities draw us in because of the life that courses through them Almost no city does this better than Rome So whether youâ re a first time traveler or a seasoned veteran you cannot help but be seduced by the cityâ s enchanting bewildering infuriating contours Rome is a city that seems to defy even time itself â thereâ s a reason they call it the Eternal City The alchemy that breathes life into Rome isnâ t only found in its iconic statues and shrines Yes youâ ll want to stand awestruck in front of the Colosseum or brave the crowds to stand beneath the cupola of the Pantheon Youâ ll be tempted to wade through the Trevi Fountain â donâ t â and join the legions that pass through alleys to emerge victorious at the Spanish Steps But if you really want to find the real Rome branch out of the historic center and spend a bit more time in the different neighborhoods We could debate Romeâ s prettiest streets parks and piazzas until Roman concrete crumbled but one of the best things to do in the Italian capital is to find the parts of it that you donâ t often see on the cover of magazines Advertisement Here are the six best neighborhoods in Rome to immerse yourself in Head beyond the center of Rome for a taste of local life TFILM Getty Images Garbatella Storica Best neighborhood for authentic Roman life To discover another side of Rome away from the tourist queues head to Garbatella Storica one of the most distinct corners of the city Developed a century ago as a neighborhood for working class families Garbatella was based on the English garden city movement â a type of century urban planning that married housing and ample green space â and as such is filled with unique one and two story buildings many with their own gardens or shared allotments that are still used to grow vegetables and hang laundry Youâ ll see families tending their tomato plants or kids playing in the street in distinct buildings known as lotti public housing that has made the neighborhood famous While itâ s still predominantly a family neighborhood Garbatella is definitely on the radar there are bars restaurants and venues that truly capture the renegade spirit while bringing their own twist Have a drink at the iconic Bar Cesaroni after a performance at the equally legendary Palladium Theater Donâ t miss the community run Casetta Rossa a unique space that collects funds for needy families and provides resources to immigrants Garbatella Storica shows visitors a side of Rome unlike any other It s a minute metro ride on the B line from the center of the city or you can choose to walk there in about an hour Where to stay Hotel Abitart features changing contemporary art exhibitions by a local Roman artist to decorate its stylish mid sized hotel While not directly in Garbatella it is in adjacent and gentrifying Ostiense A portrait by Italian street artist David Diava Vecchiato marcovarro Shutterstock Ostiense San Lorenzo Coolest neighborhood in Rome Thereâ s a lot of debate about the coolest neighborhood in Rome â and with good reason From dips in the Trevi Fountain in Federico Felliniâ s great film La Dolce Vita to wild haired Vespa rides the Eternal City may just be the birthplace of cool But letâ s face it youâ re unlikely to run into many hip Romans if you spend most of your time waiting in line with a bunch of tourists Instead head south of the Aventino to Ostiense famous for its unmistakable Pyramid It borders the magnificently quirky non Catholic cemetery of Rome And if you visit Wednesday to Sunday you can rummage through the treasures at the CittÃ Ecosolidale a sprawling vintage market managed by the lay community of Santâ Egidio Ostiense is great for gourmands as well Seek out the elevated yet chic Trattoria Pennestri and plant based refuge Romeow Cat Bistrot Just behind the Roman walls to the east of Termini station is San Lorenzo Formerly a gritty working neighborhood â and then a slightly grimy student spot â the area has since become a destination in its own right Now one of the best places to check out street art in Rome youâ ll find work by local heroes like Alice Pasquini whose vivid depiction of women runs the length of via dei Sabelli to the mural Elisa Caracciolo created for International Womens Day in as a tribute to those who lost their lives to domestic violence Itâ s proof that art is alive and well in Rome beyond its famous museums Where to stay See above for a hotel right in Ostience Advertisement A buffet at a bistro in Testaccio Alexandra Bruzzese Lonely Planet Testaccio Best neighborhood for foodies There are precious few places left in the world that feel like Testaccio Framed by a great terracotta mountain and hulking bones of a slaughterhouse turned market Testaccio sits resolutely along the Tiber just south of the center of Rome If youâ re looking for the kind of place where families sit outside until the wee hours and the sounds of a football match echo through the streets this is it If you have ever known what it means to be a city kid youâ ll feel like youâ ve finally found your way home again Great food is just about everywhere in Rome but if your mind is led by your belly plan to spend a lot of time in Testaccio This is the gastronomic heart of the city where the quinto quarto cuisine fifth quarter the offal of butchered animals Try a classic cacio e pepe cheese and pepper spaghetti at Felice or Flavio al Velavevodetto both of which have been around since time immemorial For something more contemporary but not by much head to Piatto Romano where the classics get a thoughtful twist and the best things on the menu are actually off the menu always ask for the specials Osteria Fratelli Mori promises a raucous dining room and equally bold plates that put modern touches on standards like oxtail and tongue Taste all this and more at Mercato Testaccio where you can tell everyone to find you once you pull up a bench and realize that this is the only part of town youâ ll ever need to be Where to stay Just a stone s throw from Testaccio market the simple sun filled modern Sonder is a three star hotel that offers bright uncluttered rooms with window doors that open onto private balconies Beat the day trippers to St Peter s Basilica by basing yourself in Prati Maica Getty Images Prati Best neighborhood to stay in Tucked just behind the cupola of St Peterâ s Basilica in the Vatican City the Prati neighborhood is one of Romeâ s best and worst kept secrets Bordering the west bank of the Tiber River Prati is a mix of art nouveau cool and residential quiet that makes it an ideal location for a Roman holiday done the right way If youâ re looking to rub elbows with Romans who nail that mix of effortless cool and impeccable style youâ re in the right place â and if youâ re trying to snag a prime spot at the Vatican museums it helps to be right next door Prati also has some of the best shopping in Rome If youâ ve got a suitcase to spare make your way to via Cola di Rienzo and via Ottaviano two of the best streets for shopping in the city Choose from an array of well known Italian brands like Twinset or tiny shops like Il Bavero where clothes are still cut to measure The neighborhood is buzzing with great cafes like Habemus which is also conveniently located next to the Mercato Trionfale Romeâ s biggest and most varied food hall Sleep in the budget confines of Mama Shelter and drink at the rooftop bar to save some money Youâ ll be front and center for celebrity chef Stefano Callegariâ s RomanÃ the first restaurant from the man who redefined Roman street food Prati is very well connected to the rest of the city via metro B at both the Ottaviano and Cipro stations which will bring you to Termini station in just under minutes The Lungotevere a walking and cycling lane that runs along the Tiber is also found here and offers a spectacular perspective of the city from below Where to stay Simple and with a youthful vibe Il Plancton is right in the middle of the quiet Prati neighborhood Trastevere can be great for the little ones as well as the adults Imgorthand Getty Images Trastevere Best neighborhood for families If youâ ve ever had dreams of cobblestone streets and quirky daily scenes chances are youâ ve had Trastevere in your sights South of Vatican City and separated from the center only by the Tiber River indeed the name derives from trans Tiberim or beyond the Tiber Trastevere remains one of the most picturesque and enchanting areas of a city with no shortage of them In recent years it has become the headquarters for study abroad students living out their own adventures and it remains a must see for many day trippers However if youâ re on a family holiday Trastevere may be just the thing Eminently walkable with large swaths of pedestrianized streets Trastevere is most well known for its labyrinth cobblestone streets and major sites like the Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere one of the oldest churches in Rome Even the crankiest child canâ t help but stare in awe at the dazzling frescoes both inside and outside the building As much of the neighborhood is pedestrianized children can safely run around the fountain in the piazza that shares its name with the Basilica Cars do snake through crowds in some parts however so when you need to escape the engines head over to The Botanical Garden of Rome which features over plant species and plenty of kid friendly activities If that hasnâ t tired everyone out continue up to the Belvedere di Gianicolo a panoramic terrace atop one of the seven hills of Rome that offers incredible views of the entire city The abundance of expats in Trastevere means lots of the neighborhood restaurants have mastered the art of feeding capricious palates so youâ ll find familiar foods with fun local twists at Street Food and Meccanismo in Piazza Trilussa Donâ t miss Fatamorgana for some of the best and healthiest if such a thing can be said gelato youâ ll ever find Traveling without little ones You ll want to join the nightly crowd at Bar San Calisto in the eponymous piazza where you probably wonâ t get a table but youâ ll definitely get a good story and a great granita If you fancy some creatively prepared dishes and bottles of natural wine head over to Lâ Antidoto for a selection of both Where to stay Relais Le Clarisse has a gorgeous green filled internal courtyard surrounded by unique rooms providing an almost countryside feel to this chaotic and fun neighborhood Pigneto is the place to stay for aperitivo bars REDA CO Contributor Getty Images Pigneto Centocelle Best neighborhoods for aperitivo bars We could probably spend months touring the best aperitivo bars in the city but the best part of pre dinner drinks is the spontaneity one drink turns into three and the table grows as friends of friends stop by to join in In many ways itâ s the essence of what makes a neighborhood â and none do aperitivo quite like Pigneto Think of it as the fount from which hipster San Lorenzo bloomed Tucked in the tangle of railway lines that crisscross through the heart of the city Pigneto has been a bulwark of activism and inclusivity for generations During WWII it was a locus for the antifascist movement and later on a refuge for immigrants and artists alike Today working families live side by side with creative misfits creating a neighborhood so distinct that the famed filmmaker and noted kook Pier Paolo Pasolini couldnâ t help but fall in love with it Pigneto returned the favor with a series of murals dedicated to Pasolini on via Fanfulla da Lodi which have become their own destination The street art is a perfect backdrop to the irrepressibly buoyant scenes along the Isola Pedonale a pedestrian area that runs down via del Pigneto offers great food drinks the cocktails at Cargo never disappoint and people watching Those really in the know go deeper still into the Centocelle quarter which feels both like a step back in time and one into a fine future Get to Legs for Italian fried chicken you never thought possible or to Fassangue for tartare sushi and other raw meat delights Or simply sit for a while at Bar Orazio Where to stay Despite its deceptive name Blue Hostel is not a hostel but rather a lovely guest house with smart rooms beamed ceilings wooden floors and large windows in the adjacent San Lorenzo neighborhood Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Italy Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers
