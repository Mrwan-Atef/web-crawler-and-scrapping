best free things to do in Dubrovnik James Smart Vesna Celebic Mar min read Share Some of the best experiences in Dubrovnik can be done for no cost at all Â jin chu ferrer Getty Images Croatia has some stunning towns and cities but none can match Dubrovnik for tourist appeal The only problem Given the increased demand for this Dalmatian portâ s small and lovely old town budget travelers can feel squeezed out Never fear while Dubrovnik can be expensive some of the finest things to do in the city are completely free Indeed much of Dubrovnikâ s appeal comes down to the experience of just being there Advertisement Stone walls surround green shuttered houses and elegant churches During the day the Adriatic sparkles with sunlight while at night the paved streets â polished smooth by thousands of wandering feet â have a shimmer of their own Check out great paintings and colorful markets or take a swim off rocky coves â it neednâ t cost you a cent Get above the city on the Way of the Cross path and the Petka hills Green hills dot the cityâ s outer rim providing a lovely chance to enjoy nature without leaving Dubrovnik For the best views hike up the Way of the Cross path to the top of high SrÄ hill to see the old townâ s terracotta roofs spread beneath you like the palm of a hand Across town the hiking trails on the Petka hills lead through the cool shade of Mediterranean forests up to stunning views of the tiny Grebeni rocks and the mystical Elafiti Islands Planning tip Timing is everything avoid the high sun and come prepared with water sunscreen snacks and a sunhat Fort Lawrence was the filming location for the Red Keep in Game of Thrones Â Benny Marty Shutterstock Explore the real Kingâ s Landing Dubrovnikâ s old town stood in for the great city of Kingâ s Landing

stairs near St Ignatius church where Cerseiâ s infamous â walk of shameâ scene was set heading past the Pile Gate where a crowd threw manure at Joffrey Stroll down to the shore Kingâ s Landingâ s harbor and continue west past Fort Lawrence the Red Keep to serene Gradac Park where Joffrey had a bad wedding experience Wander the open air museum of Dubrovnikâ s old town Dubrovnikâ s old town is the cityâ s greatest sight Its twin drawbridges and mix of medieval Renaissance and Baroque architecture give it a fairy tale feel and as you explore it every square becomes a stage and every view a postcard This was once the center of a trading network that stretched from the Adriatic to the Black Sea Rebuilt after a earthquake its promenades and palaces feel like theyâ ve barely changed in centuries Advertisement Planning tip While thereâ s a fee to climb the famous walls the streets themselves are open to anyone at no cost at all You can watch tourists and locals from the stairs of St Blaiseâ s Church sit on a bench in the picturesque harbor or gaze down at swimmers at Porporela breakwater Take in a Titian at the Cathedral of the Assumption Churches in Dubrovnik display art by local artists and international greats In the Baroque Cathedral you can admire the Assumption of Mary a three paneled century masterpiece by Titian above the main altar The church like most in the city is free though thereâ s a small fee to enter the attached Treasury Other godly highlights include St Ignatius of Loyola Church where stunning Baroque frescoes fill the main apse and St Blaiseâ s Church with colorful stained glass windows by renowned local painter Ivo DulÄ iÄ The knight on the Orlando Column plays an important role in Dubrovnik s system of measurements Â b hide the scene Shutterstock Get your measurements right at the Orlando Column Many of the visitors who mill around cafe packed Sq donâ t give the carved column in the middle a second glance But this statue of an armored knight was once the cityâ s focal point The Orlando Column shows the hero of the Song of Roland a medieval poem that kicked off the whole idea of chivalry Orlando was adopted by Dubrovnik as a heroic savior â and his right forearm became the city stateâ s basic measurement of length the â ell â Enjoy some free nibbles at Grad Market The Grad Market adds a splash of vibrant color to the old town stone every morning Many stalls stock such traditional local sweets as dried figs arancini Croatian candied orange peel and bruÅ tulani mjenduli candied almonds and offer a free taste before you buy Foodies should also venture to the cityâ s main market in which has its own fish market Remember the fallen at Sponza Palace The war that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia left Dubrovnik

ornate year old Sponza Palace has a free Memorial Room that shows the portraits of the young men and women who died defending Dubrovnik during its seven month siege The rocky base of Dubrovikâ s walls offers adrenaline seekers a place for a dive and a dip Â Sandra Mori Shutterstock Sunbathe on the beaches and rocks with the locals The beaches are nearly impossible to privatize around Dubrovnik so even the most popular ones like Banje or Sveti Jakov have room for beachgoers who prefer to put down a towel instead of renting a lounger For sunbathing the way locals do it head to rugged DanÄ e or
