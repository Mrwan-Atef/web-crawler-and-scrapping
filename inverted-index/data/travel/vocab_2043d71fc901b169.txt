wild herbs you can forage in the UK TRAVEL wild herbs you can forage in the UK The UK s green spaces are bursting with plants that add fascinating flavours to dishes You just have to know what can be eaten and where to look Forests in the UK are full of edible treasures Photograph by Tom Bright By Rebecca Boyle March This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Wild greens and herbs have been part of our diet since the dawn of time and it was only at the beginning of the century when food and farming became heavily industrialised that their popularity dropped off In the however they saw a resurgence with high end chefs like Rene Redzepi in Copenhagen Michel Bras in Laguiole France and Dan Barber in New York incorporating hyperlocal foraged ingredients into their menus You don t need to be a chef to take advantage of the many edible treasures in Britain s fields hedgerows woodlands and gardens however just a sense of adventure and unless you have the requisite know how a guide A few tips avoid anywhere near polluted water or heavy traffic or popular with dogs If you have doubts about identifying something especially plants in the wild carrot family which can vary from delicious to deadly poisonous choose a safer option such as nettles or dandelions Here are Britain s herby highlights Yarrow A native herb with fine feathery leaves and a froth of tiny white flowers in summer yarrow grows in meadows and hedgerows James Wood who runs Totally Wild foraging courses across the UK adds the young leaves to potato salad and after flowers appear he uses the leaves in stuffings and stews replacing thyme or rosemary At The Small Holding restaurant in Kent which holds a Green Michelin star you might find sprigs of yarrow dotted on top of ricotta and tomatoes Not suitable for people with aspirin allergy Chickweed Many people think of chickweed as an annoying invader but its dainty leaves are delicious with a flavour like spinach crossed with sweetcorn so if it rampages through your garden eat it up There s a long tradition of doing so with burnt chickweed seeds found at Neolithic sites However it has a nasty lookalike petty spurge but it s easy to tell them apart chickweed has a single line of hairs on each stem Even more obvious if you pull the stem until it snaps you ll see a thin strand or core inside it while spurge has milky sap Alexanders Also known as horse parsley Alexanders arrived with the Romans and it bullies our native bluebells so harvesting it is no bad thing especially in places like Norfolk where it s abundant Although the whole plant is edible with a concentrated celery flavour the seeds are the most exciting part says James They re quite similar to sichuan pepper it s like having masses of wild peppercorns growing unnoticed on our doorsteps Sweet cicely Originally found on European mountainsides sweet cicely can be used in place of fennel Jekka McVicar a herb expert and founder of Jekka s a herb farm in Bristol likes to cook it with rhubarb as the herb s sweetness cuts the amount of sugar needed Sweet cicely could be confused with poisonous hemlock but the former s aniseed scent sets it apart Ground ivy Not be confused with actual ivy ground ivy is a native low growing wild herb related to mint and dead nettles with purple funnel shaped flowers and small slightly hairy leaves which are very fragrant when crushed or chopped It s invasive and one of the UK s most common weeds so light foraging can be helpful to the ecosystem Use the leaves where you might use mint especially in tzatziki or to garnish a gin and tonic Sweet woodruff Once you identify sweet woodruff s star shaped whorl of narrow oval leaves and tiny four petalled white flowers you ll spot it everywhere Jekka uses the almond scented leaves in salads but you can dry them for a more intensely vanilla like flavour and infuse them into drinks They must be dried fast and thoroughly though and kept in an airtight container or they can develop a dangerous toxin Meadowsweet Found in damp lowlands all over the UK meadowsweet has a long history of medicinal use and some people find the leaves smell medicinal too One of the most sacred herbs of the ancient druids its name comes from mead which the flowers were used to flavour Using them in place of elderflower in elderflower champagne brings out notes of hay almond and vanilla This is another herb not suitable for those with an aspirin allergy though Foraging tours in local forest have become a popular pastime with young people Photograph by
