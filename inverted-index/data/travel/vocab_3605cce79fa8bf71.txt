Umm Al Jimal Ruins Jordan Middle East Attractions Lonely Planet Lonely Planet Destinations Planning Inspiration Shop Search Saves Open main menu Shutterstock Ramillah Umm Al Jimal Ruins Jordan Middle East Top choice in Jordan Login Save The unpretentious urban architecture of Umm Al Jimal near the Jordanian Syrian border encompasses more than buildings standing one to three storeys above ground including houses and churches Together these buildings provide a fascinating insight into rural life during the Roman Byzantine and early Islamic periods Compared to other archaeological sites in the region Umm Al Jimal was rarely looted or vandalised which has left much of the original layout intact Comparatively little is known about the ruined city referred to by archaeologists as the Black Gem of the Desert An extensive rural settlement in the lava lands east of Mafraq the ruins are located on the edge of a series of volcanic basalt flows that slope down from Jebel Druze providing high quality building materials The large structure just past the southern entrance is the barracks built by the Romans The towers were added later and like the castle at Azraq it has a swinging basalt door that still functions The barracks chapel was added to the east of the barracks during the Byzantine period around the century and is inscribed with the names of the archangels Gabriel Raphael Michael and Uriel About to the left west of the barracks is what some archaeologists believe is a Nabataean temple because of the altar in the middle About north of the barracks is the Numerianos church one of several ruined Byzantine churches Another to the east is the double church recognisable by its two semicircular naves a wonderful structure that was renovated and extended several times over the centuries About to the right east is house XVII whose double door entrance interior courtyard fine corbelled ceilings decorated doorways and carved pillars indicate that it was built by a wealthy family A few metres to the south is the sheikh s house notable for its expansive courtyard stables black basalt door and stairways Look for the gravity defying stairs to the north and the precarious corner tower You can just make out a double stairway to the east of the courtyard After exiting the building you get a good view of the lovely arched window and vaulted semicircular basement in the exterior eastern wall About north of the double church steps lead down to the main reservoir one of several around the city Less than to the left west is house XIII originally a stable for domestic goats and sheep and later renovated and used as a residence by Druze settlers Here take notice of the stone ventilation screen which was used to separate the manger from the living space To the west about is the cathedral built in about AD but now mostly in ruins look for the lintel stone detailing the Roman emperors that ruled over the region The praetorium military headquarters is less than to the southwest Built in the late century AD by the Romans it was extended by the Byzantines and features a triple doorway About to the north through one of the old city gates is the west church easily identifiable by its four arches and ornate Byzantine crosses Read more Suggest an edit to this attraction Lonely Planet s must see attractions Temple of Artemis MILES Dedicated to
