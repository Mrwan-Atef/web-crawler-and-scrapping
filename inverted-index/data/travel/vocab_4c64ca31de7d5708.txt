Why Mongolia should be your next wellness escape TRAVEL Why Mongolia should be your next wellness escape Barren yet beautiful the moonscapes of Mongolia s Gobi Desert are an alluring world of steppes boreal forest sand and rock Here visitors can bookend their days with yoga and Buddhist teachings camp under brilliant night skies and ride with some of the last nomadic people on Earth Mongolia s Gobi Desert is a remote and seemingly inhospitable place but the Ikh Nart Nature Reserve on the desert s north edge plays host to a thrilling wellness break Photograph by Richard I Anson Awl Images Ltd By Jane Dunford December This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK I scramble up the rocks as my guide Nergui silently beckons me forward He s motioning to something on a granite outcrop ahead I squint and adjust my binoculars until it comes into view a young cinereous vulture with beady black eyes and a curved beak is peeking over its nest Overhead a larger bird circles below us the vast boulder strewn moonscape stretches as far as the eye can see Mongolia s Gobi Desert is a remote and seemingly inhospitable place The vast sense of space and emptiness is all encompassing but as Nergui is showing me Ikh Nart Nature Reserve on the desert s north edge is very much alive Summer rainfall has stirred the landscape bright green alliums carpet the ground and temporary ponds provide water for migratory birds and wildlife We sit in silence scanning the horizon for some of the desert s native animals such as ibex big horned argali sheep and gazelles I m pleased to learn that the wolves won t be back until winter Six times the size of Britain but home to fewer than million people Mongolia is the least densely populated country in the world Sandwiched between Russia and China it s an otherworldly mosaic of steppes arid desert valleys and forested mountains where people have lived a largely nomadic pastoral lifestyle for centuries Perhaps it s not the first place one might think of for a yoga sojourn but that s why I m here on a day retreat with Reclaim Yourself which combines authentic adventures with a twice daily practice Off grid with a group of just people I ll be learning about local life with various hosts and herders and staying in two traditional ger nomadic Mongolian yurt camps both dismantled each season to leave no trace Our journey begins in Ulaanbaatar Mongolia s sprawling capital As we drive from the airport the vast open landscapes gradually give way to a cityscape dominated by Soviet style tower blocks and congested roads Mongolia under Communist rule for years until still bears the imprint of that era in its stark architecture Today over a third of the population resides here and with urban migration on the rise the infrastructure is straining to keep up As I walk along the streets I soon find myself warming to its softer edges children cycle through fountains on Sukhbaatar square teenagers skateboard in the park groups of friends fill karaoke bars and diners tuck into meaty Korean barbecue Shopping malls have whole floors dedicated to cashmere the National Museum sweeps visitors from Neolithic times to the century and the Choijin Lama Temple Museum in the centre of town is one of the few monasteries saved from destruction during the Stalinist era Khongor Sand Dunes in Gobi Gurvan Saikhan National Park are known as the Singing Sands Photograph by ClickAlps Awl Images Built by the Soviets in Ulaanbaatar train station is the largest in the country It s a square hulk of a building with a plain facade and columned entrance inside chandeliers dangle in the waiting room and loud announcements boom over the speaker We re here to catch the Trans Mongolian Express which runs all the way to Beijing on a seven hour journey into the desert When the train trundles onto the platform an instructor in a neat uniform ushers us to our compartments and it s not long before we embark into the flat emerald openness of the steppe I gaze out of the window as the hours slip by the vast horizon broken only by the occasional white ger campsite Free roaming camels along with herds of horses and sheep dot the landscape and a fiery sunset streaks the sky pink and orange Near midnight we step off into what feels like the middle of nowhere Heavy rain has opened gulleys in the desert floor and our transfer by an old Russian bus becomes an adventure as we twist and turn across an unmarked landscape trying to access our camp Finally we arrive under a black velvet sky the stars hanging so low I feel I could reach up and pluck one The silence is like nothing I ve experienced before Into the wild The following day we wake to a cloudless blue morning and are introduced to our guide Nergui who manages the camp for Nomadic Journeys a company that focuses on low impact tourism and supporting conservation initiatives on the ground He s spent the last summers out here in the Gobi Desert with his family and his wife Ouynzul is head chef The camp is an idyllic arc of a dozen white ger a central one used as our yoga shala space with classes led by London based Zephyr Wildman bookending our days We slow down breathe and move through asana postures with lessons fused with Buddhist teachings on being in the moment and the art of letting go The movement and meditation complement the vast stillness of the landscape and the lack of news and noise soon begins to seep into my body and soul Travellers to the Mongolian desert stay in a ger a sturdy portable dwelling strong enough to stand Mongolia s fierce spring winds Photograph by Francesco Vaninetti Photo Getty Images Horsetrekking is a popular way to witness the Mongolian steppe Photograph by Matteo Carta Alamy Stock Photo This area I discover has long been a centre of Buddhism Humans have been living here in the desert for thousands of years On our daily guided walks with Nergui the landscape reveals its secrets in stages We pass ancient burial mounds and find a Bronze Age arrow tip and fragments of pottery hidden among bleached animal bones littering the ground One evening as the clouds glow rose gold Nergui takes us to see petroglyphs on a rock close to the camp A man with a spear a camel and an ibex are all clearly visible It s this rich history which fascinates me says Nergui Millions of years ago this whole area was under the sea yet traces of life from every era remain Archaeologists uncover new discoveries every year About of Mongolia s population still live a nomadic lifestyle and in this reserve around families continue to roam moving with their animals throughout the year he continues It s common to see camel herders passing by our camp although there are fewer these days Many people have moved to town or gone to work in the mines The following evening we delve deeper into the desert passing surreal rock formations and gargantuan sand dunes before arriving at Elstei a sacred Buddhist site The name translates to with sand due to the ribbons weaving between its towering rocks and it s thought that monks once came here to meditate The well loved Buddhist mantra Om Mani Padme Hum meaning The jewel is in the lotus is etched into the wall At my feet a lizard skits across the ground a fox disappears into a cave and a kestrel hangs in the air Though no one lives here now the desert feels more alive than ever The rocks form a natural amphitheatre where we feast outdoors on homemade curry before climbing the higher peaks to take in sweeping sunset views Gathering in a circle we join in meditation to honour the elements and later sat around a fire under a star studded sky our hosts sing traditional Mongolian ballads celebrating family bonds and the power of Mother Nature Flames leap and voices soar guttural notes I don t understand but that still seem to penetrate my soul To the river Our next stop is a full day s drive north on the banks of the River Tuul in the Khan Khentii Strictly Protected Area En route it feels like the saturation has been turned up to full as we re enveloped by the vivid blue and green gold landscape Though the scenery shifts the vastness and absence of people remain constant In some areas it resembles a Mad Max film set with mines and cement plants dotting the horizon giving the landscape a dystopian feel Bactrian camels are bred by nomadic herders in the Gobi Desert and are used primarily for transportation Photograph by Timothy Allen Getty Images Some miles east of Ulaanbaatar on the riverbank our journey is broken up with a pit stop at Tsonjin Boldog a towering metre stainless steel statue of the legendary warrior Genghis Khan on horseback The world s tallest equestrian statue the site was unveiled in to mark the anniversary of the founding of the Mongol Empire which once spanned over nine million square miles Today visitors can climb up through the horse s chest and neck to the head for far reaching views of the surrounding countryside It s not long before we re back in our jeeps off roading across the plains and rolling hills The swollen River Tuul has burst its banks so we traverse flooded tracks into wildflower covered valleys speckled with flocks of sheep and goats Our camp Nomadic Journeys Jalman Meadows Wilderness is an idyllic spot with gers set in pretty meadows with the River Tuul gushing by A yak and cart transfer our luggage to our new homes It s raining outside but inside the ger a central log burner keeps us warm These round white structures insulated with felt are integral to Mongolian life packed up and transported on the backs of camels as nomads move from place to place Inside it s a riot of colours wooden spokes and beds are intricately painted with every design carrying a different meaning Each morning we rise early to blankets of mist swirling magically in the valley while days unfurl at an easy pace punctuated by yoga massage a therapist travels with us offering treatments and delicious meals Chef Richie is from the UK but works with the Mongolian team to conjure up vegetarian feasts unusual amid the meat heavy local diet Down by the river we heat up in a sauna tent and before plunging into icy water watched nonchalently by grazing yaks The camp also offers kayaking and rafting but the river is too full and fast during our stay so we stick to the land With degree views from camp we watch the weather roll in walls of rain and lightning followed by sparkling sun and rainbows I quickly learn that the Khan Khentii Strictly Protected Area is a haven for hiking There are no marked trails in this vast wilderness but with a guide we walk through the lush flower filled grasslands and up into the woods This transition zone from steppe to boreal forest is home to plentiful wildlife from wolves to bears and the air is fresh and sweet The most important activity of all however is horse riding The Choijin Lama Temple Museum is a Buddhist monastery in Ulaanbaatar the capital of Mongolia Photograph by Andrey Khrobostov Alamy Stock Photo Of the five livestock animals native to Mongolia camel sheep goats cows and horse the horse is king says Jagaa a local herder who s taking us trekking Dressed in a pale traditional deel and long boots he s rounded up some of his semi wild herd and we set off across the wildflower speckled meadows It s an idyllic way to explore and all but complete novices can be catered for Jagaa s six year old son Jackar accompanies us his little legs high on the saddle but he rides with mastery putting my posture to shame Horse racing is also highly revered here it s one of the three masculine sports alongside wrestling and archery which feature in July s Naadam festival a focal point in the Mongolian calendar While the biggest celebrations take place in Ulaanbaatar s National Sports Stadium festivities are held in villages across the country Jagaa is happy that his horses ridden by his brother won several prizes in the local tournament this year I learn that Jagaa grew up on this land as did his ancestors moving camp several times a year with their animals He sells meat and dairy products Mare s milk becomes kumis traditional fermented alcohol the sheep provide wool and the goats cashmere Nomadic life he tells me is getting harder Climate change is affecting the grassland and severe winters known as dzud winter disasters are becoming more frequent killing many animals There s pressure too to become settled farmers and raise larger numbers of livestock It s not an easy life and I m not sure how it will continue he explains But living in a nomadic way in nature is a blessing One evening we re invited to Jagaa s family home located close to our camp His year old daughter Maral welcomes us into the ger with salty milky tea and hard cheese more is hanging up to dry pegged out on a washing line inside Today s nomads have TVs and mobile phones and Maral is dressed in a yellow TikTok T shirt It feels like the collision of two worlds where the past lives alongside the present In the winter she like her siblings stays in dorms at school in the local village but for the summer she s back to help They teach me that shamanism has long been Mongolia s dominant religion and today Buddhism mixes easily with a type of nature worship We believe that everything has a spirit there needs to be balance for nature to be happy explains Jagaa I m worried about how the spirits of the land will cope with the changes That evening in my yoga session I find myself contemplating what a privilege it is to be in such a wild place to be welcomed by these gentle people and to witness this precious pastoral lifestyle As the wind plays havoc with the ger door and a cricket joins in as we chant I realise how easy it is to forget the rest of the world here to sink into the simple rhythms of nature away from screens I m certainly in no hurry to return home How to do it Reclaim Yourself s
