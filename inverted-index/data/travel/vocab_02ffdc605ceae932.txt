Peruvian Andes the Inca ruins of Choquequirao are reachable only on foot for now Photograph by Victor Zea National Geographic One of the most remote Inca sites in the Peruvian Andes the ruins of Choquequirao are reserved for the hardy Those who make the trek can do so only on foot zigzagging up and down vertiginous paths for miles before accessing the sprawling complex suspended at feet between the high Andes and the jungles below Many myths exist around Choquequirao says Gori Tumi Echevarría an archaeologist who first worked at the ruins in Its many temples terraces and plazas have yet to be fully excavated Among the ancient city s most intriguing features the Llama Terraces named for the two dozen nearly life size llama images that cascade down the face of a series of steep terraces The llamas are formed from quartzlike white rocks that vividly stand out against the dark schist background unique stone artwork found at no other Inca site Explore Inca life beyond Machu Picchu on this South American trail There is nothing else like this in the Andes It was graphic innovation that occurred prior to the century and was not repeated says Echevarría who specializes in prehistoric rock art But change is coming to rock the cradle of gold the meaning of Choquequirao in the Indigenous Quechua language New infrastructure plans are expected to boost visitation to Machu Picchu s sister city Pre pandemic Machu Picchu had more than million visitors annually according to Peruvian tourism officials Choquequirao counted less than To increase accessibility the Peruvian government has committed to spending million to build a cable car spanning three miles between the town of Kiuñalla and the archaeological site See what it takes to do the high altitude trek to Choquequirao Development may create more economic opportunities for locals at the expense of Choquequirao s serenity For now however the site feels like a sanctuary sheltered from the century and one that still calls out to any adventure traveler s imagination Austrian Alps Connect with the Alps most charming villages A prime winter sports destination Austria s Carinthia region is home to several mountaineering villages in the Bergsteigerdörfer network Photograph by Alamy Stock Photo To save a mountain range it sometimes takes a village Since an association of high altitude hamlets located in Central Europe s Eastern Alps has banded together to promote their small communities to the world s adventure travelers interested in mountain hiking biking and climbing as well as winter sports like cross country skiing and ice climbing Called the Bergsteigerdörfer or the Mountaineering Villages the network is concentrated primarily in Austria s western states including Tyrol and Carinthia with additional member towns in Switzerland Germany Italy and Slovenia The Bergsteigerdörfer works to protect the culture and traditions of its villages while preserving mountain landscapes from overdevelopment Rejecting large scale tourist projects like sprawling ski lodges and peak scaling cable cars the Bergsteigerdörfer puts greater emphasis on green or sustainable mountain tourism Here s where to find epic adventure in Europe s best small villages We re not big and bigger or tall and taller We appeal to people wanting a more authentic alpine experience says Barbara Reitler of the Austrian Alpine Association The Bergsteigerdorfer website highlights a changing assortment of towns where for example hikers can stay in a farmer s house or try traditional foods like sterz a hearty porridge that s immensely satisfying after a long day in the mountains Reitler s favorite village is Johnsbach in Gesäuse National Park with its dramatic views When you come through the Enns Valley along the river and suddenly see the peaks of the Gesäuse Mountains you have emerged into a different world Revillagigedo National Park Mexico Dive into the Galápagos of Mexico The resident bottlenose dolphins of Mexico s Revillagigedo National Park frequently show curiosity toward divers Photograph by Enric Sala Nat Geo Image Collection Some miles off the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula lies a national park steeped in superlatives Revillagigedo National Park a square mile Mexican marine reserve is North America s largest fully protected underwater park It offers sanctuary to the continent s greatest concentration of tropical marine megafauna from hammerhead sharks to humpback whales earning it the nickname the Galápagos of Mexico And the waters surrounding its four main islands are fast becoming a mecca for scuba divers The park is one of the few places if not the only place on the planet that you can have intimate interaction with giant oceanic mantas says marine biologist and underwater filmmaker Erick Higuera He says the mantas which can weigh up to pounds and attain a wingspan of feet seem to like the feel of the divers air bubbles on their bellies Get up close with wildlife in Baja California s Magdalena Bay The bottlenose dolphins that inhabit the park s waters also show curiosity often swimming up to investigate divers The proximity you have with wild bottlenose dolphins is insane Higuera says As species we re both curious about each other To minimize disruptions to the animals the park limits the number of boats and divers allowed daily It is not uncommon to reserve space on a Revillagigedo diving boat up to two years in advance And remember always keep a respectful distance from sea life Go with Nat Geo Snorkel amid sea lions king
