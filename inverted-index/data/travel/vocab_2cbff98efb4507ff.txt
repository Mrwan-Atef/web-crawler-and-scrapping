What is poitín Ireland s beloved national spirit Connemara coffee a cocktail consisting of freshly brewed coffee whipped cream and Connemara Irish cream liqueur with poitin is made on a turf fire Photograph by Ciara n MacChoncarraige TRAVEL Why it s time to try poitín Ireland s beloved national spirit Illegal for over years poitín went legit in and was granted protected status a decade later But only now thanks to passionate distillers and creative mixologists has its renaissance really gathered momentum By Susanne Masters Photographs by Ciara n MacChoncarraige July This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Eight years ago a friend of mine who d grown up in County Fermanagh led me to a cave behind a waterfall which housed a secret There my torch light illuminated an old pot still a relic that would have once been used for the illegal distillation of the historic Irish spirit poitín I remember thinking how difficult it must have been to heave it over the slippery rocks Poitín has come a long way since the days of illicit stills hidden in caves Its forerunner aqua vitae was originally distilled by monks but by the century after the dissolution of the monasteries the spirit move into community production distilled in households across rural Ireland In the British Crown introduced an alcohol tax a move which resulted in the emergence of two distinct spirits parliament whiskey a taxed legal spirit that was matured in barrels and the untaxed illegal poitín its name derived from the Irish word for small pot a reference to the pot stills used to make it Illegality did little to dent its popularity however and poitín continued to be produced illicitly in stills hidden in back rooms out buildings forests and even in caves behind waterfalls It was initially made from malted barley but later from other fermentable crops including sugar beet and potatoes Then in more than three centuries after it was first outlawed Ireland s beloved moonshine became legitimate when the Irish Revenue Commissioners withdrew their opposition to its sale It was in that I had my first taste of poitín and I admit to dismissing it as rough So as I go to sip a shot of Micil s Heritage Poitín it s with some trepidation at ABV I m expecting it to be a little raucous But I m surprised Not only is there a welcome touch of sweetness but also a pleasant oiliness that makes it a smooth sip This I m told comes from the addition of oats along with barley in the initial fermentation Micil Distillery offers a variety of tours showcasing the distillery s range of gin whiskey Irish cream and poitín Photography by Ciara n MacChoncarraige With its wooden panels shelves full of bottles and the comforting aromas of fermentation Micil Distillery in Salthill on the shore of Galway Bay is something of an oasis and it feels symbolic of how far poitín has come Maker of gin whiskey and Irish cream as well as poitín the distillery offers a variety of tours for mine visitor centre manager Tom Doran expertly puts the company s range neatly into a historic and geographic context At one point I find myself holding a brick of peat traditionally the principal fuel used in poitín distillation and marvelling at how light it feels Towards the end of the tour we re joined by founder and director Pádraic Ó Griallais a sixth generation distiller who speaks Irish as his first language and who learnt distilling from his moonshining grandfather With a glance at the distillery s bulky equipment I ask him how his ancestors managed to keep their operations secret He explains how County Galway s terrain offered shelter After each distillation run the still was dismantled and parts would have been buried in bog holes he explains This environment actually kept the still clean the water would be slightly acidic Fermentation vessels were concealed using scraw the top layer of vegetation and some turf as camouflage Typically barrels were placed in a recess in a small hill to give natural coverage Malting brewing and distilling took place on commonage land with multiple shareholders so it was very difficult to prove ownership of an illicit still unless the distiller was caught red handed The legalisation of poitín brought with it many changes particularly a move towards indoor distillation Open air production methods allowed bacteria to enter the wash as it fermented Pádraic explains These days we leave our fermenters open to allow bacteria to naturally enter the wash and fermentation vessels rest for two to three days after fermentation to emulate outdoor conditions This gives greater depth of flavour and fruity characteristics known as esters Pádraic points out that poitín distillation is also now a year round affair Traditionally distillers stopped producing in summer as alcohol yields were not as good due to the prevalence of competing wild yeast and wild bacteria he says Most distillers were farmers too which meant other summer duties saving hay turf and crops had to be prioritised Long days were also impractical for illicit distillers trying to avoid the authorities long winter nights were preferred for discretion Cutting turf for heritage poitín is now a year round affair for founder and director of Micil Distillery Pádraic Ó Griallais Photograph by Ciara n MacChoncarraige Cocktail culture In along with Irish whiskey and Irish cream Irish poitín was given Geographic Indication status by the European Union and in the spirit had its production methods codified by the Irish Government And while it s taken two decades for the newly legalised industry to really find its feet today it s exported to numerous countries worldwide with the Irish Government predicting the level of exports will hit one million cases in One of the brands spearheading this revival is Bán Poitín Made with barley Comber potatoes and Irish grain it was founded by poitín enthusiast Dave Mulligan whose fascination with the spirit was first kindled by a gift from his father He bought me a bottle as congratulations for opening my first bar in he explains When I asked him why he said poitín was always for the big moments in life I enjoyed drinking it with him while he told me tales about growing up around poitín and how important it was People think it was a cheap alternative to whiskey But there was a period where people rejected whiskey because it was made by the Crown and the craft of the poitín maker was widely preferred I love the history of booze and cocktails and I was thinking why is no one telling this story I became a bit obsessed and did it myself In addition to Bán Poitín Dave also owns Bar in Dublin which channels the spirit of the country s rebellious illicit distillers by declaring itself staunchly Irish and fiercely independent The venue is playing its part in introducing the spirit to a wider audience by showcasing its potential as a cocktail ingredient One of its best selling concoctions is Belfast coffee in which Bán Poitín is combined with cold brew coffee cream demerara and nutmeg It s basically a cold brewed Irish coffee Dave explains It s a cocktail that s easy to understand and it s so delicious Across Bar s vast menu a third of the cocktails contain poitín And while Bán Poitín is also used in creations such as the flat iron other brands get a look in too In golden moment for example Mad March Hare poitín is mixed with an apple aperitif grapefruit and champagne to produce a cocktail that Dave says illustrates how elegant poitín can be Mulroy Bay poitín is combined with Lost Irish whiskey in the lost Irish cocktail which tastes of carrot cake without being oversweet And Teeling poitín is mixed with vermouth mead and marmalade bitters for the fragrant spritz paperwork Dave speaks highly of his fellow poitín pioneers noting the craft of Pádraic of Micil Distillery John Ralph of Mad March Hare which at ABV is easy to mix and Brendan Carty of Killowen Distillery which uses old fashioned processes to produce its poitín He also praises Jennifer Nickerson of Tipperary Distillery adding that a wider return of women to the industry is overdue It was generally the women who distilled at home as they would have a had a little pot still on the stove But after it was made illegal it became male dominated During the years in which distilling poitín for sale in Ireland was illegal the spirit continued to be made just in secret Legalising poitín opened the door for people outside of the friends family and local community around distillers to taste and appreciate it And now for travellers to Ireland it s really time to seek it out and take a taste of Irish history Getting there Trainline offer Rail
