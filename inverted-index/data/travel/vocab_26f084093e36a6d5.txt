Jul min read Share Annemarie at one of the many miradors viewpoints on the Azores Â Lonely Planet editor AnneMarie McCarthy recently returned from a jam packed week in the Azores exploring four different islands in days As the lucky destination editor in charge of Lonely Planetâ s Portugal coverage I can tell you one thing with absolute certainty you all love the Azores Week after week I see how readers like you are reading up on these green islands which all your well traveled friends are raving about Advertisement When I got an invite from Visit Azores I quickly packed up my rain jacket and sunscreen to check it out the archipelago for myself Over the course of a week I visited the islands of SÃ o Miguel Pico Faial and Terceira traveling between them mainly by plane but also by ferry What was the most touristy thing you did The most touristy activity I did was also my favorite a dolphin and whale watching tour that set out from from Ponta Delgada on SÃ o Miguel Iâ ve never had much luck with wildlife spotting but since the Azores is one of the best places in the world for spotting cetaceans I was optimistic Between April and early July is an optimal time to set off since the whales are on their annual migration and there are more species in the surrounding water During nearly hours at sea we saw dolphins orcas sperm whales and pilot whales All the whales kept their distance â but the dolphins got up close chasing each other in front of the boat On board the Futurismo boat we saw dolphins in the water Â AnneMarie McCarthy There are a limited number of companies in Azores with a license for this activity and they all operate under strict â rules of engagementâ â such as never approaching the animals from the front and keeping a reasonable distance the more vessels in the area the further away they all have to be None of this affects your chances of seeing them however I went with Futurismo which offers two to three trips a day The team is so confident you will have a successful sighting that if you happen to be unlucky you can take a subsequent tour for free What was the handiest thing you packed My rain jacket Although the sun did shine a lot showers would blow through with little warning The weather forecast on the islands is often not reliable â and when youâ re spending so much time outside on hikes you will want to be prepared for all eventualities A lightweight waterproof jacket will mean you can hike for hours without fear Rain is always a possibility on the Azores but it can make for atmospheric pictures Â AnneMarie McCarthy Yet no matter how well prepared you are never hike off trail since you run the risk of damaging delicate endemic vegetation Whatâ s more wild camping is not allowed anywhere on the islands Youâ ll always be close to somewhere official to stay Whatâ s your favorite photo from the trip and where was it taken This shot was taken at the bottom of a dormant volcano Algar do CarvÃ o There are only three places in the world you can go inside one of these Indonesia Iceland and here in the center of Terceira island While you have to pass through a short tunnel to reach the interior being inside doesnâ t feel claustrophobic as you can look up to the sky above Advertisement The view from iside Algar do Carvao the Azores dormant volcano Â AnneMarie McCarthy You can also explore further into the caves to take in their cathedral like spaces all formed from volcanic stone For something truly unique occasional concerts take place here Best tip for someone who wants to plan the same trip Concentrate on fewer islands or come for longer Since the Azores lie in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean the temptation to island hop is strong particularly in the summer when travelers are less likely to be affected by poor weather and subsequent plane and ferry cancellations I would recommend sticking with two islands that suit your travel style for each week youâ re in the Azores You could stretch this to three depending on the size and proximity of the islands you fancy Pico is very small for example and is only an hour for Faial by ferry making for a faster and more convenient trip than the plane From the Cella Bar in Pico you can see Faial across the water Â AnneMarie McCarthy The Azores are all about the outdoors and good food â and every island has both in abundance Almost everywhere you stay will be peaceful Which is why youâ ll get the most out of your visit here when you have time to relax and soak it all in Where did you stay What was the vibe With a lot of island hopping came a lot of lovely hotels all of which brought something different In SÃ o Miguel the nature themed Senhora da Rosa was lovely with an outdoor pool and rooms decor inspired by the local landscape The on site restaurant Magma provided a great last meal of my trip The rooms in Picoâ s Aldeia da Fonte Hotel are in buildings made of volcanic rock â yet they somehow all reminded me of an American summer camp at least like Iâ ve seen on television On the property is a sea walk complete with a terrace to watch the waves and a ladder to get down into the cove to swim Itâ s a great place to relax after a day of climbing Mt Pico The colourful murals on Faial harbor are left by boat passing through Â AnneMarie McCarthy Faialâ s Hotel do Canal is right on the pier making it perfect for exploring the bright colorful murals left by sailors over the centuries And itâ s within view of the famous Peter CafÃ Sport where the lemon gin and tonic is never a bad idea Quinta da Nasce Ã gua in Terceira is just a minute walk from the historic center of Angra do Heroismo but feels like itâ s in the countryside The staff was incredibly welcoming here And in fact everywhere I stayed Best thing you ate This one is too tough I enjoyed incredible food all week ranging from the very traditional to the inventive This being Portugal you can expect a meat heavy menu â although I did have the best mushroom risotto of my life at Sensi Azores Hotel Itâ s essential to try a cozido das Furnas an array of meats arranged in a clay pot that gets buried then cooked and flavored by the geothermal heat of volcanic activity I watched the cozido pots getting collected from Furnas Lake â before tucking into mine at nearby institution Tonyâ s On the left mushroom risotto at the Sensi Azores Nature Spa hotel On the right a seasonal fish dish at Santa BÃ rbara Eco Resort Â AnneMarie McCarthy Other memorable meals were at Picoâ s famous Cella Bar where on a windy day I had wine tapas and a view of Faial Donâ t leave Terceira without trying the islandâ s famous Dona AmÃ lia a sticky spicy cake In fact each island has its own signature pastry Iâ d also recommend Quinta do Martelo â s alcatra a comfort stew cooked in a clay pot with wine simmering long and slow until the meat practically melts Did I mention the food was good in the Azores AnneMarie McCarthy visited the Azores at the
