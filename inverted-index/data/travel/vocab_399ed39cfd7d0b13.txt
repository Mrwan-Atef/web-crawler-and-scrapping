wizened olive groves and austere cypresses of Provence and you ll start to realize you can t shake off a sense of déjà vu If you re feeling as though you ve been here before it s because you re wandering through the inspirations for the paintings of Van Gogh Picasso Cezanne and Matisse The post impressionists were captivated by Provence for the very same reasons we still are today The appeal of the crumbling farmhouses with terracotta roof tiles infinite lavender fields and hazy cobalt mountains rolling down to pastures where cicadas chirp is timeless Stroll in the footsteps of the artists contemplate the café terraces in the town of Arles immortalized by Van Gogh wander the fortified medieval settlement of St Paul de Vence that enchanted Bonnard Signac and Modigliani or explore the bucolic scenery in and around Aix en Provence celebrated by Cezanne To get into the spirit of the artists maybe sip one of their favorite aperitifs such as pastis or if you re really feeling the bohemian vibe chase the green fairy with some real absinthe in the numerous wine cellars just don t go losing an ear over it Provence is a dream for epicures The foundation of most Provencal dishes typically includes herbs that grow wild here such as rosemary and thyme and simple seasonal ingredients like olive oil peppers anchovies tomatoes basil and garlic From these basic ingredients the peasant food of Provence has blossomed into world famous exports such as ratatouille hearty daube stew and heavenly bouillabaisse Of course you need to wash this delicious cuisine down with the local specialty a chilled glass of dry crisp Provencal rosé Wine lovers will find caves and vineyards almost everywhere and if you prefer red wine a detour to the beautiful village and weather beaten terroir of Châteauneuf du Pape is a must Catch the iconic lavender fields at their most vibrant in June and July the Romanesque abbey of Senanque is one of the best known locations While winters can be blustery in early spring follow the yellow blossoms of the Route du Mimosa from Bormes les Mimosas to Grasse Grasse is the world capital of perfume where you can inhale the scents of Provencal wildflowers at the perfumeries and soak up the sights of the picturesque town including the century cathedral which contains works by Reubens Explore the historic highlights of Provence too like the well preserved Roman aqueduct of Pont du Gard Avignon s imposing century Palais des Papes and the century pont and the Roman amphitheaters at Arles and Orange Grasse St Paul de Vence and Gordes are some of the most hyped hilltop communes in the region but despite what many guidebooks would lead you to believe Provence is up to its eyeballs in quaint fortified villages So you don t actually need to fight your way through the crowds of tourists and crafts stalls to find a quintessential Provençal hilltop village that ll make your heart skip a beat But you will need a car to find one Take off under your own steam and discover intriguing villages or Roman remains follow maze like Medieval streets watch pensioners play pétanque browse local honey and artichoke flowers at farmers markets or maybe even join a truffle hunting excursion to find black gold Whether you decide to go off piste or not hiring a vehicle is essential because even the most quintessential attractions are geographically isolated However if you d like to leave your wheels behind for a day there are limited bus and train connections including Eurostar TGV connections at Aix en Provence and Avignon and the stunning scenic Train des Pignes between Nice and Dignes les Baines Just don t count on public transport as your primary mode of transportation because rural services are patchy and slow although long distance carpooling with BlaBlaCar can work for one offs If you re a gearhead check out the endless hairpins and dizzying ft drops of one of the most challenging roads in Europe according to TopGear in the Gorges du Verdon On that note while the rosemary scented landscapes of the Luberon and Var are what people typically imagine when they think of Provence the Provence Alpes Côte d Azur region is much larger than you d think and has plenty more to offer adrenaline junkies and culture aficionados alike Go canyoning or kayaking on the sublime turquoise waters of the Verdon scuba dive in the pristine Îles de Lérins hang glide or ski over the southernmost tip of the Alps at Auron party at the glamorous beach clubs of the Cote d Azur discover street art in Marseille hike the stunning coastal trail in Antibes plunge into the crystal clear calanques around Cassis and watch wild horses gallop across the wetlands of the Camargue Provence remains a timeless region but you can paint a
