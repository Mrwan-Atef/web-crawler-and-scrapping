Hester Underhill July min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK The Catalan saying amb la panxa buida no hi ha alegria you can t be happy if your stomach is empty neatly sums up the Barcelonian attitude to dining Food is more than just fuel it s a joyful celebration of tradition and an expression of fierce regional identity And as any Catalan is quick to point out while you can find tapas here it s not native to the area Instead the local cuisine centres around larger dishes like mongetes amb botifarra pork sausage with beans calçots chargrilled green onions with romesco sauce and esqueixada salt cod salad that have been shaped by Catalonia s position between mountains and sea Like the city itself Barcelona s dining scene is a heady mix of historic and contemporary regional and international There has long been a sizeable South American population and recent years have seen a surge in Latino chefs launching new ventures in the city such as Mexican Paco Méndez s restaurant Come Argentinian Francisco Seubert s bakery Coush Armó and Venezuelan Juan Martini s grill joints Fat Barbies and Fat Veggies Elsewhere storied institutions that have served Catalan classics since the days of Gaudí stand alongside natural wine bars And while the pandemic did force a handful of beloved local restaurants to close their doors the majority of casualties were more tourist leaning spots in the historic centre the closures of which made way for more exciting independent ventures At the crest of this new wave is a crop of young chefs and restaurateurs putting a contemporary spin on regional cuisine One of the most celebrated examples is seafood restaurant Besta which opened in with a menu showcasing a refined mix of Catalan and Galician influences There s
