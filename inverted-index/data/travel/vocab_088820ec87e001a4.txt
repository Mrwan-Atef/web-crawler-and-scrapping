a backdrop to the town of La Fortuna Bailey Johnson for Lonely Planet If soaking in a world class collection of naturally heated hot springs overlooking one of Latin Americaâ s most iconic volcanos sounds like a good idea and why wouldnâ t it you might want to immediately point your GPS and your weary traveler bones toward the jaw dropping eco paradise that is Costa Rica â s Volcan Arenal Towering above a famously biodiverse acre expanse of lush rainforest located around miles north of the bustling capital city of San Jose Arenal is a popular natural getaway offering relaxation and outdoor adventure From rope swings and zip lines to public swimming holes and star resort spas a trip to Arenal can be laid back or adrenaline fueled Arenal Volcano on a sunny day Getty Images When should I go to VolcÃ n Arenal Costa Rica has two distinct seasons wet and dry Youâ ll most likely want to visit during the dry or â highâ season from December to April when the weather is at its best and the sun is mostly out note sunscreen is a must either way Advertisement But if you donâ t mind the extra rain and dark skies the wet or â greenâ season from May to November offers less expensive rates and fewer crowds Keep in mind that the volcano is often partly or fully obscured by clouds so high season offers your best chance to catch a glimpse of the near perfectly cone shaped volcano in all its glory where a backdrop of rainbows or fiery red sunsets are not uncommon It does get quite hot and humid by April but the good thing is youâ re never far away from a pool hot or cold How much time should I spend in VolcÃ n Arenal Arenal is a popular weekend getaway for Ticos local Costa Ricans while most international visitors tend to stay a few extra days in the region to take in all the sights and activities That said itâ s not unusual for travelers to spend the day as there are daily buses shuttles and flights from San Jose If like most visitors you also want to check out the legendary and breathtakingly gorgeous turquoise blue waters of nearby Rio Celeste â located in Parque Nacional Volcan Tenorio a roughly minute drive from Arenalâ s lively gateway town of La Fortuna â youâ ll want to stay overnight Is it easy to get in and around VolcÃ n Arenal Bus service departure times can be unreliable so book shuttles or tours from one of the many outfitters offering transport and guided excursions from San Jose Taxis and rideshares are also plentiful in Arenal with rideshare significantly less expensive but if youâ re traveling to a remote destination around the region get your rideshare driverâ s phone number to arrange a cash pickup for the way back Natural hot springs at Tabacon Julen Arabaolaza Shutterstock Top things to do at VolcÃ n Arenal Soak in natural hot springs overlooking Arenal volcano The one experience every Arenal traveler seeks is a restorative soak in the healing waters of some of the regionâ s celebrated hot springs located in and around Arenal Volcano National Park There are seemingly endless options when it comes to hot springs from free public springs like El Choyin to the more upscale tubs found throughout higher end resorts like A day pass will set you back US at but the water is warmer with the vibe more romantic while the free public springs boast more of a bring your own party group feel Advertisement Kid friendly Baldi Hot Springs is another popular resort soak while the free rope swing at El Salto is a must for those looking to swing in on a vine like Tarzan and plunge into naturally heated waters beside a peaceful flowing waterfall Planning tip Bring water shoes to the free hot springs as the ground is quite rocky Marvel at the stunning turquoise blue waters of RÃ o Celeste Next on the Arenal bucket list is a side trip to the staggeringly scenic RÃ o Celeste waterfall fed by a postcard perfect turquoise blue river in nearby Tenorio Volcano National Park Walk the main trail about steps down to the waterfall and if you have good shoes and a sense of adventure continue to some of the nearby trails This is a popular area so it s unlikely you ll have the waterfall all to yourself The hanging bridges at Mistico Park near La Fortuna Shutterstock Get a birdâ s eye view of the rainforest on a zip line or hanging bridge More than a dozen hanging bridges and waterfalls adorn the landscape of popular Mistico Park where you can inhale an aerial view of the teeming vegetation below Within the park there are horseback riding tours and night hikes where local animals like monkeys and sloths can be observed in their natural habitat beneath a blanket of stars Zip line enthusiasts should check out Arenal Mundo Aventura Toast the sunset during a scenic boat ride on Lake Arenal Looking for great views of the volcano without any walking A laid back boat ride along Lake Arenal with a local outfitter like Blue Pass could be a great way to end a long day of hiking over lava flows and sweating through your shirt Grab a cold drink and toast the sunset on a cruise or grab a kayak or paddleboard to carve your own path My favorite thing to do at VolcÃ n Arenal If thereâ s anything more relaxing than soaking in a natural hot spring with a drink in hand at a float up bar overlooking a volcano I sure havenâ t found it yet While the public hot springs are great for some fun and a good sense of the local flavor spend the extra money on the day pass at a hot spring resort like or Baldi for a more private and romantic experience If you really want to pamper yourself Arenal is also home to some of the most luxurious resorts in Central America including the notoriously FOMO inducing Nayara Springs and Nayara Tented Camp The waterfall at RÃ o Celeste Shutterstock How much money do I need for VolcÃ n Arenal This varies widely depending on your experience Budget travelers will want to gravitate more towards the local hostel or campsite Dining in one of the many local â sodaâ restaurants of La Fortuna is a great way to save money while getting to know friendly Ticos Costa Ricans On the other hand nightly stays of US or more are not uncommon at posh five star resorts Youâ ll also need a bit of cash for park entrance fees tours and transport While not â cheapâ the overall prices in the region are typically not exorbitant Cash cards and dollars are also widely accepted and tips while not mandatory are greatly appreciated Here are some estimated prices Prices are in USD National park entry fee US Hostel room US US Basic room for two US US Self catering apartment including Airbnb US per night and up Luxury resort US and up Hot springs day pass US Daily park tour pass US US Weekend of rideshare US US Dinner for two at a soda restaurant US US Dinner for two at a tourist restaurant US US Beer pint at the bar US US Do I need to book a tour Most international travelers and even some Ticos book tours with local guides for the sake of simplicity and access to local knowledge although it s not necessary if you do some basic research on Arenal beforehand If you decide to go the tour route we recommend Wayfairer Travelâ s Classic Costa Rica tour which includes a three night stay at Arenalâ s stunning Nayara Gardens Where should I stay Lodging options in Arenal are as diverse as the regionâ s ecosystem starting with the low budget but quite acceptable Arenal Backpackers Resort which also includes a nice pool Mid range rooms at typical local hotels like Arenal Observatory Lodge offer rates similar to most area Airbnbs which can be quite nice but are sometimes less reliable in quality High end resort rates can get into the thousands but may be worth it for once in a lifetime type travelers Whatâ s there to eat Costa Rican food is known for its basic healthy and affordable qualities with the food around Arenal no exception Tourist geared restaurants serving American style food are available but for a more authentic experience opt for a plate of pork or steak casado over a side of gallo pinto and an Imperial beer at a local restaurant like Soda Viquez Combine that with a late night hot spring soak and youâ ll sleep like a happy rainforest sloth
