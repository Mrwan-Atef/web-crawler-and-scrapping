Florentyna Leow Mar min read Share A tea ceremony in Kyoto B S P I Getty Images The beginnings of the Japanese tea ceremony as we know it today were developed in Kyoto sometime during the late century The English language term tea ceremony is a bit misleading and comes from Western observers perceiving the practice as ceremonial in nature in Japanese it s often referred to as sadÅ or chadÅ literally way of tea While itâ s not a ritual thereâ s plenty to enjoy and appreciate about this cultural activity such as the wabi sabi loosely translated as beauty in imperfection aesthetics of the tearoom the beauty of the utensils and the multisensory experience of tea making Many places in Kyoto from temples to teahouses offer tea ceremony experiences Some are less formal than others Some offer kimono rentals so guests can drink tea in traditional garb Some include only usucha thin green tea while others let you taste the more formal koicha thick tea as well Advertisement Perhaps one of the most common misconceptions about Japanese tea ceremonies is that they re dreadfully stiff and formal â they can be but they don t have to be A good host will always make allowances for their guests especially first timers to the tearoom As tea master Michael SÅ zui â of the Urasenke school of chadÅ â says of this activity the host makes a bowl of tea and the guest drinks the tea Everything else is detail Tea being prepared in a teahouse in Kyoto Rintaro Kanemoto for Lonely Planet When should I do tea ceremony The short answer Anytime you like The longer answer Because tea ceremony often celebrates the changing of the seasons no two gatherings will be identical and how it is conducted varies throughout the year It also depends on whether you want to attend a chakai an informal tea gathering lasting minutes to an hour or a chaji a formal tea gathering lasting up to four hours For example a summer tea ceremony is better early in the morning when it is cooler Less common but equally atmospheric is one held in the evening by candlelight During warmer weather the fire will be prepared in the corner of the tearoom further away from the guests while in winter the fire is in the center of the room Flowers are always seasonal the vase in the alcove may hold camellia flowers in spring or Chinese bellflowers in autumn Even the tea bowls used will vary depending on the time of year In other words tea ceremony is worth doing at any time of the year as thereâ s something to enjoy in every season A tea ceremony at Okitsu Club Kyoto Greg Elms Lonely Planet How much time should I spend doing tea ceremony The average group session where the host makes a bowl of tea and introduces the culture of tea ceremony to guests is usually around minutes to an hour This is generally representative of a chakai or informal tea gathering If the experience includes kimono rental or a tea sweet making session it may run up to two hours Advertisement A chaji or formal tea gathering will last around three to four hours This includes watching the host building the fire from scratch eating a multicourse tea kaiseki meal examining the tea utensils and enjoying several bowls of tea in two different styles It might seem long but time does fly by in a well executed chaji Matcha served at a teahouse in Kyoto Rintaro Kanemoto for Lonely Planet Top tea ceremony things to do in Kyoto Try tea ceremony while dressed in kimono In addition to explaining the intricacies of tea ceremony many providers offer the option to wear kimono for a more immersive experience It certainly makes you wonder how tea practitioners manage to move so gracefully on their knees while in kimono Some places that offer this option include Camellia in Ninenzaka Nagomi in Ninenzaka and Tea Ceremony KOTO near the Golden Pavilion Meet real geiko geisha over a bowl of tea If youâ re looking for a special spin on a tea ceremony experience try attending one led by a practicing geisha known as geiko in Kyoto or maiko apprentice geiko You can book a session at Maikoya where a geiko or maiko will not only demonstrate and explain a tea ceremony but also teach you how to prepare matcha offer insights into geiko culture and perform a dance This is perfect if you want to meet one of these hard working artisans while keeping interactions respectful Tea making tools at a teahouse in Kyoto Rintaro Kanemoto for Lonely Planet Meditate and make a bowl of matcha at a Zen temple Zen Buddhist monks centuries ago once used matcha as a meditation aid it helped them stay awake during long sessions so itâ s only fitting that you can combine both Shunko in offers a Zen focused version of a tea ceremony at its temple thatâ s considerably different from most others It begins with tea preparation and a seated meditation session led by the head priest followed by tea drinking more meditation a short lecture and a guided tour of the garden and prayer hall Experience a chaji or full length formal tea gathering Chaji are exceptional even in the tea world and it is rare for non tea practitioners to be invited to one Most Japanese people will never have been to one As such some tea masters have begun offering chaji experiences so that those outside the tea world can gain an insight into this special style of event No two are alike and the styles of chaji vary tremendously depending on the provider Bikouenâ s chaji is an elegant pared back affair that includes shÅ jin ryÅ ri â Buddhist vegetarian cuisine served especially at temple lodgings â while the chaji conducted by Michael SÅ zui at Kanjoan is an intimate experience tailored to each group Matcha being prepared at a tea ceremony in Kyoto Greg Elms Lonely Planet My favourite thing about tea ceremony Simply put itâ s the joy of experiencing something beautiful I adore the attention to detail in every single aspect of tea ceremony and how the entire atmosphere engages your senses It forces you to be completely present for the moment I love the mental break from technology in the tea room At the risk of sounding like a total snob I also love the tea sweets and the high quality matcha used in tea ceremony Proper matcha can be a little bitter if youâ re accustomed to matcha lattes but itâ s hard to go back to chain stores once you acquire a taste for it How much money do I need for tea ceremony and do I need to reserve Tea ceremony isnâ t cheap but it isnâ t ruinously expensive either A simple minute introduction to the practice starts at around Â US per person Expect higher prices for similar but private group sessions around Â to Â US to US or more At the upper end of the spectrum more elaborate tea ceremony experiences like chaji can cost around Â to Â to per person Most tea ceremony experiences are by advance reservation only Walk ins are rare Popular venues such as Camellia can book out several months in advance particularly during spring and autumn so itâ s best to plan early As these experiences can be reserved online payment with a credit card is usually acceptable However a small minority of providers may still ask for payment via cash or bank transfer Here are some indicative prices which represent the average cost for one participant minute tea ceremony group session Â US minute tea ceremony with kimono rental Â US Private chaji session Â US minute meditation and tea ceremony Â person US The low tables and floor cushions of a teahouse in Kyoto weniliou Shutterstock Do I have to sit on the floor While traditional etiquette encourages guests to sit on the floor seiza style with legs folded under them most providers are reasonably flexible and accommodating When making your booking ask about the possibility of using extra cushions or sitting on a low stool Alternatively Canadian tea master Randy Soen Channell conducts tea ceremonies in a more modern Ryurei style created in where guests can sit on Western style chairs instead of on tatami mats â ideal for those who find floor seating uncomfortable Tea shouldnâ t be torture so find a provider who can work with your needs Tips for first timers Wear slip on shoes as youâ ll be entering a tatami mat lined room indoors Socks are highly encouraged Wear clothes youâ ll be comfortable in while seated on the floor Itâ s best to avoid overly casual clothing such as short skirts and shorts Most tea experiences are not child friendly as they require being quiet and sitting still for extended periods of time If you re traveling with kids look for providers who offer sessions specifically tailored for families with young children Drink your matcha as soon as you receive it â donâ t wait for other guests Whisked matcha is a suspension and the powder will separate from the water if you let it sit Itâ s best when freshly whisked and still warm Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Japan Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For
