Church on Church Street in Charleston South Carolina Tetra Images Getty Thereâ s a reason Charleston SC is a consistent favorite among in the know travelers Along the coast beach communities charm visitors while the urban core features eclectic chefs who craft exquisite menus and cocktail lists A varied arts scene is evident in everything from street murals to productions at the Dock Street Theatre to the sweetgrass baskets made by members of the Gullah Geechee Nation along the â Seven Mileâ stretch No oneâ s ever left the Lowcountry dissatisfied with the food or the hospitality locals bestow upon them The combination of old Southern charm and worldly influences fuse together like a fine iced tea Advertisement Even though the downtown Charleston neighborhoods have so much to offer some of the most interesting locales extend beyond that historic peninsula The barrier islands Mount Pleasant West Ashley and North Charleston all have their own sights and tastes visitors enjoy just as much But theyâ re not all a minute car ride away from each other so itâ s easiest to concentrate on one general area in a day so you can fully soak it in â along with the sunâ s rays and high humidity The pineapple fountain at the Waterfront Park in Charleston in South Carolina USA Â Wolfgang Kaehler Avalon Universal Images Group via Getty Images South of Calhoun The picturesque tip of the peninsula encompasses Harleston Village Ansonborough the French Quarter and the famed South of Broad area Horses clip clop down the streets south of Broad as they pull carriages Rainbow Row â s Colonial Georgian architecture looms bright and large over East Bay Street Carefully preserved churches and historic homes with grand columns intricate ironwork and sideways porches dot every street

This area has some of the best places to dine al fresco The Marina Variety Store Restaurant lets you enjoy the boats in the Charleston Harbor while Vendueâ s rooftop bar and grill offers customers panoramic views of the city And donâ t miss Waterfront Park â s Pineapple Fountain where many have popped the question in the hopes of getting that Instagram worthy engagement shot North of the Crosstown Hampton Park Terrace the Northside and the Westside neighborhoods have always been more diverse less touristy and more laid back than southern Charleston Many families planted their roots here several generations ago and as a result itâ s imbued with a strong sense of community The area has less pomp and circumstance surrounding it but itâ s always been a fun place to walk around and relax Advertisement Youâ re likely to see pickup basketball games at Hampton Park directly across the street from Moeâ s Crosstown which many locals insist has the best local burger menu In fact the area is dotted with sports fields like the Charleston Riverdogsâ Minor League Baseball stadium The Citadel a military college established in lies next door with its orderly grounds and cadres of cadets The city blocks surrounding the I Highway interchange have loads of eclectic eats and watering holes The high concept Edmundâ s Oast has an ensconced outdoor bar and courtyard great for

front porch is always packed on weekends A sunrise at the Folly Beach Pier located in South Carolina Robert Loe Getty Images The Beaches The Lowcountry will teach you that not all beaches are created equal and there is a unique beach vibe for each one Folly Beach is a paradise for the perennial beach bum crowd Itâ s a great surf spot where you can see the Morris Island Lighthouse in the distance Its main drag Folly Road has all the little seafood huts tiki bars and beach shops you could ask of a six block stretch Sullivanâ s Island on the other hand draws a more serene sedate crowd There are beach rentals but on the whole Sullivanâ s has a more residential feel and a distinct air of wealth The houses lack the splashy bright colors most associate with coastal communities On the flip side this is a perfect spot for a truly relaxing beach day Fort Moultrie which began as a structure of palmetto logs and sand yet still rebuffed British ships in is a favorite of history buffs and tourists alike If you drive east on the H L Hunley Bridge youâ ll end up next door at Isle of Palms IOP IOP features seven miles of beach that you can get to via paid lots and metered spots along Ocean Boulevard This beach community has a mix of older beach cottages and tall slick structures that easily surpass the million dollar mark The Windjammer on Front Beach is a longtime favorite of barflies who appreciate stellar local music Wild Dunes located on the east end is a gated resort community with lavish homes and a top notch golf course And finally the ultra luxe Kiawah Island boasts several golf courses resorts like The Sanctuary and lots of paths ideal for a bike ride or even a leisurely stroll Beachwalker Park offers the only public access to the coastline Shem Creek marina at night Mt Pleasant SC Â PeterPhoto Getty Images Old Village This Mount Pleasant waterfront hamlet is a favorite with the and up crowd The neighborhoods are lined with leafy live oaks and white picket fences while the shopping district along Coleman Boulevard has retained its mid century charms The Hibben House holds a lot of intriguing colonial history as does the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor just up the road on Highway Shem Creekâ s dockside restaurants boast some of the best seafood in the entire Lowcountry And if you want to really enjoy the setting at sunset the Palmetto Breeze catamaran is the best and booziest if you so choose way to do it Itâ s also a stoneâ s throw away from Patriots Point a peninsula that overlooks the Charleston Harbor The decommissioned USS Yorktown is docked there and has a naval and maritime museum on board with fighter planes atop its deck If you happen to be there for Independence Day donâ t miss the spectacular fireworks show A deserted trail in West Ashley Greenway br Daniel Delgado Getty Images Avondale The Avondale community in West Ashley hugged by Highways and is perfect for a day date or a night out since it straddles the line of the commercial district and cozy neighborhood so well All the restaurants clustered around the US Magnolia Road intersection are favorites of locals and tourists alike The Roost is the kind of sports bar even a non sports fan can enjoy since it has fabulous pub fare rustic decor and a regular roster of trivia nights and live music Geneâ s Haufbrau is a solid watering hole to close out the night with its rotating beer menu and funky murals And Carolineâ s Aloha Bar is Hawaiian themed with a retro feel and an elevated bar menu It also has those tall tropical drinks that can
