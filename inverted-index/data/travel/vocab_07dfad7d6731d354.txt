questions about San Francisco Margot Seeto Sep min read Share Wondering about San Francisco Here s what our SF based travel writer is asked most often Getty Images As a travel writer whoâ s a third generation San Franciscan and moved back to the Bay Area in after a years long global stint Iâ ve seen tons of changes in the city from delightful to challenging SF debuted a gorgeous new park in the Presidio with sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge and skyline an outdoor education center exciting food trucks lots of picnic space and year round cultural festivals On the other hand conventions and retailers have pulled out of downtown due to hard economic times and a declining reputation Itâ s important to remember that every community ebbs and flows and my love for the cityâ s resilience and creativity remains strong Here are the questions I get asked the most about San Francisco Tenderloin has a reputation for open drug use but look beyond that to find a diverse neighborhood with restaurants nightlife community organizations and families Shutterstock Is San Francisco safe to visit Is the Tenderloin really that bad Yes it s safe In a nutshell â yes the city is safe and great to visit Locals are tired of hearing about San Franciscoâ s â doom loopâ narrative which promotes the idea that the economic decline of post pandemic downtown has driven businesses and residents out of the city which in turn continues to economically and culturally decimate SF all in a viciously repeating cycle Many media outlets have chosen to amplify this dramatic narrative with devastating effects like reduced tourism While there are issues with houselessness and drugs like many other cities in certain areas and some people and businesses have indeed left the city many more have stayed and even flourished and attracted newcomers Advertisement Grab a bite to eat in the Tenderloin s diverse restaurants Peopleâ s worries stem from the storied reputation of the Tenderloin and nearby parts of Mid Market and SoMa that with a high number of SROs single room occupancy and some open drug use is not for every visitor However the neighborhood is also rich with tons of diverse restaurants â including new ones from established chefs â hopping nightlife like swanky jazz clubs and cheeky dives uplifting public art museums community organizations and families Use common sense like you would in any big city and make use of a rideshare like Lyft or Uber for door to door service to minimize walking around the Tenderloin Donâ t keep valuables in cars including luggage visible in the front or back seats this advice extends beyond downtown to other tourist heavy areas such Golden Gate Park and even the posh Marina district There are still San Francisco icons in Downtown that you don t want to miss Getty Images Should I stay in Union Square or is downtown dead Downtown has a good range of places to stay While some retail giants and offices have left downtown San Francisco there is still plenty to see and do including the picture worthy cable car turnaround where passengers board and ride past distinctive Victorian houses all the way to Fishermanâ s Wharf Union Sq is still a good home base with a high concentration and variety of accommodations especially for visitors who also wish to explore Chinatown and North Beach both of which are walkable from the neighborhood There is so much art to see SFâ s arts scenes are anchored downtown because it is home to SFMOMA Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Museum of the African Diaspora and smaller galleries as well as the cityâ s symphony opera ballet and majestic old theaters like the Orpheum Curran and A C T that hosts local and touring plays and musicals and new food halls too A surprise downtown hit has been the new huge IKEA featuring a dazzling two floor food hall named Saluhall It features both Swedish classics â like those famous meatballs â and a slew of locally owned plant forward food stalls like the cityâ s only Algerian eatery Kayma and vegan Puerto Rican Casa BorinqueÃ a In the rebranded East Cut neighborhood which encompasses the SoMa area between St to near the Embarcadero the new Vacant to Vibrant Program is an innovative way to fill empty office spaces with small independent local makers on a rotating basis from food and beverage purveyors to retail and art studios The Embarcadero is a good alternative If wary about downtown but wanting to stay close to major attractions consider accommodations close to the Embarcadero Itâ s near the food and gift laden Ferry Building and thus near the ferries to Alcatraz Angel Island Sausalito and more recently to Treasure Island plus Embarcadero MUNI and BART station You can walk along the Embarcadero or take the vintage F Market Line streetcars north to Fishermanâ s Wharf and Pier possibly visiting the interactive Exploratorium museum along the way Are the famous places really worth it Yes Especially for first time visitors For first time visitors at least a quick look around the greatest hits of the city â Fisherman s Wharf Pier Alcatraz â will be worthwhile Seeing the bold orange vermilion of the Golden Gate Bridge hanging red lanterns and narrow alleyways of Chinatown and the flopping sea lions of Pier helps one to appreciate the history and diversity of the city â architecturally culturally and more See them by bus tour or MUNI Efficient ways to do see it all include the hop on hop off route on Big Bus or a full bus tour by Gray Line If leaning toward public transportation all MUNI lines run through downtown Take T Line to the new Chinatown Rose Pak Station F Market along the Waterfront Powell Mason and Powell Hyde cable car lines to Fishermanâ s Wharf and MUNI bus Line Ave to the Golden Gate Bridge Just be aware of time constraints Alcatraz is almost always crowded including the long line to queue for ferry boarding The Golden Gate Bridge is at the very north end of the city making transportation time to and from there a bit time consuming And don t miss the restaurants Just east of Fishermanâ s Wharf the longstanding Ghirardelli Sq where the Ghirardelli Chocolate Experience itself got a revamp in from the same design firm behind the Apple stores has also become home to a surprising number of independent restaurants that both locals and tourists love From an outpost of Detroit style pizza purveyor Square Pie Guys to James Beard Award semi finalist Filipino fine dining restaurant AbacÃ the areaâ s restaurant renaissance may be worth a sampling tour Advertisement Museums like SFMOMA have free and reduced admission days Bumble Dee Shutterstock What budget do I need to visit San Francisco With the increased cost of food labor and more costs of living in already expensive San Francisco have gone up You can either lean into the lifestyle or enjoy the city for cheap Local transport is reasonably priced Public transportation remains affordable with single MUNI rides at flat with a Clipper card and BART rides within the city are A rideshare across the city will run about depending on time of day There are places to stay for all budgets The lowest cost accommodations aside from using sites like Couchers or Trustroots are shared hostel rooms that begin at at places like Hostelling International Some boutique hotels and well known mid range chains run about per night and up Higher end hotels can cost per night and more Accommodations from sites like Airbnb and VRBO have a similar price range but greater choice in geography Plan your food and drink spend with this guide to prices For food breakfast can range from a massive grilled breakfast burrito from Il Canto Cafe in FiDi to a filling fried catfish eggs Benedict from either of the Brendaâ s locations The cheapest coffee would be drips from no frills donut shops like Allstar Cafe to for specialty lattes from third wave coffee shops like Blue Bottle For lunch grab a super fresh Vietnamese banh mi sandwich from Saigon Sandwich in the Tenderloin or have a whole Dungeness crab paired with a high quality congee at Harborview on the Embarcadero During happy hour itâ s still possible to grab pints of beer across the city but cocktails are commonplace as well Dinner can range from for a plate of house noodles from the cash only Chinese Burmese Yamo in the Mission to for prix fixe fine dining tasting menus like at the modern American Lazy Bear or Japanese omakase at the new shiny location of old favorite Akikos Cover for live music at bars usually runs though many remain free Look for free days at museums Admission to museums and other attractions ranges from but there are free or reduced admission days throughout the year for many like at SFMOMA and Asian Art Museum What should I eat and drink SF is still a hotbed of new restaurants and beloved pop ups anchoring themselves in brick and mortars The number of new restaurants opening in San Francisco returned to pre pandemic levels back in including downtown and in robust numbers across residential neighborhoods like the Richmond and Portola districts There are new and noteworthy openings The west sideâ s quaint West Portal neighborhood has seen newsworthy openings lately from Italian American takeout joint and pantry Little Original Joeâ s to the same local familyâ s ambiance filled Elenaâ s to new Italian wine bar Binu Bonu arriving with a sterling reputation as sister establishment to Sicilian restaurant La Ciccia in Noe Valley which features exquisite small plates It s still possible to get a meal for or less In terms of budget options the cash only Saigon Sandwich in the Tenderloinâ s Little Saigon remains one of the best and most affordable sandwich shops in the city with deliciously fresh bÃ nh mÃ from to Breakfast sandwiches have been getting the royal treatment lately but with many still remaining less than like the popular Breakfast Little Sandwich for Lots of pizza by the hands of high end chefs make slices from to like at the Tenderloinâ s Outta Sight Pizza or Divisaderoâ s Sunset Squares Takeout dim sum and dumpling spots that are plentiful in Chinatown Portola the Sunset and Richmond districts are another way to experience SF famous rice rolls and more on a budget And who could forget the cityâ s robust mostly affordable Mexican and greater Central and Latin American food scene extending beyond the well known Mission style burritos at El Farolito to El Salvadoran pupusas at La Santaneca to beefy lomo saltado at Mi Lindo PerÃº Fine dining in San Francisco is affordable Affordable fine dining is also a real thing with Michelin level tasting menus doable at around give or take Enjoy a prix fixe seasonal menu at North Beachâ s Trestle or three to five courses for at the French Asian Cassava two to four course Malaysian meals for to at the Tenderloinâ s Azalinaâ s or a course menu at the newly Michelin starred local ingredient driven Adams Sitting at the bar and ordering off the bar menu is another way to experience fine food for less and doesnâ t require reservations Visit the Mission for shops nightlife and people watching in Dolores Park Shutterstock Is the Mission still cool What other neighborhoods are worth visiting The Mission is still cool The Mission is still indeed a great place to visit whether for daytime shopping at indie shops on Valencia like the odd Paxton Gate or people watching at the sunny Dolores Park Nightlife is still hopping in the neighborhood both along Mission and Valencia and many pockets in between from the rollicking dive Kilowatt to the consistently creative cocktail bar Trick Dog Explore these surrounding neighborhoods too But if you want to explore around a little check out Bernal Heights It is south of the Mission still actually on Mission Street and has its own laid back bars many featuring live music like the Royal Cuckoo Organ Lounge and the Knockout Hayes Valley is also a convenient commute just east of Civic Center and the walkable neighborhood has no shortage of restaurants such as a Mano for fresh pasta and award winning cocktails at the ship themed Smugglerâ s Cove The residential west side neighborhoods are full of worthy and affordable mom and pop restaurants like Yuanbao Jiaozi and the Burmese Mandalay but also chill bars like at the Irish Mileâ pubs along Clement St including the Plough and Stars great for live music and the Bitter End In the north end of the city the Marina and Cow Hollow attract the younger bourgeois set with plenty of bars and restaurants Taste bloody Marys at the longtime Balboa Cafe or ibÃ rico ham xiao long bao on the huge patio of Blue Whale Howâ s the LGBTIQ scene these days While SF has long been a center of queer culture it continues to make history such as with activist Honey Mahogany being appointed the director of SFâ s Office of Transgender Initiatives and her helping to create SFâ s official Transgender District in part of the Tenderloin near the cityâ s original queer hub of Polk Gulch The Castro is still out and proud The Castro is still considered the center of SFâ s contemporary queer scene being the home of the GLBT Historical Society Museum and the historic two story corner bar Twin Peaks Tavern â possibly the first gay bar in the US to have floor to ceiling windows symbolizing being out and proud The annual Pride month in June has gained a reputation for parties and a huge parade that are both community building and wildly fun and there s more in SoMa Part of SoMa has also been named the Leather and LGBTQ Cultural District celebrating the recent reopening of the Stud which considers itself the cityâ s oldest queer bar At what types of places should I make a reservation Even at fully booked restaurants solo travelers and small parties can often walk in for bar seating Many restaurants also reserve some tables for walk ins so the best bet is to arrive early ideally waiting outside before a restaurant opens Or go late However certain establishments only accept reservations often released a month or more in advance like Noodle in a Haystack which serves rare types of ramen and other high quality Japanese food Sign up to receive Open Tableâ s Notify Me alerts for specific restaurants â you ll be notified of last minute cancellations Attractions like museums usually have tickets available at the door unless a popular exhibit requires timed entry like the recent traveling installation of Yayoi Kusamaâ s infinity rooms at SFMOMA What are some good day trips from San Francisco There is so much to do in the city but for a change of pace consider taking a day trip from SF Excursions include those as close as the relaxing coastal towns minutesâ drive south the vibrant East Bay minutes away and redwood trees and wine country in the North Bay minutes north and beyond Aside from conventional car rental companies consider car shares such as Getaround Zip or GIG which usually have cars available for pick up in multiple neighborhoods Where should we take the kids With so many museums green spaces and attention to accessibility much of the city is friendly toward little ones and wheeled things like strollers except for maybe the hills Narrow down your family hit list with our guide to what to do in San Francisco with kids Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For
