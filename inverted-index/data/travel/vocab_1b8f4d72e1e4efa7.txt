Shopping Nightlife Performing Arts Arts ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD To the urban and hip Adams Morgan is like a beacon in an otherwise stuffy landscape D C may have a reputation for being staid and traditional but drab suits classical tastes and bland food make no appearance here Adams Morgan takes its name from two elementary schools that came together in after desegregation It remains an ethnically diverse neighborhood with a blend of cuisines offbeat shops and funky bars and clubs Adams Morgan and its neighboring Columbia Heights comprise the city s Latin Quarter The area wakes up as the sun goes down and young Washingtonians in their weekend best congregate along the sidewalks crowding the doors of this week s hot bar or nightclub Typical tourist attractions are sparse but the scene on a Saturday night has its own appeal If you re here on the second Saturday in September sample the vibrant neighborhood culture at the Adams Morgan Day Festival which happens to be D C s largest neighborhood festival Recommended Fodor s Video Elsewhere in Washington D C Downtown Restaurants Things to do Hotels U Street Corridor and Shaw Restaurants Things to do Hotels Capitol Hill and
