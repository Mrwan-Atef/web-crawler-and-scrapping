Lastoe Apr min read Share Welcome to the Johnson s in Lower East Side Manhattan Cole Wilson for Lonely Planet Sticky floors ice cold beers on draft gently priced shot and drink combos and a total lack of pretension are a few trademarks of a dive bar Their grungy bathrooms graffitied and laden with random stickers â beer is good â â patriarchy is deadâ are often devoid of mirrors The bartender might know your name â and definitely your drink order â if youâ re a regular Throughout the years many of New York City â s dives have closed their doors victims of gentrification and an industry catering to a crowd all too eager to pay big bucks for cocktails made with herbal infusions eye droppers of artisanal bitters and clear as glass ice cubes And itâ s true that these cocktail bars rooftop bars natural wine bars and craft breweries have a place in the Big Appleâ s bar scene but to those who love a good dive â and honestly who doesnâ t at least on occasion â nothing beats knocking back a shot of Jameson on a backless bar stool in a grungy space thatâ s not trying to do anything except exist as a space where people can get their drink on without blowing their paycheck Advertisement â Longevity is one of the key ingredients of a dive bar â says Seth Gerber a food and beverage expert and part time faculty member at Boston University Itâ s not really up to the barâ s owners and operators to decide if their establishment is a dive explains Gerber adding â You can strive to be one but itâ s ultimately an honor that gets bestowed upon you â While there are many amazing dive bars in New York City this is our strongly opinionated list of the cityâ s very best Left Facade of Canal Bar in Gowanus Brooklyn Cole Wilson for Lonely Planet Right Behind the bar at Canal Bar Cole Wilson for Lonely Planet Canal Bar in Brooklyn Located on an increasingly busy stretch of Ave in Brooklyn â s Gowanus neighborhood Canal Bar is on the grungy side as all great dives really ought to be and super welcoming in spite of it It helps that the bar is dog friendly making it a real neighborhood bar where regulars sip cold pints of beer with a book Although the draft beer selection is pretty solid the bartenders here donâ t mess around when it comes to the classics either If youâ re a Manhattan lover you wonâ t be disappointed Make it happen Happy hour drink specials run Monday to Friday from to After work on weekdays is a good time to visit when the bar is particularly pleasant Jeans and old concert Ts or flannels will have you feeling right at home Turkey s Nest Tavern in Williamsburg Brooklyn Cole Wilson for Lonely Planet Turkey s Nest Tavern in Williamsburg Generally speaking Williamsburg where this old tavern resides might indeed be overrun with hipster bars and speakeasy spots but donâ t sleep on Turkeyâ s Nest a sports dive on Bedford Ave thatâ s been around since the â long before Williamsburg was where the cool kids hung out Floors can get sticky but the big game whatever it happens to be that day is always on and the atmosphere is convivial Itâ s a great spot on a pub crawl through Brooklynâ s Northside Make it happen While you wait for your brunch table stop in for a cold beer or Bloody Mary Bring cash as the bar doesnâ t accept credit cards and note that drinks are on the strong side so pace yourself Left Bartender at Ryan s Daughter Cole Wilson for Lonely Planet Right Ryan s Daughter in the Upper East Side Cole Wilson for Lonely Planet Ryan s Daughter on the Upper East Side This Upper East Side bar has been serving the neighborhood for more than years Ryan s Daughter prides itself on offering affordable drinks often a dollar or even two below what you might find on Fifth Ave The tavern doesnâ t do a happy hour per se but drink and shot specials are a regular occurrence In the tradition of an old time tavern Ryanâ s Daughterâ s beer menu includes a house brew â the Ryan s Daughter Ale â thatâ s provided by one of the barâ s suppliers Advertisement Make it happen Ryan s Daughter makes a great stop if youâ re museum hopping on the Upper East Side Stop in during the week before and see what drinks the bar has discounted that day The tavernâ s take on a shepherdâ s pie particularly well received on a cold day Clockwise from top left Welcome to the Johnson s in Lower East Side Pool cues Hanging out A PBR and a shot Cole Wilson for Lonely Planet Welcome to the Johnsons on the Lower East Side The Lower East Side isnâ t exactly lacking in the dive bar arena but some dives are better than others and Welcome to the Johnsons is one of the cityâ s very best Itâ s dark and dingy loud and a little smelly but itâ s a great late night stop if youâ re on a bar crawl or if youâ re just looking for a place with cheap drinks a pool table and an easy vibe Make it happen Cheap PBRs are the drink of choice so avoid ordering any fancy cocktails â this just isnâ t the place for that Dress down or risk looking out of place in the bar that sort of reminds you of your high school friendâ s basement McSorley s Old Ale House in the East Village Manhattan Cole Wilson for Lonely Planet McSorley s Old Ale House in the East Village This bar dates all the way back to the century â to be exact â and women have only been permitted to patronize the saloon since McSorley s is truly a no frills bar with a choice of light or dark ale and a handful of basic food items like a fish and chips plate or a ham and cheese sandwich You come here to say youâ ve been where the likes of John Lennon and Abe Lincoln sipped suds and maybe to make a new friend or two Make it happen Itâ s cash only so come prepared Unless you like waiting a long time for your ale avoid the bar on St Patrickâ s Day when itâ s filled to the gills Note that it can be thick with tourists but thatâ s part of the fun Left Hot dogs at Rudy s Bar Grill in Upper East Side Manhattan Cole Wilson for Lonely Planet Right Rudy s Bar Grill Cole Wilson for Lonely Planet Rudy s Bar Grill in Hell s Kitchen It would be an egregious error not to include this dive of all dives on a best of New York City dive bar list Rudyâ s open since with the original wood door still intact is Hellâ s Kitchenâ s historic bar dishing up free hot dogs with any purchase Itâ s a place for tourists and locals alike both groups sidling happily up to the original mahogany bar custom made for the space The beer remains dirt cheap and the party goes until every night Make it happen Rudyâ s opens at Monday to Saturday TVs broadcast sporting events and the long time friendly bartenders add to any visit The available merch makes a great souvenir â the hot dog sticker for is a no brainer The Gate in Park Slope Brooklyn Cole Wilson for Lonely Planet The Gate in Park Slope This beloved Park Slope institution has been around since The Gate was serving craft beer before craft beer was a thing and thus considers itself Brooklynâ s oldest craft beer bar In addition to craft brews you can order a Guinness or choose from a handful of enticing nonalcoholic options including the Phony Negroni which even the non sober curious seem to love Make it happen The outdoor seating fills up fast on clement weather days so arrive when the bar opens if you want to snag a seat The bar is dog friendly but only well mannered canines please Also worth mentioning this is family friendly Park Slope so strollers are very possible Bar in Lower East Side Manhattan Cole Wilson for Lonely Planet Bar on the Lower East Side You can come here to try the original pickle martini a fusion of cucumber and vodka created by Charles Hanson who bought the bar in or you can come to soak up the historic vibes and kitschy decor of the year old bar while sipping a PBR Bar has a pool table in the back no nonsense bartenders and energetic music that keep this dive bar spinning into the wee hours of the morning Make it happen Happy hour specials run from to daily but go on a weekend for DJ enhanced fun This bar does accept credit cards but there is a minimum so bring cash if you re only planning on popping in for one Clockwise from top left Skylark in Park Slope Brooklyn Pinball machines Beers on tap Board games Cole Wilson for Lonely Planet Skylark Bar in South Slope A High Life and any well shot is called the Easy Rider Thelma Louise is a Narragansett and shot of Old Overholt rye whiskey Located in the South Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn Skylark has only been around since but it has the feel of a well worn establishment perhaps owing to its aesthetic While there is a full drink menu the only food for purchase are chips and salsa or chips and shelf stable nacho cheese but youâ re not here to eat â not with those pinball machines in the back Make it happen This isnâ t a late night bar last call is at Food delivery is permitted so order your favorite carryout when you get the munchies Botanica Bar in Nolita This unassuming Nolita watering hole on Houston St in Lower Manhattan is reached by descending down a short flight of steps Like many a dive the interior of Botanica Bar is dark and moody and itâ s enhanced by a DJ spinning tunes on weekends If youâ re lucky enough to get there before all the cool thrift store furniture is spoken for settle in and wait to see if the night will turn into a karaoke fest Make it happen The crowds can be pretty thick by or so plan your visit accordingly Happy hour goes until You ll see a lot of distressed denim sweaters and beanies in the winter Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere
