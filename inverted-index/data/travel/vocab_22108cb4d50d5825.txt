On a hilltop backed by powerful mountains stand the sombre and mighty ruins of Ancient Mycenae home of Agamemnon the legendary king who commanded the Greeks during the Trojan War For four centuries in the second millennium BC this kingdom was the most powerful in Greece holding sway over the whole region and influencing other Mycenaean cities History The World Heritage listed Mycenae is synonymous with the names Homer and Schliemann In the century BC Homer told in his epic poems Iliad and Odyssey of well built Mycenae rich in gold These poems were until the century regarded as no more than gripping and beautiful legends But in the the amateur archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann despite derision from professionals struck gold first at Troy then at Mycenae This link between the mythical and factual runs thick through Mycenae s history According to Homer the city was founded by Perseus the son of Danae a princess and Zeus a god and by King Agamemnon s time the Royal House of Atreus which ruled Mycenae was the most powerful of the Achaeans Homer s name for the Greeks Whether Agamemnon and his family ever existed is uncertain However the archaeological facts are that Mycenae was first settled in the Neolithic period and came to prominence in the late Bronze Age from about BC In the wake of the Indo European wave that arrived in Greece between and BC and influenced by the already present Minoan and Cycladic civilisations an advanced culture developed on the mainland This new civilisation is now referred to as the Mycenaean named after its most powerful kingdom The other kingdoms included Pylos Tiryns Corinth and Argos all in the Peloponnese Evidence of Mycenaean civilisation has also been found at Thiva Thebes and Athens A photo of Mycenae archaeological place at Greece RODKARV Shutterstock The city of Mycenae consisted of a fortified citadel and surrounding settlement at its height from to BC Due to the sheer size of the Cyclopean walls high and thick formed by stone blocks weighing tonnes in places legend has it that Perseus enlisted the help of a Cyclops one of the one eyed giants described in the Odyssey to build Mycenae Archaeological evidence indicates that the palaces of the Mycenaean kingdoms declined sometime around BC and the palace itself was destroyed around BC possibly by fire Whether the destruction was the work of outsiders or due to internal division between the various Mycenaean kingdoms remains unresolved Through the entrance gate it s worth stopping by the Ancient Mycenae Museum entrance included in the general ticket price for additional context Touring Ancient Mycenae Lion Gate Agamemnon s fortress is entered through the dramatic Lion Gate a solid construction of massive stone blocks over which rear two large lions This motif is believed to have been the insignia of the Royal House of Atreus Grave Circle A Once inside the citadel Grave Circle A is on the right This was the royal cemetery and contained six grave shafts Five shafts were excavated by Schliemann between and uncovering one of the richest archaeological hauls ever to be found including a well preserved gold death mask Schliemann sent a telegram to the Greek king stating I have gazed upon the face of Agamemnon though the mask is thought to have belonged to a ruler who lived centuries before the era when the Trojan War might have taken place Agamemnon s Palace Follow the main path up to Agamemnon s Palace accessed through what was once a monumental doorway The rooms on the north side of the palace were likely private royal apartments where Agamemnon was supposedly murdered On the palace s southeastern side is the megaron reception hall where the great hearth would have been with the column bases remaining Beyond this are buildings that probably served as artisans workshops The valley views from the top of the hill here are phenomenal Secret cistern Head down to the northeast extension and you ll find the entrance to the secret cistern in the corner This marvellous vaulted tunnel a masterpiece of engineering at the time descends via dark steps half heartedly roped off to a spring Follow the main path anticlockwise and on the northern boundary of the citadel you ll come across the Postern Gate through which it is said Orestes escaped after murdering his mother Clytemnestra Tombs Until the late century BC the Mycenaeans interred their royal dead in shaft graves later they used a new form of burial the beehive shaped tholos tomb Back outside the Lion Gate head down to the tholos tombs of Aegisthus with its collapsed
