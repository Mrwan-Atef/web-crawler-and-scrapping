sunsets Rosie Bell Jun min read Share Although Panama City sits along the water there are no swimmable beaches within city limits But no need to worry There are plenty of beautiful beaches to choose from that are just a short drive away Â Sam Edwards Getty Images Sandy adventures in the slithering bicoastal isthmus of Panama often begin in its skyscraper filled capital Panama City The majestic towers along the water give the impression that this metropolis is a beach city but it actually sits along a bay and there are no swimmable beaches within city limits Just minutes away by car however there are countless scenic spots to splash around and lay footprints in the sand Advertisement Sip a cocktail with friends at LOST Urban Beach Club Â DisobeyArt Shutterstock Sip a sundown cocktail at LOST Urban Beach Club The beach at LOST Urban Beach Club is not a natural wonder but it is a destination you donâ t want to miss This manmade sandy spot is situated at the sail shaped JW Marriott Panama the most iconic building in Panama Cityâ s skyline Days spent here are for sipping palette pleasing cocktails and feasting on sushi as you take refuge from the bustle of the city in the Punta Pacifica neighborhood Sunbathe on Playa El Tuco Casco Viejo The last real beach within Panama City Playa El Tuco is a tiny stretch tucked away in the old town of Casco Viejo Youâ ll find it behind the Arco Chato ruins at the end of Calle Oeste Veering into these waters isnâ t recommended due to sanitation concerns but itâ s a great place to lay down a towel sunbathe and enjoy some sweet solitude Thereâ s a high chance youâ ll have this recreational zone to yourself â itâ s rather underutilized even by Panama City residents Top things to do in Panama City For a quick escape from the city try Veracruz Beach Veracruz Beach wonâ t win any beauty pageant awards but it does the trick when youâ re in urgent need of salty water About a half hour drive by car Veracruz is the closest beach to Panama City What it lacks in looks it makes up for with beach bars and restaurants offering day to night fun and fantastic seafood Pay a visit to Praia Fish Drinks to take a photo on the water swings and to mingle with a cosmopolitan crowd on weekends Head to Cornado for beautiful black beaches and enjoy beach volleyball or paddleboarding Â Marek Poplawski Shutterstock Bask in the black sand at Coronado Palm fringed Coronado is about an hour from Panama City depending on traffic and itâ s located in Panamaâ s Dry Arch Arco Seco which receives the lowest annual rainfall in the country A wild beauty with black and white sand sun seekers will enjoy playing beach volleyball renting paddleboards or touring the laid back expansive beach on horseback Advertisement Top things to do in Casco Viejo Surf the waves at El Palmar El Palmar is one of the best beaches around Panama City Just minutes from the capital in the district of San Carlos the living is easy and the surf is great on this pleasing swathe of sand Surf schools abound to help novices find their feet in the water and experienced surfers will enjoy the waves here too Those that prefer to stay dry can visit the nearby town of San Carlos which is just a minute walk from the beach Kitesurfing is a way to spend a day at Punta Chame Â Getty Images Kitesurf on Punta Chame Around minutes from the capital by car Punta Chame is a slender peninsula that pokes out into the Pacific Ocean The strong winds and the rock and obstacle free waters make it hugely popular for kitesurfers Head to Panama Kite Center to get suited and booted for your aquatic adventures You can secure accommodations in Punta Chame options include studios and glamping tents and book excursions to nearby Isla Taborcillo a deserted island once owned by actor John Wayne How to spend the perfect weekend in Panama City For an easy island getaway head to Taboga Island If you donâ t have access to a car or prefer not to drive to your tropical haven nearby Taboga Island is your best bet The â Island of Flowers as Taboga is affectionately called is a mere minute ferry ride away and itâ s the quickest â and most picturesque â escape to paradise from the capital The journey there starts on Panama Cityâ s charming Amador Causeway which is home to the worldâ s first biodiversity museum and four manmade islands called Culebra Perico Naos and Flamenco Head to the latter to board the Taboga Express fast ferry and youâ ll be sipping piÃ a coladas beachside in no time Once on Taboga relax on Playa Restinga the most popular beach or hike through sweet smelling bougainvillea and rolling hills â Cerro Vigia and Cerro de la Cruz are the highest points â to uncover sweeping views of Panama City If possible avoid the urban escapee crowds by visiting Taboga on a weekday Clear waters and white sand make San Blas a great spot for snorkeling Â Shahaira Getty Images Snorkel the day away at San Blas The beaches of the San Blas Islands are otherworldly spotless and staggering Some of Panamaâ s most postcard worthy isles are situated in this strong archipelago on Panamaâ s Caribbean coast You can traipse along ghost white sand peer under clear waters teeming with fluorescent tropical fish island hop to find snorkel worthy sunken ships and meet the local Guna population that inhabits this protected paradise Purchase colorful traditional Mola fabrics and dine on the catch of the day with your island hosts under a thatched roof San Blas is a three hour ride to the port of CartÃ from Panama City an impossible drive without a Many visitors hire cars for the winding journey but package tours including transportation are recommended over self guided visits At CartÃ boats wait to transport travelers to the island s of their daydreams Even just a day trip to San Blas is well worth the journey but staying overnight is certainly advisable for next level stargazing under palm trees Do all the things at Bocas del Toro If you fly from Panama City to the Archipelago de Bocas del Toro within an hour youâ ll be on incredible beaches with enchanting names like Wizard Beach Red Frog Beach and Starfish Beach â one of the most famous and best swimming beaches in Panama In Bocas â as locals refer to it â there are nine islands to suit every desire and intensity of activity You can spot pods of dolphins during day trips to the sandal shaped Zapatilla Cays hang loose with bats at the Nividia cave on Isla Bastimentos take in a glorious sunset beside manta rays at a beachside bar on Isla Carenero or catch a wave at a world renowned surf beach such as Playa Bluff on Isla Colon Best of all travelers can live a charmed existence as they re ferried between these islands on delightful water taxis called lanchas Advertisement
