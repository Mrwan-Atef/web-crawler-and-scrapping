What and where to eat in Ticino Switzerland TRAVEL A culinary tour of Ticino the Swiss canton with Italian influences The Swiss canton on the Italian border blends Mediterranean and mountain cuisine with charcuterie honey sweet panettone and floral wines served against a towering Alpine backdrop Positioned upon the shores of Lake Maggiore much of the architecture within the town of Ascona is of a Mediterranean style Photograph by Ascona Locarno Tourism By Oliver Smith September This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Switzerland s Gotthard Base Tunnel is the longest and deepest railway tunnel in the world Trains burrow for miles beneath snow capped Alpine peaks plunging to depths known mostly to miners and single celled organisms Board a train to journey through it and you can bear witness to this feat of engineering and with a window seat you also see how this tunnel divides two different worlds North of the Gotthard you re in Switzerland among meadows where cowbells clang and kitchens serve stew and strudel When the train re emerges into sunshine south of the tunnel palms begin to displace conifers trackside and the hiss of espresso machines can be heard in station cafes And when the balmy breath of the distant Mediterranean drifts in through an open carriage window you understand that in traversing the tunnel you ve made the journey from Northern to Southern Europe Specifically you ve arrived in Ticino the Italian speaking canton of Switzerland that in many ways resembles Italy Here Vespas stop for you at zebra crossings and statues of William Tell cohabit with those of Dante Alighieri in the elegant town squares And although food is treated with the same reverence as in that peninsula to the south it s tempered by Swiss precision There s certainly much to look forward to when locals glance at their expensive watches and realise it is lunchtime It s noon when I disembark the train in Ticino s biggest town Lugano perched where green foothills meet the vast blue lake of the same name I m met by guide Anna Bezzola and taken to a local deli Gabbani for my initiation into the rites of Ticinese cuisine Sausages the size of artillery pieces dangle from the ceiling Jars of porcini are stacked in pyramids Fruit panettone hint at the influence of Milan which is just over an hour away by rail In Ludiano Grotto Milani serves a local speciality of pumpkin soup at its traditional Ticinese grotto restaurant Photograph by Giglio Pasqua Switzerland Tourism Formaggio d alpe ticinese is a semi hard cheese produced in the mountains of Ticino Photograph by Daniele Maini Wandering around Gabbani the aromas of Ticino s prize produce hits the nostrils the semi hard Alpine cheeses that are often produced in remote mountain farmhouses using recipes guarded by jealous custodians and the high ranges that enclose them Gabbani s Alpine cheeses are like ancient stones their exteriors coarse and craggy until the slice of a knife discloses their young buttery core We try a few including sweet piora and the slightly nuttier alpe manegorio Anna explains that the pastures the cheeses are named after shape their flavours cows on south facing meadows graze on different flora to those on north facing ones Environment is everything she explains Sometimes you can almost taste the barn Beneath the pastures lies the literal and metaphorical bedrock of Ticinese cuisine The next day we drive north into the valley of Vallemaggia Here Ticino s topography is steep and high snowy mountaintops mingle with passing clouds waterfalls slip through chestnut forests to a valley floor pungent with wild garlic All around is the detritus of rockfalls dispatched from the summits and hidden beneath them Ticino s famed grottoes Put simply a Ticinese grotto is a natural subterranean space dedicated to storing produce meats cheeses and wines a relic of an age before electric refrigerators You see them across Ticino from the outside they can resemble hobbit houses with their tiny doors and bits of brickwork They stay warm in winter and cool in summer and it s often summer when their padlocks are unlocked and their contents uncorked or unpacked to be shared at granite tables outside in the sunshine The grotto is where people congregate explains Anna as we explore a complex of them in the village of Cevio It s where cuisine connects to geology Inside their crypt like spaces is a deep damp silence that whispers of cheeses and wines growing venerable In more recent times the concept of the grotto has evolved some serve charcuterie to passersby others offer hot food In a wider sense the word grotto has been applied to any restaurant serving hearty mountain dishes and wine in tiny china mugs emblazoned with the flag of Ticino At a grotto you find a Mediterranean spirit of epicureanism But there s also a pragmatism characteristic of mountain folk stashing their bounty through the seasons patiently waiting until the day the little door creaks open again Near the Swiss village of Camedo the Centovalli train crosses the Melezza barrier lake towards the Italian border Photograph by Christof Sonderegger An hour south in the village of Arogno near Lugano s south shores Gabriele Bianchi has a technique for avoiding bee stings You have to pretend to be an astronaut he says moving through a swarm with deliberate zero gravity movements You should go slowly and don t be afraid they can sense fear on you Gabriele is harvesting some of the first honey of the season at his farm in the hillside village With a nervously outstretched finger I scoop some from his hive it tastes richly floral with the tang of false acacia whose nectar the bees have plundered of late Soon Gabriele says the honey will have a flavour of chestnut as those trees in turn begin to flower Beehives are characteristic of Ticino and a mainstay of Gabriele s organic farm Azienda Agricola Bianchi Just years old the farm takes inspiration from a more distant era when self sufficient smallholdings rather than corporate monocultures defined the Swiss hills The principle Gabriele insists is that everything works together his wildflower meadows support the bees a flock of geese munch bothersome weeds while herbs thrive in the shade beneath vines In ages past such an approach was necessary for farmers inhabiting heights far beyond the reach of tarmac roads Today the emphasis is on sustainability Sitting under a pergola in late afternoon sunshine we savour some of Gabriele s wines made with johanniter and solaris grapes common varieties in Switzerland This being Ticino we toast in French German and Italian before sipping and savouring the view Above us bursts of cultivated edelweiss beside us young olive trees imported from Lake Como s shores They re ambassadors from separate ecological worlds and the farm is poised to make the most of both It s about picking the fruits of the land says Gabriele And doing it with knowledge inherited through generations Only a few generations ago Ticino s uplands were much busier Throughout the and centuries mountain communities emptied out as people sought new lives in France or the US sooner than suffer another hard winter of Swiss snowdrifts Not so long ago there were residents in the highland hamlet of Vergeletto Today that figure is closer to one of whom took it upon himself to revive an ancient culinary tradition and thus revive the fortunes of the village Ilario Garbani restored Vergeletto s watermill in order to produce farina bóna a sweet flavoured flour once widely eaten across Ticino Photograph by Ilario Garbani Balancing a straw hat on his head Ilario Garbani shimmies down a timber beam to open a sluice gate With a creak his restored watermill chunters slowly into life Outside a mountain stream crashes about the paddles while inside a millstone whirrs casting off a fine powder This so called good flour farina bóna made from roasted corn was once eaten widely across Ticino but later partly displaced by more versatile maize and all but forgotten in the after the last miller passed away Ilario a former teacher interviewed elderly residents about their memories of the mill and rebuilt its mechanisms from scratch His sweet flavoured flour has found its way into everything from craft beer to ice cream and pasta dishes in its smoky notes you can almost taste ancient winters by the fireside in a mountain hut It s coveted by local restaurants and visitors make their way to Vergeletto to seek it out It s about food Ilario tells me But it s also about the past experiencing the same flavours as our forebears There s something hypnotic in watching the flurries of farina bóna floating from the millstone like parmesan being grated over pasta or snowfall on a Swiss mountaintop Soon after a bag of farina bóna drifts into the Gotthard Tunnel stashed in my luggage on a northbound train along with Alpine cheese and a bottle of Ticinese wine Where
