well Photograph by Phil Schermeister Nat Geo Image Collection By Austyn Gaffney April min read Like many places Mammoth Cave Kentucky s only national park and the world s longest cave system saw its visitation hit hard by the COVID pandemic In more than half a million tourists descended on the acre park but that number fell by half in to just Coronavirus precautions were partly responsible The park limited its typical roster of almost cave tours to a single self guided tour and provided timed tickets to groups of no more than people As current federal mandates require all visitors and employees are masked within federal buildings and the cave system But this year the continued search for outdoor activities may bring greater popularity to Mammoth Cave National Park at least according to AirBnB which listed the area in its top trending destinations in March Molly Schroer spokesperson for Mammoth Cave says one of the main draws for visitors is the diversity of park experiences plus miles of aboveground trails and riverways for hiking biking horseback riding and paddling as well as plus miles of limestone labyrinths underground This image made around shows people

first discovered Mammoth Cave more than years ago The ancestors of seven tribes associated with historic use of the parklands including the Cherokee Nation and Shawnee Tribe once used the cave system to mine minerals like gypsum with mussel shell scrapers harvested from the Green River They told their own stories in petroglyphs pictographs and burials leaving behind mummified remains These cave discoveries suggest people may have lived in America twice as long as we thought Settlers began to explore the caves in the late century Many discoveries were shaped by Black explorers some were enslaved in the saltpeter mines to produce black gunpowder and others as maids and cooks in nearby hotels The legendary Stephen Bishop arrived at Mammoth Cave as a teenager in and quickly became one of the park s most popular geologists and guides One visitor said Bishop was almost as widely known as the cave itself Like a bygone era s Indiana Jones Bishop discovered new subterranean portals including Mammoth Dome and the Ruins of Karnak by crossing obstacles like the Bottomless Pit Bishop was enslaved all the while only gaining his freedom just prior to the Civil War Although he chose to stay and work as a paid guide Bishop once called the cave system he loved a grand gloomy and peculiar place Mammoth Cave is Kentucky s only national park But the importance of Black guides who worked for a century alongside white cave guides was diminished when the National Park Service began operating Mammoth Cave in The federal government chose not to hire any of the park s Black guides including those serving for a fourth generation Some of these guides were the descendants of Materson Bransford a son of his own enslaver who was leased to the owner of Mammoth Cave in his early twenties Materson s great great grandson Jerry Bransford continued his legacy in when he was hired to work at Mammoth Cave half a century after his last relative left park employment The Cave Wars In

number of tourists to southcentral Kentucky farmers and landowners jumped on potential profits descending into legal fights over property rights to caves hundreds of feet below the surface But in the
