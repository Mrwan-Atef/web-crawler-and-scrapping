dropped two atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan surrendered soon after and World War II was over within a month Never before had such a devastating weapon been unleashed A decade later the Peace Memorial Park and Museum opened in what was once Hiroshima s busiest commercial and residential districts and tourism has steadily increased since Dark tourism travel to sights of disaster violence or war draws inquisitive crowds to Hiroshima annually Nearly two million people visited in and the city only expects that number to grow in Commemorating the Past Hiroshima

blast for the striking of a peace bell The same evening people light candles in a Toro Nagashi ceremony roughly translated to the Flow of the Lanterns Colorful glowing paper illuminates the same waters the injured and dying waded through for relief Each symbolizes a soul lost on that day and more than are lit every year Monuments throughout the city pay tribute to life lost in the blast and afterward There are statues for the Korean nationals killed and a Children s Peace Monument that honors Sadako Sasaki a young survivor who later died of leukemia There is even a little known plaque
