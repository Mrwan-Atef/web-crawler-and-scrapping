of many adventures travelers find in northern Italy Photograph by MARKUS GREBER SKYSHOT By Stephanie Pearson January min read If your trip style leans more to the rugged and remote well traveled Italy might not be your first choice But the Dolomites region in the country s north surprises with an adrenalized beauty even the most adventurous travelers crave Here s an action packed itinerary for the region reported by a seasoned adventure traveler that takes in the towering Dolomites the hills of Valdobbiadene artful Venice and windy Lake Garda This tour will have you hiking biking and sailing all while sampling prosecco and meeting some of northern Italy s most dedicated craftspeople Mountain climbing in the Dolomites The base of Tofane mountain is surrounded by red rock vertical faces with dozens of climbing routes Ten miles east down Falzarego Pass is the village of Cortina d Ampezzo In the chic alpine resort hosted the Winter Olympics which brought the Dolomites to the attention of the world s glitterati from Frank Sinatra to Brigitte Bardot In June the International Olympic Committee awarded the Winter Games to Milan Cortina The mile Alta Via is among the most popular hiking trails in the Dolomites The stretch around the Passo Falzarego nearly feet in elevation is a thrilling walking path Photograph by Patitucci Photo My focus is on climbing a thousand feet straight up on Ra Bujela a via ferrata that starts near the top of the women s World Cup downhill run at Cortina Via ferratas or iron paths are climbing routes that World War I soldiers built by pounding iron runged stairs into the rock in order to climb otherwise impassable peaks The historical routes are so popular with recreational climbers that ski resorts and mountaineering associations across the Dolomites continue to build new ones such as the route we re about to climb Related See stunning photos of hikers on via ferratas in the Dolomites I m with Carlo Cosi a professional mountaineering guide originally from Padua He s climbed all over the world earning a nomination for the Piolets d Or mountaineering s highest honor for a route he opened in Peru But it s the Dolomites that Cosi loves best My group of three is roped together as an extra safety measure in addition to being connected individually via two carabiners that fasten our harnesses to the cable route We climb the first pitch straight up a vertical wall to a narrow footbridge suspended between two pinnacles The reliable footholds and ever present cable give rusty climbers like me an opportunity to once again feel the exhilaration of summiting otherwise unreachable heights The nice thing about the Dolomites Cosi says is that they are for everybody Where to stay Cristallo Resort Spa a five star property in Cortina d Ampezzo built in with views of the Tofane mountain range Where to eat El Brite de Larieto a quaint rifugio shelter in the middle of a cow pasture in Cortina d Ampezzo serving classic northern Italian

Italy after World War I Here percent of the residents speak German percent speak Italian and less than percent speak Ladin a language from a culture that has existed in these valleys in South Tyrol for years Matthias Thaler our mountain biking guide and a former ski racer for the Italian national team is one of Ladin people who remain here To cover more ground I have rented an e mountain bike to pedal up to the Pralongià Plateau a wide open space that sits at almost feet and serves as a natural viewing platform to foot Marmolada Glacier the highest peak in the Dolomites Sella Ronda a legendary ski touring circuit and Sasso di Santa Croce a massif on which Reinhold Messner opened a famous climbing route in Just below the plateau sits Piz Arlara a rifugio with a deck facing the Sella Ronda We take a long lunch here drinking lemony radlers similar to shandies and soaking in the view before riding the flow trail down to the base of the mountain Before we leave I ask Thaler if the crosses at nearly every summit are World War I memorials No he responds they re a sign that we re closer to God The steep hills of Farra di Soligo at about the halfway point along the Prosecco Road have long grown grapes that go into producing Italy s most popular wine Photograph by COLIN DUTTON South Tyrol may be closer to heaven but the residents still love their Italian wines The Costa

features a bottle wine cellar that specializes in biodynamic small batch varietals Sixty percent are from Italy During the wine tasting in the hotel s cellar restaurant I m not surprised to find that my favorite is a Barolo produced in Piedmont With smoky notes reminiscent of coffee and leather the varietal is the king of Italian wines according to Jan Clemens whose family owns the hotel This he adds is the elegant part of Italy Where to stay Hotel Ciasa Salares in San Cassiano a third generation family owned hotel with an outdoor garden and mini zipline Hotel La Perla in Corvara a

Bronca estate I m sipping tastes refreshingly crisp It s made by Antonella and Ersiliana Bronca two sisters who took over their father s winery in The women and their families grow their grapes on a patchwork of acres scattered throughout the region of Valdobbiadene This along with the neighboring region of Conegliano became Italy s UNESCO World Heritage site on July thanks in part to its aesthetically pleasing checkerboard landscape I am joined by Giovanni Zanon who owns Villa Abbazia an century palace converted to a five star hotel in the village of Follina Villa Abbazia also houses the only Michelin starred restaurant in the region Last night its Puglian chef Donato Episcopo prepared us an elaborate whimsical five course meal that included trout marinated with citrus fruits for the entrée and ended with tiramisu the same recipe Zanon s family has used since and too much grappa This morning Zanon s cycling fanatic side has taken over and he s riding with me on a route of his design that climbs feet through jasmine scented hills The terrain is exhilarating with punchy climbs long leisurely downhills and minimal traffic We stop every few miles to eat and drink with Zanon s friends At Pasticceria Villa dei Cedri I try the traditional southern Italian cream puff tette delle monache The name I later learn translates to nuns breasts Despite this reminder that Italy is slightly behind the curve in MeToo political correctness it s a luscious treat that pairs well with espresso It fuels me for our final climb to the new tasting room at Garbara winery in Cartizze

gondola secrets in Venice Saverio Pastor is one of five remèri or oar craftsmen left in Venice The walls of his shop Le Fórcole are lined with wooden oars he s made and the floor space is filled with oarlocks or fórcole that look like sculptures The Bridge of Sighs which spans a canal from the marble clad Doge s Palace proves that the beauty of Venice quickens the pulse as much as any outdoor excursion Photograph by COLIN DUTTON SIME The stop at Pastor s shop is just one of many on a walking tour I ve arranged with Luca Zaggia a marine scientist in an effort to further understand Venetians intricate relationship with water Zaggia in turn invites Giovanni Caniato a scholar and expert on Venice s boating history Coastal morphology is the main issue in Venice especially the impact of large boats Zaggia tells me as we walk cobblestoned streets infamously sagging under the effects of overtourism An estimated million plus tourists visit annually while the resident population of shrinks by the year I wrongly assume that the monster cruise ship I saw being tugged through the canal yesterday is the worst offender but Zaggia corrects me Cruise ships often create less damage than cargo ships he says He adds that while cruise ships are far from ideal vessels for Venice one of the best ways for tourists to mitigate further damage is to avoid taking private high speed water taxis Their waves cause more erosion than slower moving ferries On the western shore of Lake Garda the town of Salò was originally founded by the Romans Photographs by Simon Bray Lake Garda Italy s largest Lake stretches miles long and miles wide Photographs by Simon Bray At Squero San Travaso an out of the way century boatyard owner Lorenzo Della Toffola is building a wooden gondola spine under the bright sun It will take him hours to complete one boat Brian notices the stern ferro the high point at the back of the boat is hinged Gondolas have big problems Caniato says explaining that because of rising water levels the boats no longer fit under the bridges during high water peaks and have to be modified Our final stop is a century boatyard that houses the private association Arzaná Inside are ancient rudders and oars the largest collection of fórcole in the world and one of the association s period boats Caniato pours us a glass of red wine and we make a toast to his beautiful city which has survived centuries Despite its woes he says I would never leave Venice Where to stay Hotel Casa Verardo a three star hotel in a century palace located down a quiet alley in Venice Where to eat

Mincio River Photograph by Simon Bray Sailing in Lake Garda Thanks to George Clooney and his passion for Lake Como Lake Garda to the southeast is largely overlooked by Americans The northern third of square mile Lake Garda is off limits to private powerboats which makes it a mecca for windsurfers kitesurfers and sailors because the winds whip up like clockwork and hold steady for hours A Flying Phantom catches wind on Lake Garda one of the world s best regatta locations with international competitions held throughout the year Visitors can pick up skills at lakeside sailing schools Photograph by Martina T B Created for Team Masterlan Lake Garda s two main winds are the Pelér and the Ora The Pelér a northerly morning wind blows off the mountains and is known as the good weather wind creating sets of small waves that are ideal for beginning windsurfers and kitesurfers It normally dies down before noon just as the Ora comes from the south generally blowing to knots the perfect wind for experts Sure enough this morning the lake was glassy enough to paddle stand up boards to the other side but it s p m and the winds have picked up It s time to go fast on the catamaran My sailing instructor Ivan Pastor of Sailing Du Lac the lakeside windsurfing and sailing school at the Hotel Du Lac et Du Parc mans the rudder We sail until we reach a part of the lake farther south devoid of ripping windsurfers and single masted Optimists Then he hands the rudder and sheets to me I used to sail catamarans as a kid but it s been a long long time The most important thing with sailing is learning how to read the wind Pastor tells me It s good advice but I m in the weeds trying to wrap my brain around the counterintuitive way I have to push the rudder away from me while simultaneously uncleating the sheet as I m going about Eventually my sailor s muscle memory returns enough for me to steer the boat downwind We start to heel laughing out loud and clipping along at a pace that feels dangerously close to flying Where to stay Hotel Du Lac et Du Parc Grand Resort a property with sprawling gardens near palm tree lined Riva del Garda Where to find guides Segnana Watersports offering
