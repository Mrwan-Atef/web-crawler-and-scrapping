Dara Apr min read Share With Bermudaâ s crystal clear waters you donâ t have to get out of the boat to see marine life Â Raul Rosa Of course youâ re going to Bermuda for the beaches But thereâ s much more to do on this tiny island in the Atlantic Ocean than plonk yourself on the sand While Bermuda is not part of the Caribbean it shares the same history of colonial influences pirate outlaws and

history here are nine things to do to break up those beach days on Bermuda Advertisement The towns and villages dotted around Bermuda s shores are well worth exploring Â Cavan Images Getty Images

and you ll find them at most island pubs and hotel bars Seek out rum based cocktails near Castle Harbour at the historic Swizzle Inn named after the house punch For cocktails with a view try the beachside bars at coves such as Tobacco Bay and Achilles Bay or waterfront restaurants such as the Birdcage and Eat a fish sandwich While you may have tasted a fish sandwich before it wasnâ t a Bermuda fish sandwich On this idyllic island fresh catch of the day usually a white flaky fish like snapper wahoo or mahi mahi is fried and stacked between slices of raisin bread slathered with tartar sauce and hot sauce Locals know to ask for the sandwich with â the worksâ â usually lettuce tomato and onion plus extra tartar sauce on the side The combination may sound a bit much but you wonâ t

Enjoy Bermuda s calm waters on a boat trip around the island Â Gla Flamme Getty Images iStockphoto View the island from on deck Cruising away from the jagged coast on a boat trip will let you take in Bermudaâ s size and topography from a new angle and the view from the water is the same view that once greeted pirates smugglers and the Royal Navy sailors who pursued them both Advertisement Whether itâ s a summertime â raft upâ regatta with locals â lubricated with plenty of homemade rum swizzles â or an off season cruise enjoying the moderate winter temperatures boating is never a bad idea
