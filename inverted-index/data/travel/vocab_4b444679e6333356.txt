must try outdoors adventures on mainland Greece TRAVEL must try outdoors adventures on mainland Greece Plot an active break whether you want to climb up a mountain rife with myths or swim down to a lost city The submerged lost city of Pavlopetri lies off the Peloponnese coast Photograph by PitK Alamy By Kerry Walker April This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK One of the best ways to explore mainland Greece is under your own steam through the myriad activities on offer here There are opportunities to don a mask and flippers and snorkel over an ancient submerged city to climb Mount Olympus the fabled home of Zeus king of the gods to leap into a boat and whitewater raft down a mile long gorge and to ski through the quiet backcountry of its Peloponnese mountain range Kayak on Lake Kremasta Created during a hydroelectric project to dam four rivers Greece s biggest artificial lake is a fjord like island speckled beauty that twists and turns over miles While you can admire the alpine loveliness of the Agrafa Mountains from its pine fringed shores there s nothing like kayaking in quiet exhilaration across its glass calm cerulean blue waters in summer pausing every so often for a refreshing dip Choose a quiet time of day such as early morning or evening and keep your eyes peeled for wildlife including golden eagles otters and wolves Finix Adventures runs three hour guided kayaking tours on the lake year round Climb Mount Olympus Ruled by Zeus Greece s highest mountain is a living legend The topmost of its peaks is cloud wreathed Mytikas a holy grail to hikers Scaling its gnarly heights is a two day challenge you ll hike up to seven hours a day on exposed terrain with rocky scrambles and steep slopes to negotiate It s best to join a guided walk such as those arranged by Trekking Hellas Helmets harnesses and ropes are provided for the final climb where you ll be rewarded with views over peaks and valleys to the Aegean A night at a mountain refuge on the Muses Plateau is special too as you ll awake to a fiery sunrise befitting the gods The Menalon Trail through the Arcadia mountains passes cliff hidden monasteries Photograph by Getty Images Hiking the Menalon Trail Imagine the burbling streams glassy rivers moss cloaked forests and towering peaks that poet Virgil so eloquently captured years ago when evoking the idyll of Arcadia in Eclogue then lace up your boots for this five day hike through the Central Peloponnese Carving an enchanting path through the real life Arcadia the Menalon Trail is a glimpse of pre dawn of tourism Greece Leading from Stemnitsa to Lagkadia the well signposted mile eight stage trail tiptoes through wild and remote landscapes taking in silent pine woods wooden bridges and old mule paths from stone built village to stone built village You re bound to be smitten by the deep sheer walled Lousios Gorge where nymphs bathed an infant Zeus in the fast flowing river and by fresco adorned Prodromos Monastery which clings to a cliff It s best to hike the trail from April to November staying overnight in family run guesthouses Snorkel in Pavlopetri Pop on a snorkel ordinarily and you might expect to see fish or perhaps the odd wreck but Pavlopetri off the coast of southern Laconia in the Peloponnese is unique Twelve feet down these crystal clear waters hide a real life Atlantis a sunken Minoan city years old yet still extraordinarily intact Flipper past Bronze Age streets mansions courtyards and rock carved tombs No experience is needed simply follow the underwater signs detailing three swimming routes and providing background on the ruins Epos Travel organises tours to the area or grab a snorkel and go it alone Ski in Kalavryta Picture Greece and you re likely thinking sun kissed islands not snowy ski slopes But the country has the latter too The mythical home of the Muses Mount Parnassos near Athens gets all the fuss for its downhill but for quieter days and tons of fresh downy powder make for the mountain resort of Kalavryta in the northern Peloponnese where the slopes spread between and high From December to April the real joy here is skiing into the crowd free backcountry with phenomenal views of the Gulf of Corinth It s wise to hook up with a guide such as Orias s experts to explore the undiscovered slopes of the Helmos mountain range The Vikos Gorge in the namesake national park is perfect for a picturesque white water rafting adventure on gentle rapids Photograph by studiodr Getty Images White water rafting in Vikos Gorge Who needs the Grand Canyon for drama Mother nature pulled out just as many stops to create the Vikos Gorge in Greece s mountain rippled Vikos Ao√∂s National Park One of the world s deepest gorges the long deep ravine is spectacular enough from the hiking trails threading deep into it especially in the rose gold glow of sunrise or sunset But it s even more so when you take a white water raft along the river s glassy green waters and gentle rapids shaded by centuries old plane trees Trekking Hellas organises three hour excursions for beginners Bring swimming togs and a towel Mountain biking in Zagori Snowcapped during the cooler months the thickly forested canyon riven Pindus Mountains rise sheer and rugged above the wilds of Epirus in northwestern Greece This is a terrific region to jump into a bike saddle for a two wheel go slow adventure Perhaps the prettiest stretch of all is Zagori where you can tick off traditional grey stone built slate roofed villages like rosary beads Here the largely car free routes send you rattling over old stone paths and humpback bridges to historic chapels and monasteries mountainside and riverbank villages and wineries Zagori Outdoor Activities
