to watching the sunset in Wadi Rum a road trip in Jordan is full of adventure Â IulianUrsachi Getty Images Exploring Jordan on a road trip affords you access to places unreachable by public transportation giving you the freedom to choose your own adventure along the way rather than being tied to the timeline of a set tour But driving in Jordan also often means interpreting unwritten rules of the road while navigating congested streets And for those who would rather leave the driving to someone else there are plenty of other ways to get around Jordan too from bus rides to hiring a driver Here are five of our favorite road trips in Jordan including one day two day and day routes Weâ ve also included a variety of activities to bring you closer to this countryâ s land people and culture Because most visitors to Jordan fly into Amman weâ ve included road trips that start in the capital and nearby Madaba Advertisement You can start your road trip in Amman Jordan s capital and one of the oldest cities in the world Â Shutterstock Jordanâ s northern route Best road trip for history and culture Ammanâ Amman miles allow two days This two day road trip starts atop Citadel Hill in the heart of Jordanâ s capital Amman is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world excavations at the Citadel have unearthed artifacts from as far back as the Bronze Age and you can still see evidence of the Umayyad Roman and Byzantine periods â along with sweeping city views â from this hilltop vista Leave Amman behind and head for the rolling hills of northern Jordan stopping by Ajloun Castle for panoramic views of the countryside Sit down to a home cooked meal at a local restaurant in Orjan before heading to Umm Qais Spend the afternoon touring the Greco Roman ruins of Gadara and when youâ re ready for a break grab a seat on the outdoor patio of Umm Qais Resthouse located on a hill within the archeological site If you time it right you can catch the shifting sunset colors over the Golan Heights and the Sea of Galilee On day two try an immersive activity with Baraka Destinations such as beekeeping foraging cycling basket weaving or hiking in Yarmouk Forest Reserve or another nearby trail â then refuel at Galsoumâ s Kitchen the home of a local chef in Umm Qais The second part of the day is dedicated to Jerash home to one of the best preserved Roman cities in the world and the halfway point on your drive back to Amman Planning tip Signage is limited at Jerash so itâ s best experienced with a guide who can provide cultural and historical context while leading you around the extraordinary ruins Float in the waters of the Dead Sea and enjoy a spa treatment nearby Â Pavel Savchuk Shutterstock Driving to the Dead Sea Best one day road trip from Amman Ammanâ Dead Sea miles allow hours Advertisement This road trip from Amman offers desert views along a stretch of the scenic Kingâ s Highway and a nice reward at the end a therapeutic session at the Dead Sea Detour to Madaba to check out Byzantine era mosaics that show the oldest known map of Palestine on the floor in St Georgeâ s Church Be sure to make the drive up Mt Nebo â where itâ s believed Moses saw the Promised Land before he died â for a view of the Jordan River Valley Dead Sea and beyond On a clear day you may spot Jericho and Jerusalem in the distance You can also see remnants of preserved mosaics in the presbytery at the summit Continue on to the Dead Sea where a handful of hotels await offering a range of spa treatments as well as access for overnight and day pass guests to mineral rich mud and salty water Jordanâ s Mt Nebo is where Moses is said to have seen the Promised Land Â Julie Mayfeng Shutterstock Madaba to Dana Drive on the Kingâ s Highway Best road trip for castles canyons and culture Madabaâ Dana miles allow one day Although the Kingâ s Highway Highway has been an important trading route for millennia it isnâ t necessarily the quickest But thatâ s also what makes it special Drivers looking for a direct route to southern Jordan tend to take the Dead Sea Highway Highway or the Desert Highway Highway But those looking for a scenic drive choose the Kingâ s Highway The view of the Dead Sea from Mukawir Castle known variously as Machaerus Qalaâ at Al Meshneq and the Castle of Herod the Great alone makes it worth the detour from the Kingâ s Highway and because youâ ll be off the beaten path you might have the site to yourself Stop by the Bani Hamida Weaving Project to purchase some handmade souvenirs or book a workshop in advance and learn to make your own Add a splash of adrenaline on a guided canyoning tour at Wadi Mujib before making your way back toward the Kingâ s Highway and a visit to the highly explorable Karak one of the Levantâ s largest crusader castles Plan to reach the village of Dana before sunset Sipping shai tea while looking out over the Dana Biosphere Reserve is the perfect way to end the day Drive past rust colored dunes in Wadi Rum on an off road adventure Â Herre van der Wal Lonely Planet Into the sands of Wadi Rum Best for an off road adventure Wadi Rum Villageâ desert camp miles allow two days Travelers with experience off roading can give true desert driving a try with this Desert Eyes self drive excursion Follow the Bedouin guideâ s lead as you travel from Wadi Rum village along rust colored desert tracks and dunes to a remote campsite stopping along the way to appreciate the natural rock bridges jagged cliffs and lunar like landscapes of this breathtaking place Spend the night sharing stories and a Bedouin barbecue around the campfire before falling asleep under the stars Whether you want a half day jaunt or a multiday adventure this trip is customizable Distance stops and duration can be determined when booking depending on your interests Planning tip Youâ ll need a vehicle and appropriate off roading insurance for this experience If you prefer the passenger seat book a guided Wadi Rum tour All of Jordan from north to south The best ultimate day road trip Umm Qaisâ Aqaba miles allow days If you have days in Jordan this route offers the ultimate road trip itinerary for experiencing the countryâ s highlights from north to south Itâ s also a great way to get the most out of the Jordan Pass Spend the first two days hiking forested trails wandering the Roman ruins and engaging with locals through immersive activities in Umm Qais and Jerash Afterward give yourself at least hours in Amman to check out the ancient sites and array of artisan shops and art galleries while tasting your way around the city Marvel at the preserved mosaics in Madaba or book a workshop and make your own en route to the Dead Sea Stay overnight so that you can soak in the mineral dense water indulge in a spa treatment and rest up before heading to southern Jordan Take the Kingâ s Highway to Karak Castle and enjoy the dusty desert scene on your way to Dana Spend the night here to fully experience its slower pace unique ecosystem rugged terrain and Bedouin hospitality Book a guided hike in the Dana Biosphere Reserve the largest nature reserve in the country and one of the best places to hike in Jordan If youâ re planning to stay at Feynan Ecolodge you can still make a side trip to Karak when traveling from the Dead Sea though given the lodgeâ s location youâ ll continue on to Feynan on Route rather than the Kingâ s Highway Give yourself a full day for trekking the trails and visiting the stone carved tombs of UNESCO listed Petra before continuing on to Wadi Rum where you can hike the dunes and overnight in Bedouin camps Cap your day Jordan journey off with some underwater adventures in the seaside city of Aqaba Before you hit the roadâ Here are a few things to keep in mind before embarking on a road trip in Jordan Drive during the day Since some roads donâ t have street lights it s safer to avoid nighttime driving altogether Use GPS Some parts of Jordan have limited signage and roads sometimes have multiple names or none at all You might not always have a cell signal so be sure the map app you use will work if your phone is offline Fuel up Although Jordan is a small country there are stretches of road outside the major cities without many gas stations Donâ t forget to travel with food and water Desert conditions can be extreme and if you do have any car troubles you donâ t want to be stranded without supplies Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Jordan Let a local expert
