published by the Institute for Crime Justice Policy Research Thailand has the world s second highest incarceration rate of women Andrea Giorgetta the Asia Desk Director at the International Federation for Human Rights FIDH says Women in Thailand tend to encounter greater difficulties and discrimination than men within the legal system due to a combination of factors including poverty a lack of legal knowledge and inadequate legal assistance These social and economic factors result in women receiving longer sentences that are disproportionate to their offenses especially when you consider women s caregiving obligations or the role of abuse and coercion After serving their time in prison women may face difficulties when it comes to finding jobs which is why reoffending rates for women are between percent who are detained a second time and percent who are detained up to a fifth time Related Some of the best cheese in the world is in Thailand here s where to try it Massage centers
