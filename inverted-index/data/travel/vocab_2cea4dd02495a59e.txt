Bangkok s excellent street food and markets are a great way to eat well on a budget Â Witthaya Prasongsin Getty Images Bangkok has an enduring allure to global visitors that never seems to get old or go out of style â it continues to fight for its spot on lists of the world s most visited cities From hallowed monasteries to all night techno clubs street noodles to Michelin starred tasting menus and lush public parks to gritty urban train loops Thailand s capital will leave you dizzy with options and a never ending list of reasons to return Advertisement That admirable versatility creates an extreme range of costs reflecting differing income levels and social strata amongst both locals and international visitors The City of Angels can be a gift to budget travelers if you know where to cut corners but costs can quickly spiral if you go off script Here are all the insider tips you need to ensure your trip to Bangkok doesn t break the bank Daily Costs in Bangkok Hostel dorm bed Basic room for two Self catering apartment including Airbnb MRT subway ticket City bus Canal boat Motorcycle taxi Car taxi Coffee Local Thai dinner of four dishes for two Bottle of domestic beer in a shop Bottle of domestic imported beer at a bar or restaurant Glass of wine in a bar or restaurant Average daily cost Avoid big crowds and high prices by visiting Bangkok during low season Â boonchai wedmakawand Getty Images Time your visit well For maximum savings avoid travel during peak season if at all possible High season in Bangkok extends from mid November to early March when hotels hostels and guesthouses enjoy high occupancy and charge full rates It gets even more expensive the week before Christmas through the week after New Year s â some accommodation providers add temporary surcharges of to percent to their peak season rates Room rates tend to run significantly lower at other times of the year with the best deals typically offered in June July September and October Find out more about big events in Bangkok and what you can expect each season in our insider guide to the best times to visit Choose local budget airlines Two airlines based in Thailand â Nok Air and Thai AirAsia â almost always offer lower domestic fares than those posted by national carrier Thai Airways and boutique marketed Bangkok Airways It also pays to travel lightly â eligible carry ons can be taken aboard for free while checked luggage costs and up for Thai AirAsia or kg Nok Air If you can t resist traveling without your home comforts book your checked baggage in advance to save cash Start planning early to nab the cheapest fares and choose off season bargains to save big and stretch your budget Opt for a cold beer over cocktails Wine and spirits whether imported or produced in Thailand are subject to high taxes â as much as for imported wine Just one bottle of wine can double or triple your restaurant tab â a night out in Bangkok that focuses on cocktails and cabernet can often cost the same as one in a European or US city Beer which is subject to a much lower tax rate will bring your restaurant and bar bills down to more affordable levels Advertisement Domestic beers such as Singha Chang and Leo cost about less than imported beers International brands that are brewed in Thailand under license such as Heineken San Miguel and Tiger are priced in between domestic and imported beers Thai craft beers including such well known brands as Chalawan Chatri and Busaba arenâ t actually brewed in Thailand but in neighboring countries Cambodia and Vietnam as well as in Australia they tend to be priced similarly to imported beers Bangkok s street food scene allows you to eat incredible food on a budget Â Brostock Getty Images Eat like a local The dining scene in Bangkok has exploded over the last decade Enterprising chefs from all over the world along with practically every global culinary franchise have moved in with a vengeance At last count the city boasted Michelin starred chefs elevating Bangkok to world class levels for fine dining Although these tasty delights are wonderful for a big occasional blowout they re not a nightly option for those visiting on a budget Luckily Bangkok is known for its incredible street food culture and the streets are where you ll find the best bargains Itâ s also where youâ ll find the most authentically Thai and Thai Chinese cuisine arguably representing the real heart and soul of the city Bangkok street food includes not only umbrella shaded carts parked at the edge of the road or on footpaths but also one room eateries in modest shophouses throughout the city You ll find the pick of such culinary gems in Talat Noi Chinatown Suan Phlu Phra Nakhon and Banglamphu and also in lesser numbers sprinkled about every precinct of the city Multiple course family style meals are very affordable for tighter budgets stick to one plate dishes where rice is included in the order Embrace public transport Taxi fares are relatively low compared to many other major global cities but they can still eat up your daily budget quickly The BTS Skytrain and MRT subway lines are much better budget options than taxis and you won t waste time sitting in traffic jams The networks are quite extensive and you can reach just about any corner of the city using one or the other Travel cards are available for both modes of transport but there are no discounts available and youâ ll have to pay a deposit for the card For short visits itâ s better to buy separate tickets at the station MRT offers a discount for seniors over years of age for all fares and you donâ t have to be a Thai citizen to take advantage of the discount â just show your passport at the ticket window A discount is also available on MRT for children who are under tall and aged under BTS doesnâ t offer senior or child fares for foreigners City bus fares are even cheaper than rail or subway fares but the huge network with over separate routes is complicated and the buses tend to be slow and relatively uncomfortable Canal boat lines are similarly cheap but much easier to figure out Boats run frequently in daylight hours along Khlong Saen Saep across the city from west to east and theyâ re especially useful for passengers visiting attractions along the lengthy Sukhumvit Road Hop on a motorcycle taxi from the canal jetties to get there quickly The Chao Phraya River Express line operates passenger boats up and down the Chao Phraya River stopping at piers on both sides along the way for fares of between to There s also a Chao Phraya Tourist Boat hop on hop off service that departs every minutes from piers between Sathorn Pier and Phra Arthit Pier A ticket costs and includes unlimited stops along the route for one day running from Sathorn to Phra Arthit between and and from Phra Arthit to Sathorn between and Stay in a neighborhood away from the tourist crowds to save money Â boonchai wedmakawand Getty Images Stay outside the tourist hub Generally speaking restaurants and accommodations along or near Sukhumvit Rd from Soi and as far east as Soi tend to be more expensive than elsewhere in the city The concentration of bars nightclubs restaurants speakeasies and massage shops in this district is significantly higher here than in any other area in Bangkok but you ll pay for the privilege Go beyond the tourist hub to find bargains in Talat Noi Chinatown and Phra Nakhon sometimes referred to as Old Town three contiguous neighborhoods extending from Charoen Krung Rd parallel to the Chao Phraya River and then north to the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew Amidst the most historic buildings and temples in the city there are dozens of budget hostels and guesthouses along with small eateries and street vendors offering some of the best and most authentic Thai and Chinese cooking in the city All for less than half the price you d pay around Sukhumvit Rd The districts around Sathon and Silom Rds are a little more expensive than their Old Town neighbors but tend to be more colorful culturally engaging and affordable than the Sukhumvit area Towards the north end of the city the Ari neighborhood is similarly mid level when it comes to budget but has a more authentic Thai community vibe Save on sightseeing with a GetYourGuide City Card GetYourGuide City Cards offer an all inclusive pass good for attractions for two to five days starting from The card includes walking and bike tours river cruises cooking classes massages pub crawls and a few museum entries but not temple entry fees Make a shortlist of your must visit highlights to ensure you get maximum bang for your baht before booking Why not start with our favorite things to do in Bangkok Advertisement
