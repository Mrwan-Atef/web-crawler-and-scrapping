Oct min read Share Taiwan is a breeze to visit but it doesnâ t hurt to know a few things before you go Â Getty Images iStockphoto Taiwan is a breeze to visit with easy to navigate transport systems handy convenience stores at every turn and endless restaurants that just hit the spot That said it doesnâ t hurt to prepare a little before you go Here are some tips from a Taipei resident of seven years Book accommodation early Taiwanâ s sweeping range of lodgings means you can live like a multimillionaire or a monk although it s at the midrange hostels and B Bs that youâ ll get the best deals Advertisement Rooms sell like hot dumplings during summer Lunar New Year and national holidays Book at least two months ahead In Kenting Jiufen and Alishan spots favored by local vacationers and glampers early reservation is key Aside from pitching a tent the cheapest sleeps are at temples with guest rooms To hike Taiwanâ s highest mountains youâ ll need a permit or two and the process can take weeks If you want to stay in the cabins youâ ll need to apply for those as well The process may not be a walk in the park but Taiwanâ s breathtaking high mountains will reward you generously Reservations are strongly advised for weekend dining in Taiwan Â Getty Images iStockphoto Make restaurant reservations Eating will be an important part of your trip and reservations are strongly advised for weekend dining A few days will do for most restaurants though Michelin starred tables such as RAW and Le Palais need to be reserved a month or two in advance Book by phone or on Facebook A growing number of places will also let you reserve with Google For walk in only hotspots get there early or get ready to see Taiwanâ s famous queue culture in action Dinner service usually begins at and starts winding down in less than three hours This means your restaurant options grow thin after â but then street food filled night markets are always an option Tap and go with EasyCard or iPass EasyCard is Taiwanâ s contactless smartcard that you can use on the metro local buses and trains except high speed rail as well as convenience stores and supermarkets Youâ ll also need it and a local phone number for Youbike Taiwanâ s electronic bike sharing service The card itself costs NT and you can top up at any metro station or convenience store Any unused money is refundable so donâ t lose your card iPass is Kaohsiung â s version of Easycard which is issued by Taipei The two are interchangeable Download those transportation apps The governmentâ s bilingual apps are wonderful for checking routes fares arrival and departure times and even whether or not you can bring your cello on board You can purchase digital train tickets via T Express for high speed rail and å é µeè é for railway or simply use the apps for information and buy tickets at the station counters Taiwanâ s metro systems are straightforward but apps like Taipei s å å æ é Go can help you make better decisions about whether to get the day pass or whether you should just bus it Taiwanâ s bus apps give similar information to Google Maps but with more accurate arrival times At Taiwan s convenience stores you can buy prepaid phone cards train and concert tickets snacks and more Â Getty Images iStockphoto Convenience stores are little shops of wonder Taiwanâ s convenience stores let you buy prepaid phone cards print and photocopy buy train and concert tickets send and pick up local packages and use the ATMs You can do most of this on an automated kiosk while basking in the aroma of tea infused eggs roasted sweet potatoes or whatever decent tasting rice or pasta dish a fellow customer happens to be reheating for indoor seated enjoyment Bear in mind not all kiosks have full English translations so ask a staff member for help if you need it Many convenience stores have toilets open to the public too Advertisement Pack enough prescription meds for your trip If youâ re on a specific antidepressant drug blood pressure medication or contraceptive pill bring enough with you to be safe If you need flu and cold medicine head over to Watsonâ s or Cosmed for Tylenol or its local equivalents Sanitary products can be easily purchased from supermarkets and drugstores Some cafes and restaurants even provide them for free in the womenâ s toilets The Be considerate on public transport The metro and buses have priority seating that s a different color from the other seats Most Taiwanese who are not elderly pregnant or physically challenged would never think of sitting there but in recent years detractors have been questioning whether age and appearance are accurate reflections of need arguing that itâ s fine for anyone to use the seats until someone needier comes along Whatever you choose to do it helps to be aware of these dynamics Taiwanese metro commuters take the no eating and drinking rule very seriously Chewing gum and sips of water are frowned upon Carriages are also quiet Your chances of overhearing someoneâ s life story are disappointingly low Tipping is not customary but it is appreciated You are not expected to tip at restaurants whether or not they levy a to service charge many do Taxi drivers donâ t expect tips but you may hear a brighter xie xie thank you if you round up to the next dollar It is courteous to give the porter at better hotels NT If youâ re happy with a massage or a tour guide add to the bill Your attire should cover the thighs shoulders and midriff when visiting a temple Â Getty Images iStockphoto Wear whatever you like but dress respectfully at temples While middle aged Taiwanese tend to dress conservatively young urbanites in Taipei and Kaohsiung are sartorially quite open minded That said clothes that show more skin such as crop tops or halternecks are much less commonly worn than in London or New York for example and may get some stares Itâ s a different story when you visit a temple â here wearing clothes that cover the thighs shoulders and midriff is regarded as a sign of respect Take off your shoes when entering homes Taiwanese do not wear outdoor shoes inside their homes If your host offers you a pair of slippers accept or propose going with socks It is not customary to remove shoes before entering a temple especially in urban temples though the rule may be enforced in a particular hall housing a sacred relic or a fragile heritage building You can get by without much Chinese Most Taiwanese in the major cities know at least some English Naturally the further you go from the metropolitan areas the less prevalent the language is But with the friendliness and hospitality of the Taiwanese and some help from good old Google Translate you can get pretty far Bring your reusable water bottle Taiwanâ s tap water is officially deemed safe to drink however itâ s hard to know for sure if the pipes in a particular building are up to par Using your own drinking water bottle is by far the cheapest greenest and safest way to hydrate There are water fountains in all metro and train stations public facilities such as information centers libraries and museums and even temples When checking in at your lodging ask reception where the water dispenser is Taiwan is affected by frequent natural disasters This includes earthquakes typhoons floods and landslides Avoid mountainous areas after quakes and heavy rains Strong winds often mess up sailing schedules to and from Taiwanâ s islands and cross island buses may stop running after a landslide Check with the relevant authorities before heading to the station or pier with your umbrella Be wary of where you smoke Smoking is banned in all indoor public places such as hotels restaurants shopping malls and metro stations and this is strictly enforced Smoking at alfresco cafes is common Taiwan is great for solo women travelers Taiwan has a very low crime rate and many solo women travelers report feeling safer here than in other destinations Some train and metro stations have nocturnal women only wait zones that you can take advantage of especially if traveling alone at night Taiwan is a welcoming place for LGBTIQ travelers The first country in Asia to legalize same sex marriage Taiwan is friendly and progressive especially Taipei home of the Chinese speaking world s most vibrant Pride parade Kaohsiung which has its own Pride comes a close second In terms of nightlife however Taipei wins hands down Useful resources include Utopia Taiwan Tongzhi LGBTQ Hotline Association and Taiwan LGBT Pride Taiwan is fantastic for toilets Free and usually spotlessly clean facilities are everywhere While most public toilets are the squat style there are usually at least one or two stalls with sit down facilities They often also have toilet paper Western style toilets are standard in hotels and apartments Many restaurants ask you not to flush used toilet paper but to put it in the wastebasket beside your throne Advertisement Advertisement
