done the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower Sasha Brady Feb min read Share Rue Denoyez in Belleville Kate Devine for Lonely Planet I go to Paris as often as I can I think Iâ ve been about times now maybe more I always get requests from friends and family on what to do there where to eat and drink and what to buy and I thought after last year s Olympics and all eyes on Paris it would be best to throw all my recommendations into one comprehensive weekend itinerary for you too Advertisement To start off I ve laid out the first day s recommendations at a gentle pace to help you get your bearings As the days progress the itinerary unfolds with more activities in popular neighborhoods and also in the lesser visited corners of Paris that truly belong to Parisians But before we get to the fun stuff here are some things to consider ahead of booking your trip When to arrive If you can arrive on Thursday and stay for three days many museums shops and restaurants close on Sunday and Monday Seasonally March to May and September to October are the best times to visit for thinner crowds and good weather How to get from the airport Most international flights arrive at Charles de Gaulle Airport From there you can take the direct RER B train which stops at several major stations in Paris including Gare du Nord which has excellent city wide transport connections Getting around town The quickest way to get around Paris is the Metro and RER trains Use the RATP IDF MobilitÃ s and SNCF apps for journey planning The cheapest way to travel is with the Navigo Easy card which you can download for free via the RATP app and use it as contactless pay or purchase the card at Metro RER stations and RATP outlets Biking is another great way to get around especially since Paris has recently expanded its extensive network of cycling lanes You can rent bikes by the hour or at a fixed daily or weekly rate from various operators like Paris Ã vÃ lo Rentabike Paris VÃ lib and more What to pack Your checklist is right here Where to stay If it s your first time in Paris stay in Le Marais where you ll be within walking distance of major museums For repeat visitors try anywhere in the arrondissement Canal St Martin or Belleville These areas feel very lived in and they re home to some of the best restaurants in Paris I usually go to Belleville and stay at Babel Left Shakespeare and Company in the Latin Quarter Salvador Maniquiz Shutterstock Right Cafe Nuances Kate Devine for Lonely Planet Thursday Latin Quarter Ile de Paris Charonne Morning Start your day with a visit to Mokonuts Bakery for a coffee and sweet treat This tiny bustling cafe just off Rue du Faubourg Saint Antoine that is well loved by locals for its irresistibly chewy cookies in flavors like miso sesame olive white chocolate and coconut Aosa dried seaweed but you can keep it simple with peanut butter and chocolate chip too How to spend the day Take a leisurely stroll across the Seine to the Latin Quarter one of Paris s oldest neighborhoods Along the way browse the bouquinistes the open air booksellers who have graced the riverbanks since the century Continue to Shakespeare and Company the iconic English language bookshop that transports you back to a quieter older Paris despite the constant flow of visitors What I love about this bookshop is that you re encouraged to linger so find a cozy chair to peruse your book selectionsâ preferably near wherever the resident cat is napping From there walk to Notre Dame which reopened to visitors in December or take a short stroll to Conciergerie Most of us know it as the place where Marie Antoinette and other prisoners of the Revolution spent their final days but Conciergerie is also home to Europe s largest surviving medieval hall Salle des Gens dâ Armes which regularly hosts art culture and history exhibitions If it s a sunny day head next door to the tiny chapel of Sainte Chapelle to see the world s largest collection of century stained glass sparkle in the sunshine On warmer days cross back over the river grab an iced coffee from CafÃ Nuances and enjoy it in the Jardins des Tuileries Advertisement Dinner Recommending Septime one of my favorite restaurants in Paris is a bit of a gamble The issue isn t the food which is sublime but rather the fact that they don t take reservations and it s always busy You might get lucky on the night but if not add your name to the waiting list and pop over to their beautiful wine bar next door Septime La Cave one of our favorite late night haunts until they call you If you don t want to wait consider Waly Fay a two minute walk away a Senegalese restaurant that serves perfect aloco fried plantains and fish dumplings in tomato sauce or Bistrot Paul Bert five minutes away where you can make a reservation in advance to enjoy straight ahead classics like steak frites Left Passage MoliÃ re in Le Marais Kate Devine for Lonely Planet Right Rue Ste Croix de la Bretonnerie in Le Marais Amir Hamja for Lonely Planet Friday Le Marais Oberkampf Morning Kick off your day early with a stroll through Le Marais to admire the beautifully preserved medieval and Renaissance styles of buildings like the century Place des Vosges and the Picasso Museum in the HÃ tel SalÃ For breakfast grab a coffee and the divine cacio e pepe sandwich at Christophe Louie and top it off with a rose brioche How to spend the day A New Yorker once told me Le Marais feels like the West Village and I suppose it does in a way with its cafes galleries and boutiques Spend the day wandering through its creative quarter with visits to unique stores like Merci for homewares Boketto for cool vintage furniture MÃ lodies Graphiques for beautiful stationery and Thanx God Iâ m a VIP for vintage fashion When it s lunchtime head to Chez Janou definitely book ahead and save room for the famous chocolate mousse or go for a charcuterie with wine at The Butcher of Paris in MarchÃ des Enfants Rouges Afterward take advantage of the free museums in the area The MusÃ e Carnavalet has a brilliant collection of artifacts showcasing Parisian history and one of the most beautiful museum bookstores and at Maisons Victor Hugo you can explore the personal items of the legendary poet and author Dinner Le Marais isn t my favorite area for dinner unless you can snag a reservation at Parcelles good luck so take the Metro about minutes to the Arts et MÃ tiers stop for natural wine and a snack specifically the giant butter beans with mandarin oil at tiny La Buvette wine bar before walking five minutes to Le Servan for French food with an Asian twist The seasonal menu changes all the time so while I can t recommend a specific dish I can tell you I ve never had anything here that I didn t love Left Rue Denoyez in Belleville Amir Hamja for Lonely Planet Right View from Rue Caulincourt in Montmartre Kate Devine for Lonely Planet Saturday St Ouen Montmartre Belleville Morning The MarchÃ aux Puces St Ouen or Les Puces is the largest flea market in the world and it s open on weekends and Mondays on the outskirts of Paris To get there head to Porte de Clignancourt on Line Even if you don t plan to shop it s worth visiting for the energy and people watching alone you ll encounter all sorts of characters here some of the most stylish people you ve ever seen as well as the most eccentricâ a true representation of Parisian life Go mid morning to avoid the afternoon crowds as it can get quite busy Start with a coffee at La Chope des Puces Once energized wander through Paul Bert for vintage fashion finds Serpette for everything from antique kitchenware to designer luggage and elegant silk scarves and Vernsaison for knick knacks and art How to spend the day Hop on the Metro to the Montmartre district getting off at BarbÃ s Rochechouart a minute ride While this is one of the most visited areas in Paris it s very pretty and away from the overpriced brasseries and souvenir shops you ll find plenty to do Visit Picasso s old studio Le Bateau Lavoir peruse the tiny MusÃ e de Montmartre to learn about the area s bohemian past and wander the winding streets to find the windmills that Van Gogh depicted in his paintings Take a look around the fabric shops of St Pierre and then head to Halle St Pierre an Art Nouveau building with cool art exhibits and a lovely on site cafe where you can stop for lunch Evening Belleville is one of my favorite neighborhoods in Paris because it feels super local Start your evening with cocktails flavored with ingredient combinations you ve likely never tried before in lively Combat When the clock strikes dinner time take your pick between the bistro style L Orillion the pork belly with apples and hazelnuts is a must Le Cheval D Or for Asian style French and Italian classics La Colline for a very neighborhood vibe I dream about their fried sardines with padron peppers or Candide the broccoli with anchovy butter for starters and Normandy chicken with crispy fries for mains is the perfect meal Wind your weekend up at Studio de l Ermitage a jazz club that hosts live music on Saturdays until late Or if jazz isn t your thing jump on the Metro and heard towards Porte de St Ouen station near the flea market to get to Hasard Ludique a buzzy inclusive bar and dance hall that always has events on It s inside a former train station on Paris abandoned railway line and is a great place to meet locals If you want to go there early skip dinner in Belleville and go to Les deux Coupoles instead They serve excellent bistro classics to a soundtrack of music and Hasard Ludique is just a minute walk away Have more time Consider one of our favorite day trips from Paris Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local
