drink in Istanbul Jennifer Hattam Sep min read Share Taste the best flavors of Istanbul with our guide to where to eat and drink Shutterstock From street snacks grabbed on the go to hours long breakfasts or nights spent in meyhane taverns Istanbul is a city that loves to eat New restaurants are constantly opening and old favorites remain packed despite an ongoing economic crisis in that has sent food prices soaring Though they share the national passion for traditional Turkish cuisine Istanbulites also love a good international food trend whether itâ s a craze for burgers or San Sebastian cheesecake Over the years Iâ ve lived in the city my own taste buds have been more excited about the dramatic increase in the number and variety of restaurants serving the cuisines of new immigrant groups from Indonesian to Yemeni food Advertisement Hereâ s just a small selection of some of the places where I like to take friends to eat and drink when they re visiting Istanbul Breakfast can be anything from pan fried eggs and spicy beef sausage to a simple sesame seed covered bread ring Jennifer Hattam for Lonely Planet Breakfast Breakfast in Istanbul can be as simple as a simit the ubiquitous sesame seed covered bread ring sold at street carts and bakeries all around the city On weekends though itâ s all about a leisurely serpme kahvaltÄ a lavish breakfast spread of small bites â olives cheeses jams pastries eggs and much more â thatâ s meant to be lingered over and shared Combine breakfast with Bosphorus views at the string of cafe restaurants lining the shoreline near the Rumeli HisarÄ fortress my pick is an old favorite Kale CafÃ which now has two locations just steps from each other on Yahya Kemal Caddesi Iâ m partial to the somewhat shabbier looking one at No closer to the Bosphorus bridge Closer to the city center thereâ s an entire street in the BeÅ iktaÅ neighborhood devoted to breakfast While some newer spots there are more style than substance the original Ã akmak KahvaltÄ Salonu is still the best for menemen soft cooked eggs with tomatoes and peppers or sucuklu yumurta pan fried eggs with spicy beef sausage Donâ t forget the side of bal kaymak thick cream drizzled with honey Go early to both places to avoid the late morning weekend crowds Advertisement Find the best traditional Turkish coffee at Mandabatmaz in an alley in BeyoÄ lu Jennifer Hattam for Lonely Planet Coffee and tea For traditional Turkish coffee kahve itâ s hard to top Mandabatmaz a BeyoÄ lu classic where the drink â cooked over a flame in a small long handled metal pot called a cezve â is served up thick and rich Established in as a tiny one room cafe itâ s expanded into the neighboring building in recent years but perching on the alley seats is still the best way to soak up the vibe You wouldnâ t know it from the dozens of trendy cafes dishing out flat whites and iced lattes in the KarakÃ y Cihangir and Moda neighborhoods but still predominately has a tea culture with reportedly the highest per capita consumption in the world The Tarihi Ã Ä naraltÄ Ã ay BahÃ esi in Ã engelkÃ y along the Bosphorus on the Asian side of the city has a pretty unbeatable view for sipping your brew Lunch could be a casual buffet while exploring the sights of BeyoÄ lu or head to Fatih for flavors from Istanbul s immigrant communities Jennifer Hattam for Lonely Planet Lunch When Iâ m out and about visiting art galleries and museums in the BeyoÄ lu area the colorful buffet counter at Hayvore is my go to for a quick bite I love its Black Sea dishes like karalahana Ã orbasÄ kale soup hamsili pilav seasoned rice with anchovies and the custardy puff pastry dessert laz bÃ reÄ i When the meal is the main point though I like to gather up some friends and head to the Fatih district west of the Laleli tram stop where immigrant communities have enlivened the Istanbul eating scene This is the place to go for Syrian fatteh a comforting mix of chickpeas pita chips and garlicky tahini yogurt sauce at Al Muallim or spicy green beans and laghman hand pulled noodles at the Uyghur restaurant KadÄ kÃ y Produce Market is a permanent fixture but keep an eye out for weekly neighborhood markets too Jennifer Hattam for Lonely Planet Food markets Thereâ s no better way to get insight into the ingredients that make up Turkish cuisine â from colorful strands of dried eggplant husks to candy shop like jars of pickled produce to village made cheese and butter â than visiting an open air food market Itâ s a great way to while away an hour or two wandering people watching and sampling the wares until you find the best ones to buy The stalls at the KadÄ kÃ y Produce Market and around the KadÄ nlar PazarÄ square in Fatih are permanent fixtures while most parts of the city typically have their own semt pazar neighborhood market that sets up shop on a weekly basis The Wednesday Market in the streets around the Fatih Mosque is among the biggest Salon Galata serves delicious contemporary Mediterranean food Salon Galata Dinner No trip to Istanbul is complete without a meyhane night a long lively evening working your way through an array of meze hot starters and fish typically accompanied by rakÄ s potent anise based spirit or wine AsmalÄ Cavit in BeyoÄ lu is a classic of the genre reserve a table in the busier memorabilia filled upstairs for the full experience Along the banks of the Golden Horn the ramshackle looking CibalikapÄ BalÄ kcÌ Ä sÄ is another favorite choice for meze and seafood with its own unique dishes like mung beans with pomegranate molasses or sundried tomatoes stuffed with sea bass For more contemporary pan Mediterranean fare I like Salon Galata in KarakÃ y with its gorgeously old fashioned high ceilinged dining room and creative salads local cheese plates hearty pastas and tahini soufflÃ for dessert Dinner reservations arenâ t usually an issue on weeknights on weekends if you havenâ t booked ahead I recommend arriving early â Istanbulites typically like to eat late Expect a nice dinner in Istanbul to set you back at least per person more if youâ re drinking alcohol Bar Though KadÄ kÃ y has probably claimed Istanbulâ s nightlife crown especially for the younger crowd Iâ m still loyal to my neighborhood of BeyoÄ lu Behind Galatasaray High School revelers spill out into the short street Hayriye Caddesi until late at night from hip lively establishments like Noh Radio Bar where DJs spin electronic music and Tavern known for its creative cocktails Advertisement Advertisement
