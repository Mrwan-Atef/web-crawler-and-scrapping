Nov min read Share Sydney s Newtown neighborhood is a thriving hipster enclave juancsanchezherrera Shutterstock As one of Australia s biggest busiest and most glamorous cities Sydney is an intoxicating experience like no other Naturally blessed in a way few other urban sprawls could match it boasts a string of stunning beaches and one of the most iconic harbor views on the planet Like elsewhere in the nation the outdoors reigns supreme in Sydney Whether it s surfing the waves with the city skyline as your backdrop enjoying a bracing coastal walk or enjoying sumptuous seafood on the outside terrace of one of the city s many incredible restaurants This multicultural hedonistic metropolis has numerous districts to explore each with their own distinct character We ve got all the intel you need on Sydney s key neighborhoods Newtown the Inner West Sydney s coolest neighborhoods Advertisement Sydneyâ s sprawling Inner West is a mixed brew of students urban hippies lifestyle focused professional couples and artists Itâ s the place to go if you like your food plant based your wines organic and your cafes pooch friendly At its beginning is the University of Sydney a bastion of old world architecture dominating the tiny suburbs of Camperdown Darlington and Chippendale Its Chau Chak Wing Museum is a gloriously eclectic assemblage of artifacts As well as plenty of students nearby Redfern has a significant Aboriginal community and is the birthplace of the urban Aboriginal civil rights movement in Australia Glebe is also home to a long established Aboriginal community students and cool bookstores The most famous â burb of the Inner West Newtown is lined with quirky boutiques yoga studios and restaurants from budget friendly Thai bring your own wine to modish bars serving upmarket grazing creations Itâ s climbing the social rungs but is still free thinking and bolshy Turn left out of the station to hit King Streetâ s vibrant vegan strip Each of the Inner West s suburbs has a very different vibe so it s worth exploring a few of them Hit Petersham for Portuguese Leichhardt for Italian Alexandria for warehouse chic Marrickville for microbreweries and distilleries and Erskineville for its endearing village vibe and crop of pubs and cafes Though hotel options are limited staying here and absorbing the local vibe is a good choice with the sights of the center just a short train ride away The iconic Bondi Beach is a huge draw for both visitors and locals Getty Images Bondi Coogee the Eastern Beaches Best for singles and sun worshippers Beautiful arcs of sand framed by jagged cliffs the eastern beaches are a big part of the Sydney experience Most famous of all is the broad sweep of Bondi Beach with its distracting scenery and constant procession of beautiful people This is where Sydney comes to see and be seen preferably wearing as little as possible The unique flavor of Bondi has been greatly influenced by the Jewish British and Kiwi immigrants who populated it before it became hip Although popular with tourists beyond the main road in Bondi Campbell Parade youâ ll find cafes and pubs where Sydneysiders are in the majority South of Bondi and best reached via the spectacular coastal walk that hugs the cliffs and bays of this beautiful bit of Sydney real estate Bronte is a steep sided beach neighborhood its bowl shaped park strewn with picnic tables and barbecues Further south is the concrete fringed safe swimming inlet of Clovelly a great place to dust off your snorkel Next stop heading south is Coogee with a wide and handsome beach and lively backpacker and local scene in the pubs and shops As well as the beaches locals also love the iconic saltwater pools dotted along this stretch of coast The eastern beaches are prime hostel territory and also house a smattering of appealing boutique sleeps There s a glorious vibe here but it s at least minutes by bus to downtown Sydney Advertisement Sydney s Gay Lesbian Mardi Gras is a joyful celebration and beloved by locals and visitors Getty Images iStockphoto Paddington Surry Hills Darlinghurst Best for food and retail therapy The rows of Victorian terrace houses of this once working class neighborhood remain but they now command eye watering seven figure price tags and are home to wealthy young urban professionals including a strong LGTBIQ community Style rules the roost whether you are browsing fashion boutiques keeping up with the very latest coffee trends or luxuriating in the tasting menu at that upmarket eating house everyone is talking about This is a prime place to stay with excellent boutique hotels and a neighborhood vibe within very easy reach of the city center The steep streets of Surry Hills house a cornucopia of some of Sydneyâ s best and most innovative restaurants fabulous cafes and upmarket pubs The warehouses lining the suburbâ s moody lower canyons near Central Station are the remnants of the local rag trade and print industry They now contain coffee shops art galleries interior design outlets and apartments Just to the northeast of the city Darlinghurst is synonymous with Sydneyâ s vibrant and visible LGBTIQ community The shabby lower end of Oxford Street has traditionally been Sydneyâ s sequinned mile and while itâ s seen better days itâ s still home to most of the cityâ s dwindling gay venues and the Mardi Gras parade Paddington also known as Paddo is an elegant expensive area of beautifully restored terrace houses and steep leafy streets Built over an ancient walking track used by the Gadigal people the suburbâ s artery is Oxford Street extending from nearby Darlinghurst but far more elegant in this stretch The best time to visit is on Saturday when the local artisan market in the grounds of a church complements the high street boutiques that sell designer labels â both local and international Make sure you get off Oxford Street too much of the suburb s character and local life is further into the district The Calyx is inside the Royal Botanic Garden in central Sydney Jay Stocker Shutterstock Circular Quay and the Rocks Best for historic buildings and major sights At some stage youâ ll almost certainly end up at the Rocks â you havenâ t really been to Sydney if you donâ t The Rocks unrecognizable from the squalid place it was in the convict era now serves as an olde worlde tourist focus There are a number of major Sydney sights in this very visitor focused neighborhood including Sydney Opera House the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Royal Botanic Garden but itâ s also worth exploring away from the big ticket attractions strolling the characterful streets of Millerâ s Point or admiring the waterfront perspectives offered by Barangaroo Reserve Booking an Indigenous led tour of the Botanic Garden or the Rocks area is highly recommended and will let you look beyond colonial history and begin to understand the ancient and profound relationship of the Gadigal people with this land Return at night to down a beverage in a historic pub or catch a show at a Walsh Bay theater Some of Sydneyâ s swankiest hotels and restaurants can also be found here with some special harbor views on offer The most spectacular way to get here is to get the train or ferry to Milsonâ s Point then walk back into the Rocks across the Sydney Harbour Bridge minutes This gets you up close and personal with the cityâ s beloved Coathanger with the roar of traffic on your right and a glorious Sydney panorama on your left Kings Cross Potts Point and Woolloomooloo Best for backpackers and budget travelers Close to the city and with remnants of its red light district history Kings Cross attracts backpackers and Sydney eccentrics with proximity to the city and great places to eat and drink that wonâ t break the budget Next door to the Cross gracious tree lined Potts Point and Elizabeth Bay seem worlds away And then down by the water the old sailors district of Woolloomooloo â youâ re not a Sydneysider if you canâ t spell it â has glitzy wharf restaurants and a handful of characterful pubs It makes sense to start a reconnaissance of the area around the Cross itself at the top of William Street and let gravity draw you downwards From the Coca Cola sign that marks the entrance to the district explore Darlinghurst Road â where touristy shops and backpacker hostels outnumber the dwindling strip club scene these days â before strolling leafy Victoria Street and other upmarket avenues and cafes of Potts Point Down by the docks Woolloomooloo has also cleaned up its act Iconic Harryâ s Cafe de Wheels and the navy base are still here but drunken sailors are in shorter supply and the wharf is a glitzy parade of see and be seen at restaurants From here itâ s a very short hop to Sydneyâ s premier classical gallery the Art Gallery of NSW The spectacular Sydney Modern building â with a notable focus on the art of Indigenous Australia â opened here in December Taking the ferry to Manly gives you all the beautiful harbor sights for a cut price Taras Vyshnya Shutterstock Manly and the Northern Beaches Best for the surf crowd Laid back Manly clings to a narrow strip of land between ocean and harbor beaches With its shaggy haired surfers and relaxed locals it makes for a refreshing change from some of the stuffier harbor suburbs nearby Manly s name comes from Governor Phillip s description of the confident Kai ymay warriors he met while scouting the area in the early days of the penal colony The Corso is the main mall that connects Manlyâ s ocean and harbor beaches where surf shops burger joints juice bars and pubs are plentiful The refurbished Manly Wharf has classier pubs and restaurants and there are some good cafes and small bars scattered around the back streets To get here take Sydney s best ferry journey â essentially a harbor cruise without the commentary Itâ s only half an hour from Circular Quay making Manly a great option for those who want a relaxed place to stay Beyond the beach there are also great walks to and around North Head and the Manly Scenic Walkway to the Spit Bridge Stretching from Manly north to magnificent Palm Beach the area known as the Northern Beaches marries suburbia with spectacular strips of sand nearly all with excellent surfing when conditions are right One good reason to base yourself out here would be to explore the local area which is short on world famous attractions but rich with quintessential experiences Climb to Barrenjoey Lighthouse for a classic picture of Palm Beach and Pittwater in winter you can stop to spot whales migrating or have a cold beer overlooking the sea at the glitzy boutique hotel The Newport Chinatown has expanded beyond its original modest stretch to become a thriving hub Natsicha Wetchasart Shutterstock Darling Harbour Chinatown and Pyrmont Best for classic tourist attractions Dotted between the flyovers is Darling Harbour Sydney s purpose built tourist hub opened in to mark the bicentenary of Australiaâ s beginning as a colony Every other inch of this former dockland is given over to visitor amusements including Sydney Sea Life Aquarium and the excellent Australian National Maritime Museum plus bars and restaurants the best places to eat are in the north of the area at the Barangaroo precinct Darling Harbour has a different atmosphere at night with strolling couples replacing the sun frazzled families Firework displays occur with alarming frequency most Saturday nights go off with a bang The southern end of the Darling Harbour area melds into Sydneyâ s ever expanding Chinatown a buzz of food courts restaurants and bubble tea joints that is one of the cityâ s most characterful and best value districts to eat West of Darling Harbour dive into Pyrmont for historic reconverted warehouses and a more local Sydney scene Here the Sydney Fish Market is a must see if you re a seafood fan and the Star Casino shelters several excellent restaurants in and around it If you fancy stretching your legs there s some sensational harborside strolling here far removed from the tourist beat Pyrmontâ s upmarket hotels make good
