Zinara Rathnayake Nov min read Share The more time you can spend in Sri Lanka the better both to take in major sights and to just relax into island life John Crux Photography Getty Images Sri Lanka is a diverse island home to many different ethnicities religions and cultures I was born and raised in different regions of this island nation but Iâ ve spent enough time away from home to understand that for many visitors Sri Lanka is often viewed as a smaller India â an island catering to the usual sun sea and sand cliches Iâ ve witnessed my home transform through its highs and lows and watched my peopleâ s resilience shine through after long periods of uncertainty And today this breathtaking island of beaches rainforests mountains spice laden food and friendly locals makes for an excellent travel destination So let s start with the two most common questions â is Sri Lanka safe to visit Yes absolutely Is it always very hot I won t sugarcoat it â youâ ll either embrace the humidity or hate it entirely Here are some more things you need to know before going to Sri Lanka Two weeks is a good amount of time but a month is better Friends from abroad joke that when the plane lands and takes off in Sri Lanka it will cover the entire length of the island Yes it looks tiny on a world map but with so much to do and see youâ ll need at least a month to travel to cave temples in Dambulla ferry to far flung islands in Jaffna and hike in the Knuckles Mountain Range There are things to check off your list of course such as climbing the UNESCO listed Lionâ s Rock in Sigiriya but itâ s more of a place to slow down and embrace island life Advertisement If you are tight on time you can squeeze in a visit to Sri Lanka in two weeks Spend a week exploring the south coast beaches with a wildlife safari and another week split between cultural sites in Kandy and the central highlands Travel times are long and anything less than two weeks means youâ ll spend most of your time in the back of a vehicle Sri Lanka s beaches are incredible but there s also plenty of adventures to be had further inland JohnnyGreig Getty Images Pick your season wisely Most visitors assume the only good time to visit Sri Lanka is from December to April This is of course the high season and the best time to explore the south coast beaches like Unawatuna and Tangalle with calmer seas and sunny blue skies However the weather varies depending on where you are on the island When the south coast experiences monsoons from May until October the east coast home to some of the best beaches and surf breaks in the country like Arugam Bay and Nilaveli has days filled with sunshine And even if you are here during the rainy season it doesnâ t rain the whole day Itâ s mostly a torrential downpour that lasts for less than an hour Off season travel has its perks â prices drop and attractions are free of large crowds And remember to not spend all your time at the beach Yes the beaches are great but Sri Lanka has more than miles of palm lined shores Head inland to see the countryâ s rice fields clay pot cooking in small villages mountain towns with pleasant weather and generational artists tending to their crafts Get your jabs sorted Sri Lanka doesnâ t require any compulsory vaccines but consult your healthcare provider at least eight weeks before your visit to see what jabs you should get Vaccinations for tetanus are usually recommended for all travelers and some may also need vaccinations for hepatitis A hepatitis B and typhoid If youâ re staying for more than a month consider getting a rabies shot rabies can be fatal if not properly treated and animals like monkeys dogs and cats can carry the parasite Pack for heat and humidity Seriously Sri Lanka is blazing hot and that s no exaggeration Temperatures in Colombo and south coast cities like Galle can reach C F with over humidity throughout the year The sweltering heat mixed with extreme humidity means that youâ ll need easy breezy breathable outfits For some reason locals tend to prefer tight denims but that s not the most comfortable option if you re not used to the climate Pack natural fabrics Long maxi skirts linen shorts dresses loose fitting trousers hats flip flops and sandals work great Add some bright colors and pretty floral prints to blend in with the locals A sweater and a raincoat come in handy if youâ re visiting high country towns like Nuwara Eliya where temperatures can drop below C F in the evenings and where itâ s mostly wet and rainy Also remember to keep yourself hydrated and take plenty of electrolytes Coconut water is available everywhere and itâ s a great way to cool off Advertisement The famous blue trains are a must do when you visit Sri Lanka SurangaLK Shutterstock Book hill country trains ahead in the high season Those blue trains riding past rolling tea gardens that pop up on your Instagram feed Yes they re a must do and this train ride from Kandy to Ella is often considered one of the most beautiful train journeys in the world Just remember to book your seats a few weeks in advance if you re traveling during the peak season between December and April The best place to book these tickets is the official website of Sri Lanka Railways Trains also have some non reserved coaches where you can just turn up at the station buy a ticket and ride but these compartments tend to get packed with locals going to work and school and hawkers selling tea and snacks â it s unlikely you ll get a seat I recommend booking a tourist train such as Ella Odyssey and Dunhinda Odyssey The tickets are a bit pricier but the trains briefly stop at key sights along the way so you get to see cascading falls vibrant Hindu temples and charming hill country railway stations with manicured flower beds Plus you have enough time to snap photos Hotels arenâ t always places to rest your head Hotel De Plaza Hotel De Pilawoos These are some â hotelsâ youâ ll come across on your travels but they arenâ t places to sleep They are in fact where many locals go for a quick bite or an affordable filling meal No one really knows how this tradition of calling hole in the walls hotels began but if you want to sit side by side with locals and dig into a plate of greasy kottu a carb heavy mishmash of vegetables meat egg and cheese with a sugary frothy milk tea this is the place to do it Full moon days are considered holy days by Sri Lankan Buddhists and no alcohol is sold Cezary Wojtkowski Shutterstock Thereâ s no booze on full moon days All full moon days are considered poya days by Sri Lankan Buddhists where devotees visit temples and attend religious activities These auspicious holy days are also dry days which means that alcohol is not sold in supermarkets bars or restaurants You donâ t need to speak Sinhala or Tamil but locals will love it Sri Lanka has three main official languages Sinhala Tamil and English Many locals speak at least basic English and you wonâ t have a hard time getting by as a visitor But if you throw in a few words like ayubowan meaning â may you live longâ in Sinhala and vanakkam meaning â helloâ in Tamil locals will really appreciate it although youâ ll notice that locals donâ t greet each other the same way and are more used to a simple good morning Kohomada â how are youâ in Sinhala and enna kathai â whatâ s upâ in Tamil are more common As a rule of thumb most people in the south of the country speak Sinhala and as you head north and east Tamil becomes more widespread Tamil is also spoken among the tea estate communities in the central highlands It s important to stay covered up and respectful at religious sites Ruwan Walpola Shutterstock Dress appropriately â especially at religious sites You must cover your shoulders and knees and remove footwear before entering religious sites like Buddhist temples Hindu temples and mosques In some Hindu temples men have to remove their shirts â always pay attention to signs outside Youâ ll also avoid unwanted attention if you dress modestly on public transport and in small towns and rural villages especially if you are a woman traveling alone Swimwear including bikinis is perfectly fine at the beach Learn to eat with your right hand Sri Lankans eat with their right hand The left hand is generally considered unclean and reserved for toilet matters We use our fingertips to mix different curry dishes and condiments with rice Things like idiyappam thin steamed rice noodle mats arenâ t just dipped in curry but are soaked and mixed with gravy before eating Locals will appreciate it if you learn to eat with your hands too Tipping is not mandatory but itâ s appreciated You arenâ t expected to tip but drivers and service staff very much appreciate it especially since Sri Lanka is still recovering from its worst ever economic crisis So if you experience good service you can leave of the bill as a tip If a restaurant charges a service charge Sri Lankans generally donâ t tip as itâ s split among the staff It s better to let someone else take the wheel and avoid driving in Sri Lanka Simon Montgomery Getty Images Prepare to take the backseat While you technically can drive in Sri Lanka I strongly recommend you donâ t Many foreign travelers ride bikes and even rent tuk tuks to travel across the country but driving in Sri Lanka isnâ t always safe Locals have adopted a driving culture of their own that doesnâ t adhere to road safety guidelines cars and tuk tuks often overtake recklessly and buses are driven with little regard for other road users Road accidents are common so itâ s better to leave driving to locals and stick to public transport and taxis Many long distance routes have comfortable and affordable air conditioned buses If you are not pressed for time trains are a great way to get around And tuk tuks can pretty much take you anywhere Do not drink the tap water Some locals do drink tap water as it s chlorinated to the safety standards of drinking water but most Sri Lankans tend to boil and filter tap water before drinking However as a visitor it is best to avoid tap water as you may not be used to the microorganisms in it Also avoid brushing your teeth with tap water You can find mineral water pretty much everywhere but look for the safety standards seal and check if the lid is intact To reduce your plastic waste bring a reusable bottle and consider traveling with water purification tablets Be aware of tuk tuk scams Use common sense in crowded cities like Colombo and donâ t fall for tuk tuk drivers promising to take you to spas gem boutiques and the best attractions in the city Theyâ re mostly after a commission from those businesses and it might be added to your bill Follow the crowds and donâ t listen to anyone if they tell you a particular entrance to a place is â closed â Avoid getting into tuk tuks without a meter Uber works in main cities while PickMe â Sri Lankaâ s homegrown ride hailing app â works in most places Youâ ll see tuk tuk drivers gather at parking lots across Sri Lanka and these drivers often show resistance to ride hailing apps and can occasionally start brawls with Uber or PickMe riders Walk a few hundred meters away from them before ordering your PickMe or Uber Elephant encounters are a big draw for visitors to Sri Lanka but give these magnificent animals space HildaWeges Getty Images Maintain your distance from wildlife As a tropical island youâ ll see wildlife everywhere you go in Sri Lanka from peacocks to elephants and monitor lizards that often frequent even the urban gardens Some interior roads in Sri Lanka fall through elephant corridors that wild elephants use for moving between their natural habitats in search of food and water If you see an elephant on the road you can observe them from afar but keep a respectful distance and don t try to feed them Youâ ll also often see monkeys across Sri Lanka Donâ t try to feed them as they are increasingly becoming dependent on tourists providing food which leads to conflict in many areas across the island Avoid feeding or touching any wildlife at all costs and remember to maintain a safe distance Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Sri Lanka Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers Everywhere Follow
