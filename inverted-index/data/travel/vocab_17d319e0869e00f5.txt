why these rooms with a view of another world are thriving and how to experience one yourself The benefits of cultural immersion Seventy percent of respondents to American Express Travel s Travel Trends Report said they were interested in vacations that featured cultural immersion If you have an experience that s awe inducing or extraordinary sleeping in a safari tent in the middle of Africa versus drinking margaritas at a beach hotel it causes your dopamine and serotonin to rise says Paul J Zak a professor of economics and psychology at California s Claremont University who studies the science of immersion That creates peak memories which are stored more deeply in your brain Immersive stays are about getting travelers to experience a place and come back and genuinely be able to say

immersive hotels Want to make an immersive hotel part of your next trip Research whether a property or tour company offers genuine interaction with locals and their way of life and whether the hotel financially benefits the community You want to feel like you re visiting a community and that its people are on equal footing with you says Hardcastle Look for a place that incorporates locals in a way that has them not catering to you as a tourist but encountering you as a friend Find out whether travel can make you more empathetic Properties that employ and seek input from locals can provide experiences benefiting both travelers and residents For instance Kenya s Kalepo Camp provides overnight stays in comfortable safari tents near the herding grounds of the semi nomadic Samburu people

interior campfire When you create spaces that bring people together it results in what we call euphoric bonding says neuroaesthetics expert Robyn Landau That combats loneliness and drives empathy Landau whose Kinda Studios uses science to study how humans perceive art and other built environments believes visiting places that feel very far from everyday lives helps travelers truly unplug and get away from the mental chatter In other words a deep dive into another culture amounts to a true vacation Hotels that embrace another place Culturally immersive lodgings usually fall into two types rustic village stays where you bunk in simple digs amid a community and more luxurious hotels where the architecture and programming reflect the destination The sort of stay you choose depends both on your budget and how adventurous you are With higher end immersive hotels guest rooms might be situated in traditional dwellings the vintage wooden Khmer houses of Sala Lodges in Siem Riep Cambodia or
