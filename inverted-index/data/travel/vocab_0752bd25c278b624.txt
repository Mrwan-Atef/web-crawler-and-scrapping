Apr min read Share Experience all the beauty and history Sicily has to offer with these amazing experiences Giovenda Shutterstock Something of a mini continent the island of Sicily in Italy ticks most boxes Adventurer art lover beach bum ruin explorer this rugged chunk of sun spun land at the crossroads of the Tyrrhenian Ionian and Mediterranean seas has enticed ancient and modern peoples with its charms since time immemorial The result one of Europe s richest and most extraordinary histories with an unmatched booty of artistic and drop dead gorgeous natural treasures The food and drink s not bad either Turquoise cove to ridgetop temple Byzantine mosaics to chubby cheeked baroque putti cherubs Windswept olive and lemon groves and dry parched gardens planted with pomegranate fig and carob trees Traveling around Sicily might feel like extreme sensory overload but it exudes Sicilian dolce far niente sweetness of doing nothing Advertisement July and August are the busiest months but every month has its own beauty The very real temptation of simply eating and drinking your way around Sicily aside here are nine top things to see and do on the island Discover Sicily s backstory in a kaleidoscope of UNESCO mosaics Scantily clad Olympians African animals lepers deities mythical monsters Adam and Eve the wild stories told by Sicily s Herculean cache of Roman Byzantine and Arab Norman mosaics will have you hooked for days Begin your mosaic mini tour in the glittering gold cathedral crowning the hilltop Monreale built for William II in to upstage grandfather Roger II s magnificent building accomplishments in CefaluÌ Duomo di and Palermo Cappella Palatina Continue the mosaic fest in Villa Romana del Casale a Roman patrician s palatial country pad a couple of hours drive inland Stromboli Etna s sister volcano Vista Images Getty Images Adventure up Sicily s other volcano on Stromboli Hiking or mountain biking up the emblematic slopes of massive brooding Mount Etna is a classic But if you re into a fire spitting volcano with a primordial village vibe and post hike pizza with fireworks hit the less sung Stromboli â legend says that wind god Aeolus and other mythological deities had a hand in this island s marvelous creation But a guided trek at sunset from the whitewashed village up charred slopes shows the harsh reality of living next to a volcano a tempestuous environment ruled by Mother Nature alone From the smaller volcano s Sciara del Fucco viewpoint at only accessible with a guide watch red hot rocks roll down the lava charred mountainside into the sea and then hike back down by torchlight Wander ancient ruins in the Valley of the Temples by moonlight On Sicily s southern Mediterranean coast Agrigento s Valley of the Temples makes an impression like no other ruins on the island Strung out along a long rocky promontory where the ancient Greeks built sacred temples as holy beacons for sailors years ago the vast archaeological site is prized by UNESCO as one of the world s most outstanding monuments of Greek art and culture The magic peaks on summer evenings when the moon casts the ruins in a celestial iridescent light and the wind plucks tunes on the columns of ghostly Doric temples Advertisement Planning tip Sicily s flush of ancient Greek ruins runs deep Add hilltop Segesta and sea facing Selinunte both in western Sicily to your long weekend itinerary to bag the hat trick Taste vino with winegrowers on the slopes of Mount Etna Sun soaked grapes have always been grown on the island â this is Italy s second largest wine producing region after all But with the exception of sweet dessert wines like Marsala Sicilian wines are hard to come by outside Sicily Drink in local viticulture meet wine growers and swill sniff and sip wines produced on Mount Etna s fertile slopes along the Strada del Vino dell Etna Etna Wine Road This is not a road at all but a deliciously scenic train journey peppered with sumptuous villa wineries along the lower slopes of Europe s largest active volcano Planning tip The Strada s wine trains depart twice weekly from Riposto an hour s drive from Catania on the Ionian Coast Tickets include a guide and bus transfers to wineries for degustazione tasting A seaside view on Isola Bella Gary Yeowell Getty Images Splash and snorkel like a movie star on Isola Bella Vintage glamour queen Taormina is the springboard for chic sea dips and snorkeling forays in the crystal water that laps the pebble beach on Isola Bella â as bella beautiful as its name suggests The dot of an island linked by cable car to Taormina which is perched dramatically on a cliff high above lured Europe s aristocracy during the days of the Grand Tour and the literati likes of DH Lawrence in the Glitzy views of smoking Mount Etna and the Ionian Sea vie for the spotlight during summertime theater performances in its resplendent ancient Greek amphitheater Planning tip Taormina gets packed to bursting in July and August and all but shuts down between November and Easter April May September and October are best Learn about the Mafia past and present in Palermo Try to better understand what makes Sicily s disheveled high octane capital tick at No Mafia Memorial a multimedia space in a palazzo on Palermo s main street Corso Vittorio Emanuele that explains Mafiosi and anti Mafia history Combine the interesting if unsettling exhibitions with a contemplative walk along the powerful Wall of Legality street mural in rough and tumble Il Capo then snap a selfie on the opera house steps at Teatro Massimo where the iconic mafia shooting scene from Francis Ford Coppola s Godfather trilogy was filmed Admire prehistoric art in a cave on Levanzo When you tire of beach hopping by bicycle on the Egadi island of Favignana swap wheels for water and catch a ferry to pin prick Levanzo From its tiny port motorboats whip along the wave lashed coast to Grotta del Genovese a cave hidden high in the hillside that shelters Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic rock art Etchings of goats dolphins and donkeys reflect farming practices some years ago when a vast plain linked to the two islands Bookend the torch lit cave visit with huge glittering sea views Planning tip Cave visits must be booked online at least hours in advance Ditto in July and August for Liberty Lines hydrofoils to from Trapani on mainland Sicily and also Favignana To continue the rock art theme stay the night on Favignana in rooms at Giardino dell Impossible botanical gardens hewn in labyrinthine rock The Greek Theater in Syracuse Michele Ponzio Shutterstock Uncover the greatest city of ancient Magna Graecia in Syracuse It s mind boggling that small town Syracuse in southeast Sicily was the largest city in the ancient world in its heyday â bigger even than Athens and Corinth A near perfect encapsulation of Sicily s timeless beauty its once upon a time begins in BCE Split your time between the ancient island city of Ortygia â where honey hued medieval streets flow like ribbons down to the sea and open air food market brim with lunchtime oysters â and the evocative citrus scented ruins of Parco Archeologico della Neapolis Planning tip Bag a golden ticket for theater beneath the stars at Syracuse s supremely well preserved Greek amphitheater during May June s Festival del Teatro Greco Get off grid on the Aeolian island of Alicudi Magical and mesmerizing the Aeolian s second smallest island feels like a mischievous afterthought on the map As isolated a place as you ll find in the entire Mediterranean basin this sq km island has no roads â just a relentless succession of time wizened volcanic stone steps staggering mercilessly up to the craggy summit of Monte Montagnola After you step off the hydrofoil at the sleepy port simply follow the donkeys and mules uphill â they re the only means of transport on this old timer island Post hike watch fishermen clean fish and nets or track down a boatman at sundown to bathe in the peace and tranquility of aperitivo al tramonto early evening drinks at sunset Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Italy
