suburbs to observe the traditional festival celebrations in a more relaxed environment Carnaval Brazil When Usually in February or early March Where Rio de Janeiro Brazil Festival fever sweeps across Brazil each year starting five days before Lent and culminating at midday on Ash Wednesday The nationâ s greatest import Carnaval â derived from a Latin term meaning â farewell to meatâ â began as an extension of the Portuguese pre Lent festival of Entrudo Shrovetide Since then the festival has evolved into a South American spectacular with its own massive satellite economy The famous Carnaval held in Rio de Janeiro has also become a major celebration for the LGBTIQ community as well as attracting legions of international visitors These days the week of Carnaval in Rio sees a wildly hectic and uniquely Brazilian explosion of color as the city fills with samba dance parades bloco street parties in Rioâ s neighborhoods that can start as early as January and family friendly childrenâ s parties where kids create their own songs and dances Whatever else you do be sure to catch the main event in the center of the city when Brazilian dancers show off their samba skills at the that functions as the main stage during Carnaval Beer fuelled Oktoberfest is hailed as the world s biggest fair FooTToo Getty Images Oktoberfest Munich Germany When For days up to the first or occasionally second Sunday in October Advertisement Where Munich Bavaria Germany The worldâ s largest drink a thon and the traditional highlight of Bavaria â s annual events calendar Oktoberfest is one of the best known public gatherings on earth No other event manages to mix such a level of crimson faced humor drunken debauchery and excessive consumption of beer with so much tradition history and oompah music Some six million revelers descend on Munich from late September to enjoy two weeks chock full of community parades carnival rides traditional music uniquely Bavarian regalia including of course leather Lederhosen breeches and Dirndl dresses and locally brewed LÃ wenbrÃ u beer â made following German purity standards that date back to the century Oktoberfest is not called the worldâ s biggest fair for nothing and while most visitorsâ focus is on the bier beer thereâ s plenty going on away from the tents The focus of the party is the Theresienwiese festival ground to the west of Munichâ s city center Poccistrasse and Theresienwiese are the nearest U Bahn stations The funfair with its big wheel old fashioned test your strength booths and scary century thrill rides is an obvious attraction but magic performances an agricultural show more interesting than it sounds and stalls selling everything from Oktoberfest souvenirs to waffles are other worthy diversions When it comes to picking the right Oktoberfest tents there are around large event tents and smaller tents all offering food and beer so itâ s wise to develop a game plan in advance to figure out which tents you will visit and in which order For the most traditional Bavarian beer and music the Augustiner Festhalle may be your best bet while Hacker Festzelt tends to draw a younger and even livelier crowd Meanwhile
