visitor fee at the airport Visitors arriving at Punta Cana International Airport are required to pay a visitor fee prior to going through immigration The fee must be paid in cash only U S dollars are accepted so make sure to hit an ATM stateside before you fly Most businesses accept dollars as payment including tips and excursions Bring small bills so you don t have to break a which could be harder to do Pre book airport transportation If you re not renting a car be sure to reserve your airport to hotel transportation ahead of time This will lower your stress level after passing through customs After retrieving your bags you ll be immediately bombarded by those trying to offer transportation services in exchange for signing you up for a timeshare presentation Rather head straight out the door where you ll find your transportation company rep waiting for you sign in hand with your name on it The airport is relatively close to most resorts typically a to minute drive to the hotel zone Taxis are very expensive so resort transportation is the best way to go Most Punta Cana resorts are all inclusive A majority of the resorts in Punta Cana are all inclusive meaning that travelers pre pay for packages that include accommodations food alcohol and some entertainment There are great deals to be found at various times of the year especially the off season and for many not having to worry about paying for each meal and drink during their vacation is comforting However resort guests should watch for sneaky extra charges for a la carte restaurants certain menu items like lobster or imported alcohol It s not just about the drinking and partying Unfortunately some resorts have a reputation for endless revelry and wild partying even resulting in self induced alcohol poisoning incidents However this paradise offers so much more to the traveler with its pristine white sand beaches crystal clear waters swaying palms and a myriad water sports like snorkeling scuba diving kite surfing parasailing and boating Beyond the beaches Punta Cana offers nature excursions including visits to lagoons waterfalls and ecological reserves The area is also popular with families with
