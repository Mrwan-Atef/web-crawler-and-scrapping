trails were created by America s first Black soldiers Follow in the footsteps of the Buffalo Soldiers who guarded parks and created trails in Yosemite Sequoia and Hawai i Volcanoes National Parks By Ruffin Provost February You may not have heard about the Buffalo Soldiers but they were professional Black enlistees serving in the first segregated regiments of the regular peacetime U S Army formed after the Civil War But you have no doubt benefited from the legacy they left in America s national parks and you may have even traversed the roads and trails they built According to lore these men were nicknamed Buffalo Soldiers by the Plains Indians who fought against them in the late century because their dark curly hair resembled buffalo fur and out of respect for their fierce and stalwart actions in battle Charles Young was the third African American to graduate from West Point He endured hazing social isolation and racial discrimination throughout his years at the military academy After graduation he was with the Ninth U S Cavalry and U S Cavalry the Buffalo Soldiers Photograph by Everett Collection Historical Alamy Stock Photo This is the view across Kings Canyon National Park

Paul Heinrich Alamy Stock Photo These Black soldiers were often assigned difficult and dangerous duties at remote and isolated posts including patrolling and protecting the first national parks in the U S before the National Park Service was established in Buffalo Soldiers were among the first rangers in Yosemite and what is now Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks in California In fact the distinctive four peaked flat hat Park Service rangers wear today is partly modeled after hats worn by Buffalo Soldiers Their work in the parks ranged from fighting wildland fires near what is now Glacier National Park in northwestern Montana to installing telegraph lines near Fort Davis National Historic Site in West Texas to building the Park Service s first arboretum in Yosemite where hundreds of Buffalo Soldiers worked in the early The arboretum is no longer there but Yosemite s Wawona Campground is near its former location The first trail to the summit of Mount Whitney Buffalo Soldiers built a wagon road into the Giant Forest which eventually became Generals Highway through the Sequoia National Forest in California Photograph by Martyn Goddard Alamy Stock Photo A Buffalo Soldier in a five button sack coat poses for a photo in Dakota Territory now North and South Dakota This photo was taken in the Photograph by Glasshouse Images Alamy Stock Photo Driving through the Giant Forest and hiking Mount Whitney are two of the most popular activities in Sequoia National Park both are possible thanks to the Buffalo Soldiers They built a wagon road into the Giant Forest which is the present day automobile route to the site Under the command of Captain Charles Young who was the first Black national park superintendent and was posthumously promoted to brigadier general in Buffalo Soldiers completed the first trail in to the foot summit of Mount Whitney the tallest peak in the contiguous U S Mount Whitney straddles Sequoia National Park and the Inyo National Forest and a hike to the summit requires a wilderness permit with allocations limited by lottery from May through October The mile route from Whitney Portal is the shortest and is usually free of ice and snow from mid July to early October For a shorter easier excursion along a lower portion of the trail that requires no permit drive from Lone Pine Calif along Whitney Portal Road to the trailhead at Whitney Portal The six mile out and back hike to Lone Pine Lake is moderately difficult and turns around at a pristine alpine lake with sweeping views of Mount Whitney The legacy of Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers have historic ties to at least sites in the national park system says Roger Osorio the education outreach coordinator for Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument in Ohio The site at Charles Young s family home honors the acclaimed Army officer and leader and the Buffalo Soldiers Young was the third Black man to graduate from West Point Military Academy and led civilian white laborers working alongside the Buffalo Soldiers on trails roads and other projects in Sequoia It s the same place where the famous soldiers built part of the road now known as the Buffalo Soldiers Scenic Route which leads from Crystal Cave to the Generals Highway and north to the Moro Rock Crescent Meadow Road Sections of this road are closed to trailers and RVs and sometimes closed to all vehicles in winter but they remain open for skiing and snowshoeing Allen Mack an interpretive and education specialist with the Texas Parks Wildlife Department s Buffalo Soldiers Heritage and Outreach Program says the Buffalo Soldiers were skilled military engineers who performed very back breaking work using only hand tools often in miserable and challenging conditions These men were carpenters they were roofers they were brickmasons they were farriers surveyors and the list goes on says Mack Could you imagine wearing a wool uniform in the middle of summer out there busting rock or moving tons of dirt to make a road or a trail They don t get the credit for it that they deserve he says Related These are the most popular national parks Inspired to hike the Mauna Loa Trail Brian K Chappell knows to credit the Buffalo Soldiers for their hard work in the parks and elsewhere His great grandfather Linold Chappell served in the U S Army s regiment a Buffalo Soldier unit that in built the Mauna Loa Trail in Hawai ªi Volcanoes National Park So the younger Chappell decided to hike part of that trail in while on a temporary work assignment in Honolulu It was an emotional connection to be in the outdoors and to know that I was there where he was where he had helped build this trail says Chappell now a retired U S Air Force lieutenant colonel His family has a long and distinguished history of military service Part of the Infantry this uniformed Buffalo Soldier stands for a full length portrait at Fort Custer Montana Photograph by Glasshouse Images Alamy Stock Photo Buffalo Soldiers used sledgehammers to smash lava rock into a flat stable trail leading to the foot Mauna Loa summit in Hawai i Volcanoes National Park Photograph by Photo Resource Hawaii Alamy Stock Photo Mauna Loa has erupted nine times in the century This photo captures the most recent volcanic eruption in December Photograph by Douglas Peebles Photography Alamy Stock Photo Linold Chappell was one of the Buffalo Soldiers who used pound sledgehammers to smash brittle sharp and uneven lava rock formations into a flat stable trail leading to the foot Mauna Loa summit It was pretty rough terrain so I only hiked a portion of it says Chappell It wasn t so much the physical trail itself as it was the connection from knowing that my great grandfather had poured his blood and sweat into this ground The mile hike to the summit is steep and difficult with limited water sources It is usually an overnight trek that requires a backcountry permit Some trail sections are closed due to damage from a eruption so check online for details No permit is required for a day hike on the lower parts of the trail Take Mamalahoa Highway to Mauna Loa Road continuing to Mauna Loa Lookout at the end of the road From there the Mauna Loa Trail follows the path created by the Buffalo Soldiers Bike along a famous Buffalo Soldiers route to Yellowstone Although they didn t build trails in Yellowstone National Park Buffalo Soldiers did make the nearly mile three week round trip excursion to the park from Missoula Mont It was one of the earliest group bicycle trips through the park s geysers rivers and peaks In a group of eight cyclists carried their tools food and other gear crossing the continental divide multiple times They visited most of Yellowstone s major attractions traversing steep dirt roads on single speed bikes Isaiah Gonzalez a doctor from New York City didn t know much about the Buffalo Soldiers until he visited the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum in Houston It s where he learned about their bicycle trip through Yellowstone as part of a project to evaluate bikes for use by cavalry soldiers The Milky Way and winter stars fill the night sky above Half Dome in Yosemite National Park Photograph by Babak Tafreshi Nat Geo Image Collection Yosemite National Park Photograph by Sebastian Lock Laif Redux Portrait of a Buffalo Soldier from the Infantry Regiment Photograph by Alpha Stock Alamy Stock Photo I m a big time mountain biker says Gonzalez who has visited national parks including Yellowstone and Volcanoes Biking on terrain like that with the equipment and the bikes shaking is so tough I can see that was so difficult Gonzalez says learning the history of the Buffalo Soldiers brings him joy because he bikes and runs on these trails Cyclists can explore Yellowstone s paved roads throughout the summer but the shoulders are narrow and traffic can be heavy Consider biking in the spring after roads are plowed but before autos are allowed usually in early April or go biking in the fall after roads close to cars from the first week of November until snow falls After a visit to Yosemite where Teresa Baker learned about the Buffalo Soldiers work there she organized a road trip with participants in retracing by car the route Buffalo Soldiers took to the park on horseback from their winter quarters at The Presidio of San Francisco where more than Buffalo Soldiers are buried Baker an activist working to get more people of color into public lands and better represented in the outdoors industry says It s important to tell these stories so that people understand they already have a relationship with the parks It s just about re establishing those relationships Baker says sharing stories and following in the footsteps of the Buffalo Soldiers by car bike or on foot is a way to help make sure people from all walks of life have access to America s national parks Related Old fashioned images evoke the complicated history of
