Rica on a road trip with these top scenic routes Shutterstock Costa Ricaâ s epic landscapes make it prime road trip territory from its wild Pacific coastline to the relaxed vibe of its Caribbean beaches lush wildlife filled forests and still smoldering volcanoes While most highways are well maintained driving can still be nerve jangling â from bumper to bumper traffic to river crossings and unpredictable drivers everywhere But whether you want to beach hop ride the waves whizz over the rainforest on a zip line or search for sloths nothing beats the freedom of the open road and exploring at your own pace Here are our top picks for the best road trips in Costa Rica San JosÃ to La Fortuna Best road trip for outdoor adventures San JosÃ to La Fortuna miles allow three and a half hours Advertisement You donâ t have to drive far from the urban jungle to come across Costa Ricaâ s wild and wonderful nature And after youâ ve negotiated San JosÃ s traffic the drive is straightforward â a mix of major highways Rte part of the Pan American Highway and curvy paved roads flanked by small towns Once you reach La Fortuna there is no end to the adventures on offer Around miles to the west the postcard perfect cone of Arenal Volcano dominates the landscape of its namesake national park Hike over ancient lava fields or try mountain biking horseback riding and white water rafting Thereâ s windsurfing and kayaking on Lake Arenal too then unwind with a soak in volcanic hot springs Planning tip The roads are quieter mid morning except on weekends when locals travel to La Fortuna to spend time at the hot springs La Fortuna is packed with adventure from hikes to waterfalls and hot springs Nick Fox Shutterstock La Fortuna to Monteverde Best road trip for scenic views La Fortuna to Monteverde miles allow three and a half hours From La Fortuna the scenic route to Monteverde takes you around Lake Arenal on Rte towards Tilaran connecting with Rte where paved road turns to steep winding dirt roads â a is ideal Finally Rte passes small farms and coffee fincas as you climb towards the mist wreathed cloud forest dripping in vegetation and bursting with wildlife On a clear day from a lofty viewpoint you can see both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts from this biodiverse hot spot Birdwatchers and nature lovers will be in their element on awe inspiring day and night hikes and for a monkeyâ s eye view of the forest zip over its canopy at adrenaline inducing speeds with Sky Trek Monteverde Planning tip Fill up at a gas station in La Fortuna Nuevo Arenal or Tilaran thereâ s nothing after that until Monteverde Drake Bay and the Osa Peninsula Best road trip for getting off the beaten path Manuel Antonio National Park to Drake Bay miles allow five hours Advertisement If you hanker after untouched beaches steamy jungle where monkeys and jaguars roam and an adventurous road trip look no further than the far flung Osa Peninsula in Costa Ricaâ s southwestern corner You can fly from San JosÃ to Drake Bay or take a small boat from Sierpe but taking the road less traveled means the chance to spot scarlet macaws scampering squirrel monkeys and other wild things en route You should be confident in a there are multiple rivers to cross â sometimes a passenger will need to get out and test the waters Note that after you turn off Rte at de Osa the roads are unpaved Drake Bay is the jumping off point for snorkeling and scuba diving tours to the underwater playground of the CaÃ o Island marine reserve as well as dolphin and whale spotting trips Or hike the trails of the untamed Corcovado National Park where the tropical lowland forest is home to a wealth of wildlife then kick back in a hammock for some superb sunset watching Detour Break up the journey along Rte at Parque Nacional Marino Ballena where you can spot dolphins migrating humpback whales from December to April and July to November and nesting sea turtles from June to December particularly September and October Drake Bay is an underwater playground near Corcovado National Park Stefan Neumann Shutterstock Guanacaste and the Nicoya Peninsula Best road trip for beach bums Liberia to Santa Teresa miles around six hours but allow a few days for beach hopping For a blissful beach break you canâ t beat the province of Guanacaste where superlative stretches of sand world class surf and spectacular sunsets come standard To get there go west from San JosÃ on Rte or if youâ ve flown into Liberia head south on Rte At the northern end of the Nicoya Peninsula the booming beach town of Tamarindo is a prime spot for water based adventures from surfing to snorkeling and dolphin spotting or bask in the calm waters of Playa SÃ mara where you can kayak across to Isla Chora to snorkel with sea turtles From SÃ mara itâ s a further miles on Rte and Rte to the peninsulaâ s southern tip and the bohemian beach town of Santa Teresa where you can spend your days surfing saluting the sun from a yoga shala and feasting on top notch sushi Planning tip Donâ t be tempted to take the Pacific Coast hugging Rte all the way south it can be treacherous especially in the rainy season The Monkey Trail Best road trip for thrill seekers Playa Hermosa to Potrero Guanacaste miles minutes but allow longer This beach hopping shortcut aka Rte takes you between the sheltered bay of Playa Hermosa and Potrero This curvy mountain pass isnâ t for the fainthearted and offers more adrenaline fuelled fun than the sedate Rte It snakes through a river where the depth of the water can vary wildly â donâ t attempt it in the rainy season without a thereâ s even a Facebook group dedicated to the crossing The muddy track takes you on a roller coaster ride toward the Pacific where youâ ll emerge at the low key town of Potrero where gentle waves lap a dark sand beach perfect for swimming kayaking and SUP Detour If you want more action â on and off the water â the sugar white sand of Playa Flamingo its restaurants and resorts are a minute drive south around a rocky headland Allow extra time in your itinerary for poor road conditions Ron Worobec Top tips for road tripping around Costa Rica To rent a car youâ ll need a valid driving license a passport with a tourist visa stamp and a credit card to cover the excess charges Check the rental agreement s small print and know what your insurance covers Prices rise from mid December to the end of April especially around Christmas New Years and Easter â book vehicles well in advance Highways are well maintained but if you plan to go off road opt for a added cost for rentals Rural roads can be winding potholed and occasionally flooded the rainy season runs from May to November so check conditions before setting out and download an offline map â Waze is most popular Avoid driving long distances after dark especially in the rainy season as lighting and road markings can be in short supply And thanks to poor road conditions inclement weather driving defensively or just stopping to explore journeys often take longer than planned Rental cars are easy to identify so donâ t leave your possessions on view and take everything out overnight If possible park in a guarded parking lot rather than on the street Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Costa Rica Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started
