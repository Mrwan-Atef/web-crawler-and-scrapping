Want to learn how to ski Let an Olympian teach you TRAVEL Want to learn how to ski Let an Olympian teach you Training camps led by big names in the world of winter sports have been gaining in popularity Here are a few places where you can learn from the best Club Med in Tignes France offers a weeklong ski camp with Olympians Photograph by Club Med By Abigail Butcher November This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK The sight of one of Britain s greatest ever skiers bombing over the brow of the hill in a classic racing tuck will remain chiselled into my memory for years to come Was that Chemmy Alcott asks one of a group of skiers who pulls up beside us stopped in their tracks by the very distinctive sight of the blonde haired Olympian and presenter of the BBC s Ski Sunday rounding the practise gates I generally eschew celebrity culture but it s hard not to feel total awe while watching the four time Olympic skier on a racecourse even just a small one piste side in Tignes I m here as part of a residency Chemmy is hosting at Club Med Tignes This week long ski camp offers the chance for regular skiers like me to pick up tips from an inspirational pro And for anyone wondering Chemmy s inimitable presenting skills transfer to real life she s the same in person as she is on screen brimming with energy enthusiasm knowledge insight and fun I have a healthy relationship with fear she d said to me earlier as we tucked into a nutritious breakfast of eggs and salad from the buffet protein and antioxidants after beginning the day with a yoga session in the gym People need to push themselves out of their comfort zone we re all coasting in life working at she continues Personal growth is choosing to go beyond that opening yourself up to phenomenal success but also risks and mistakes I never lose I either win or I learn And win Chemmy did She raced in four consecutive Winter Olympic Games at Salt Lake City Turin Vancouver and Sochi and in seven FIS World Championships She has won gold medals during the course of her career and was at one time the eighth ranked skier in the world Despite breaking bones in her body including shattering her right leg Chemmy has overcome life changing injuries to continue racing When she retired in March she was the only British female skier to have won a World Cup run My catchphrase is no falls no balls she says as I move on to baguettes croissants and jam we are in France after all and the buffet is a sight to behold wannabe athletes or not Whether you re a beginner or a pro if you re not falling you re not learning Club Med runs residencies with top level athletes throughout the year to showcase its facilities and according to UK managing director Nicolas Bresch create once in a lifetime experiences for guests Previous star hosts during winter include the likes of Graham Bell Billy Morgan Jenny Jones Aimee Fuller and Jamie Nichols Chemmy Alcott leads a ski camp as Club Med s resident Winter Olympian Photograph by Club Med Skiing with big names has been gaining traction in the world of winter sports holidays Top level athletes are often paid by companies to host special weeks on the snow from legendary ski jumper Eddie the eagle Edwards and former England rugby international Mike Tindall to GB ski racer Konrad Bartelski And Chemmy who as well as keeping us busy before we hit the slopes with yoga and talking us through an athlete s menu at mealtimes hosts various ski clinics We cover carving racing and off piste skiing as well as taking spa visits and trips into Tignes to explore the market not to mention some apres ski fun While she obviously knows skiing Chemmy made great suggestions like tubing in the village with our year old daughter says Clara Tonks from Bristol who took part in the camp with her husband Steve Which isn t something we d have known about Her whole approach was about being enthusiastic open and willing to give her time to help us Expert insight no doubt pays dividends During the course of my work as a ski writer I ve been lucky to have slope time with some incredible athletes from one off runs with Freeride World Tour skiers to the Ski with the Superstars camp run by Chris Davenport in Portillo Chile every August I find the love a top athlete has for their sport generally improves the way I learn and it s not just the slope time Conversations over breakfast on the chairlift and in the apres ski bar offer fascinating insights into what makes these people tick not to mention the great pro tips And this week with Clemmy in Tignes is no exception I ve been trying to improve the fluidity of my left turns for years A series of injuries to my left side and the fact that I m right handed and therefore right dominant means I skid my turns to the left Even going through my instructor exams a few years back didn t entirely solve the problem which has been exacerbated by more injuries I arrived in Tignes intent on sorting it out Think about putting grapes in your ankle joints Chemmy suggests to me then making Bordeaux with those grapes Keep the pressure all the way around the turn hip in front of your knees It sounds like basic stuff and initially I m frustrated because the sliding doesn t stop But Chemmy has created a very non judgemental atmosphere and eventually after videoing my technique which no one has done for years things finally start to click For Carla and Steve it was the same BBC Ski Sunday presenter Graham Bell is just one of the famous faces who have attended the City Ski Championships in Switzerland Photograph by Jonathan Stewart It was brilliant to have this sort of instruction time especially during the race clinic when there was no right or wrong just room to experiment says Carla The video feedback was amazing you can really see what position your body is in and what you re doing And it was almost playful trying out new things and seeing how they feel Chemmy gives us all permission to experiment and understands people learn in different ways We begin the week with some freeriding just to the side of the piste keeping the pitch manageable and staying within sight of the lifts reduced the fear factor that can come with a big off piste adventure An ESF French Ski School instructor qualified to lead a group off piste accompanied us checking conditions and planning the routes But we soon graduate to more adventurous terrain skiing off piste into the Valley Perdue The Lost Valley in Val d Is√®re and taking a fun run through a ravine to the side of the village of La Daille which I d never skied despite countless visits to the area We end the final day s skiing with some mid afternoon dancing at the legendary La Folie Douce mountain bar restaurant As I set off wearily for home Chemmy having rounded up the group to ensure we were in time for the last lift she surprises me once more I like it when people get frustrated she says in response to my annoyance at taking so many years to rectify the slide on my turns We fear a loss of control particularly on skis but it s about trusting yourself and your ability to be free To be part of someone s eureka moment is such an honour such a privilege With that she clicks into her bindings and hops off effortlessly for the last run home over a mogul studded piste no sign of weariness whatsoever And I follow her physically tired but mentally uplifted Chemmy s enthusiasm really is infectious How to do it A week s stay at Club Med Tignes costs from per person all inclusive full board accommodation return flights from London transfers ski lift pass ESF ski lessons and activities In select residency weeks time with a top level athlete is also included free of charge to guests Chemmy Alcott also runs race and
