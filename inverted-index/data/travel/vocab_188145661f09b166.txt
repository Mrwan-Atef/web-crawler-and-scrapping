everyday Cuban life Think rocking chairs on the porch a bottle of rum on the dresser a front room full of family heirlooms the clip clop of horsesâ hooves in the street outside and the animated conversations over breakfast that always seem to end with the words â no es fÃ cilâ it ainâ t easy Local tip Casas particulares in places like Havana and ViÃ ales are positively palatial while others remain refreshingly down to earth All of them offer an uncensored view of Cuba that no hotel could ever replicate Cubaâ s national bird the blue white and red tocororo bears the colors of the countryâ s flag Tarpan Shutterstock Go birdwatching Aside from crocodiles Cubaâ s fauna doesnâ t make much of impression â except for its abundance of birdlife that is Approximately avian species inhabit the

ebullient festivals Through war austerity rationing and hardship Cubans have retained their infectious joie de vivre Even during the darkest days of the Special Period following the demise of Cubaâ s ally and patron the USSR the feisty festivals never stopped â a testament to the countryâ s capacity to put politics aside and get on with the important business of living Planning tip The best shows

homes in Trinidad Cuba displays its multifaceted culture through its architecture Shutterstock Admire Cubaâ s eclectic architecture Often spectacular yet rarely constant Cuban architecture retains certain binding threads a definable cubanidad â Cuban nessâ that is always recognizable Many of the countryâ s older buildings were built with the sugar fortunes derived from the brutal enforced labor of enslaved Afro Cubans These structures provide an uncomfortable testimony to Cubaâ s multifaceted culture and sometimes difficult past More recent architecture displays a melody of influences from French classicism to hints of art deco and art nouveau Planning tip Visit the UNESCO listed cities of Havana Trinidad Cienfuegos and and pick out the details Dive in the Caribbean Sea There will be objections no doubt but letâ s say it anyway Cuba has the best diving in the Caribbean The reasons Unrivaled water clarity virgin reefs and sheltered Caribbean waters that teem with exotic fish

visitors Punta FrancÃ s on Isla de la Juventud â known for its underwater photography â reigns supreme Rich coral reefs caves and wrecked ships are among the submerged wonders near the shores of Guardalavaca Beach in HolguÃ n Expect to hear live music at every turn in Cuba one of the world s most musically diverse nations Shutterstock Soak up Cubaâ s live music scene Welcome to one of the most musically diverse countries on the planet where melodious guitars always win out over background tracks and singing is seen as just another form of verbal communication If youâ ve been in Cuba for more than a day and still havenâ t heard any live music youâ re clearly hanging out in the wrong places The traditional genres are merely one groove on a larger record â and indeed Cuba has been pushing the musical envelope for decades From Benny MorÃ to X Alfonso cities like Havana and Santiago de Cuba have spawned talent that continues to enchant the world Unlock the secrets of Matanzas For too long travelers have overlooked the city of Matanzas on their way to the all inclusive resorts of nearby Varadero But things are gradually changing Amid the bridges and rivers of this once great cultural city flickers of its erstwhile beauty are starting to reemerge in revived classical music venues a refurbished theater and a cutting edge art street decorated with chin scratching sculptures Varadero may have the beaches but Matanzasâ gigantic historical legacy will teach you more about the real Cuba than dozens of repeat visits to the resorts See traces of Cubaâ s revolutionary history and spirit at sites across the country Felix Lipov Shutterstock Understand Cubaâ s revolutionary heritage An improbable escape from a shipwrecked leisure yacht and a classic David vs Goliath struggle that was won convincingly by the extreme underdogs the details of Cubaâ s revolution might have been pulled from a barely believable movie script Yet it all happened right here â and just to prove it you can visit the revolutionary sites in person In nearly years since the invasion little has changed at the disembarkation of the Granma yacht and Fidel Castroâ s wartime HQ at mountaintop Comandancia de la Plata For a glimpse of the guerrillasâ weaponry and anecdotes visit Museo de la in Havana or Cuartel Moncada in Santiago de Cuba Feel the rhythm of in Santiago de Cuba There s nothing quite as transcendent as the hypnotic beat of the SanterÃ a drums summoning up the spirits of the orishas deities But while most Afro Cuban religious rites are only for initiates the drumming and dances of Cubaâ s traditional Latin American dance troupes are open to all Formed in the to keep the African culture of Cuba alive groups enjoy strong government patronage and their energetic and colorful shows in Santiago de Cuba remain spontaneous and true to their roots The architecture of Trinidad is perfectly preserved Julian Peters Photography Shutterstock Step back in time in Trinidad The regional city of Trinidad all but went to sleep in â and never really woke up This strange twist of fate is good news for modern travelers who can roam freely through the perfectly preserved mid century sugar town like voyeurs from another era Though itâ s no secret these days the time warped streets still have the power to enchant with their grand colonial homestays easily accessible countryside and exciting live music scene But this is also a real working town with all the foibles and fun of century Cuba Cycle through Valle de ViÃ ales With less traffic on the roads than Britain Cuba is ideal for cycling and thereâ s no better place to do it than the bucolic Valle de ViÃ ales The valley offers all the ingredients of a tropical Tour de France craggy mogotes limestone monoliths impossibly green tobacco fields ambling oxen and spirit lifting viewpoints at every turn Planning tip The terrain is relatively flat â and your biggest dilemma if you can procure a decent bike that is will be where to stop for your sunset toasting mojito Pico Turquino in the Sierra Maestra is Cuba s highest mountain Losa Shutterstock Hike Pico Turquino The trek up Pico Turquino Cubaâ s highest mountain is a mixture of endurance sport nature tour and fascinating history lesson Guides are mandatory whether you choose an intense one day round trip route or an also tough two to three day mile

trip to Fidelâ s wartime jungle HQ La Plata on the way up Experience the next wave of Cuban culture at FÃ brica de Arte Cubano Welcome to the â newâ Cuba And no â itâ s not a casino or golf course or

of Getting lost is a savvy recommendation for any traveler passing through the city of tinajones clay pots churches and erstwhile pirates Always keen to be different has a street grid that deviates from almost every other Spanish colonial city in Latin America Its lanes are as labyrinthine as a Moroccan medina hiding Catholic churches triangular plazas and a growing ensemble of smart boutique hotels occupying restored colonial buildings Tuck into Cubaâ s evolving food scene Ever since new privatization laws lifted the lid off Cubaâ s creative pressure cooker in a culinary revolution has been in full swing A country that once offered little more than rice and beans has rediscovered its gastronomic mojo with a profusion of new restaurants experimenting with spices fusion and â perhaps best of all â a welcome reevaluation of its own national cuisine Planning tip Havana leads the culinary field in number and variety of eating establishments yet thereâ s plenty of regional diversity
