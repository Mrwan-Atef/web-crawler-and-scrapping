The Moroccan oyster destination you ve never heard of Oualidia Plucked from the tidal lagoon Oualidia s oysters are best served raw Photograph by Michael Hanson Getty Images TRAVEL The Moroccan oyster destination you ve never heard of Fresh oysters wetland birdwatching and lazy beach days make the little known community of Oualidia a charming alternative to Essaouira on Morocco s Atlantic coast By Lorna Parkes October This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Des huîtres Des huîtres The tanned salesman calling to me in French is holding a knife in one hand and a gnarled oyster in the other beckoning me over for a taste It s a breezy June day and I m at a row of whitewashed shacks by the beachside corniche in Oualidia a town on Morocco s Atlantic coast Each is topped by a Majorelle blue canopy shading its display of huîtres oysters giant sea snails cockles and clams all arranged within borders of fat lemons and small bottles of Tabasco sauce Unbeknown to many Morocco has a blossoming oyster industry and the community of Oualidia on the west coast is very proud of its premier export The town is a warren of sleepy streets flowing down to seafood cafes and a beachside surf shack that hires out boards But what makes it special is the tidal lagoon where the molluscs in front of me will have been plucked that morning I can see it beyond the beach stretching northwards sea fret hanging over the water Protected from the Atlantic waves by a sand bank that hides the sea the wetland reserve is home to seven oyster farms plus thousands of birds Its waters are so valuable that it s recognised as a site of international importance by the intergovernmental Ramsar Convention on Wetlands There are two famous places for oysters in Morocco Dakhla and Oualidia explains my guide Nabil El Bahri when we motor out in a small boat to get a closer look the next day The ones in Oualidia are more delicious and great to eat straight from the water he adds Nabil dressed head to toe in khaki like a pro twitcher knows what he s talking about before working here he regularly came on childhood holidays to visit his grandmother Oualidia is a popular summer destination for Moroccans where birdwatching safaris ferry visitors along the protected lagoon Photography by La Sultana Although few international travellers make it to Oualidia around miles north of Essaouira it has a long history as a summer destination for Moroccans As we sail past spears of wood protruding from the lagoon each one marking the location of an underwater oyster bed I m keeping one eye on an entertaining flotilla of brightly decorated boats ferrying kids and women in hijabs over to a long beach on the coastal side of the lagoon Pedalos and kayaks pass us some with waving children Smoke from makeshift grills on the sand dissipates into the sea air the atmosphere is jubilant Sailing further the beach goers thin out replaced by simple white buildings used for cleaning the oysters and neat rows of traps forming fishy fences at the front of each property Some have tables and chairs outside to tempt water borne visitors in for shucking marathons I soon realise we re not the only ones checking out the glassy lagoon s natural larder As we move into its upper reaches we see a grey heron and spoonbills wading in a reed bed low flying terns and coots whose feet slap against the water as they take off The temperature of the water and food is good for the birds There are worms fish and shrimp for them explains Nabil as we pull up with a bump to clamber ashore Having travelled about six miles to the furthest reaches of the lagoon Nabil is on a mission to find us Oualidia s most colourful inhabitants flamingos Passing fields of wheat and corn we pick out a narrow path through a springy carpet of samphire and magenta coloured sea grasses to cross a series of abandoned salt pans And there they are a single file procession of tall bubble gum pink bodies in the shallows As we watch them stalk through the reeds Nabil explains Oualidia is a favoured hangout for the birds on their journey from Spain to Senegal We know this because they re all tagged we log the numbers when we see them He s full of facts my favourite being that flamingos trademark rosy hue is down to their preferred diet of shrimps Eyes glued to binoculars Nabil pauses to check on them They re in good health Their colour is just fantastic he whispers The next morning over breakfast at the lagoon side La Sultana Oualidia hotel I see another leggy resident wading through the waters a local clam collector taking advantage of the low tide They re in good company with snowy white egrets digging among the collage of seaweed draped rock pools I m eager for one more glide as soon as the tide allows but this time I opt for the hotel s kayak A lagoon side retreat the suites at La Sultana Oualida feature private terraces overlooking calm waters Photograph by La Sultana With the absence of a boat s motor there s nothing to drown out the roar of the sea ever present but invisible from lagoon level Drawn to the fierce sound I pull up on the beach opposite the hotel clambering past discarded oyster shells from yesterday s picnics up to a pockmarked rocky plateau to find it The waves below are huge frothy and angry looking a direct contrast to the lagoon behind me which has bubbled into a handful of tranquil islands with the receding waters a haven for oysters farmers birds and anyone lucky enough to find this place How to do it Oualidia is a drive from both Marrakech and Casablanca La Sultana Oualidia has suites a pontoon bar pool and restaurant From a night This story was created with the support of La Sultana Published in the October issue of National Geographic
