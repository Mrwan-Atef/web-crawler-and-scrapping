find some of Europe s best kept coastal secrets Sitting between Nice and Monaco Plage Mala s white sands offer a quieter escape in the heart of the French Riviera Photograph by Getty Images By Hannah Wild July This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK With glistening crystalline waters and sweeping expanses of volcanic black sand Europe s coastline is incredibly diverse From the rugged cliffs of the Amalfi Coast to the white Mediterranean sands of the Balearics it s no wonder these destinations are visited by millions of sun seeking travellers every year Yet beyond the tourist hotspots lie thousands of miles of undiscovered stretches of coast just waiting to be discovered by those willing to go further Spanning from the North Sea to the Black Sea here s where you can find the best of Europe s lesser known beaches without a seaside resort in sight Lokrum Island Croatia A minute boat ride from Dubrovnik s Old Town port Lokrum Island serves as a secluded retreat away from the often crowded streets of the popular Croatian city Protected by UNESCO as a special reserve of forest vegetation you ll find more pine trees and peacocks living wild on the island than people A world away from the bustling streets of Dubrovnik Lokrum Island is home to native wildlife and quiet coves perfect for swimming Photograph by Getty Images Swimming spots can be found across the entirety of the island however a saltwater lagoon formed by tectonic shifts and erosion known as Mrtvo More Dead Sea is arguably one of the best Fed by an underwater passage connecting to the Adriatic Sea Mrtvo More is an enclosed body of water sunken deep into the ground Sheltered by the jagged rock faces that surround the lagoon the water here is entirely still making for ideal swimming conditions Sunbathe on the flat rock formations before diving into the crystal clear waters but keep an eye out for friendly peacocks who might try and steal your lunch Burnham Overy Staithe England To experience Norfolk s vast blue skies in all their glory head to the hidden oasis of Burnham Overy Staithe beach on the North Norfolk Coast While its seclusion means embarking on a mile long walk through English countryside to reach the coast the unobstructed views of yellow golden sands and rockpools make the final clamber over the sand dunes all worth it Aside from the occasional sunken pool of seawater left from the retreating tide the beach itself is entirely flat with nothing but endless grains of sand Reaching Burnham Overy Staithe beach involves a mile long walk along the Norfolk Coast Path Photograph by Andrew Michael Getty Images Park at Burnham Overy Staithe harbour an area popular for sailing paddle boarding and kayaking before heading along the raised sandy banks of the Norfolk Coast Path that traces this wild coastline Without a single cafe or ice cream stall in sight it might feel a little isolated but that s part of its charm How to spend a weekend in North Norfolk UK Mirror Beach Albania Travel around the southern Albanian coast and you re bound to find isolated pockets of white sand and crystal clear waters but Mirror Beach is arguably the best Named after how the sunlight reflects on the sea here this area of untouched coastline remains such a secret you ll struggle to find many people here even in the summer months The landscape is defined by a combination of soft white sand and shingle that guides you to the clean dazzling waters of the Adriatic Sea The nearest village Ksamil is nearly four miles away and there s a small car park near the entrance to the beach And while securing a space here requires hiring an umbrella the private intimate and crowd free spots make the fee worthwhile Riva Bianca Italy Known pretty much only to those living within the medieval town of Lierna on the eastern shore of northern Italy s Lake Como this lakeside hideout remains visited by mostly local families Backed by the lush vegetation clad mountains surrounding Lake Como Riva Bianca has less than a mile of shoreline but don t let that put you off Overlooked by Castello di Lierna an ancient defensive castle Riva Bianca is an incredibly scenic spot while excellent pizza and gelato spots in Lierna are perfect for a quintessential Italian meal You ll need swim shoes due to the small white pebbles the beach is named after but it s worth it for a dip in the clean calm waters A guide to Lake Como s highlights Veleka Beach Bulgaria Set against the backdrop of Strandzha mountains just seven miles from the Turkish border Veleka is named after the river that flows into the Black Sea While the beach typically extends for just less than a mile providing ample space for sunbathing either by the river or seaside the width depends on the action of the river that year and the volume of water trickling down from the mountains At the Veleka Beach visitors can swim in the Black Sea on one side and the Veleka river on the other Take advantage of the river s calm waters by trying your hand at paddleboarding with the local windsurfing school before kicking back under one of the free umbrellas available at the beach entrance While this spot is known to locals facilities are limited Arrive with enough refreshments and SPF to see you through a day under the blazing Bulgarian sun Plage Mala France Among the glitz and glamour of Nice Monaco and Saint Tropez lies Plage Mala A small inlet of land tucked into a cove this beach is the ultimate secret hidden in the towering cliff faces of the French Riviera coast With white sands and clear blue waters this crescent shaped bay has the same beauty as the more popular beaches of the French Riviera but on a quieter scale Access to the beach is limited however it can be reached by either the coastal path along the Cap d Ail shore or the steps of Allée Mala found near Cap d Ail train station With turqouise water and steep cliffs Plage Mala is well suited to those keen to try cliff jumping be mindful of the safe swimming area reserved for those who prefer to save their energy for the long ascent back up the cliff To subscribe to National Geographic Traveller UK magazine click here
