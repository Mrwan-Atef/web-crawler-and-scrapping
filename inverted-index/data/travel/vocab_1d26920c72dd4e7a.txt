Why the student gap year is more popular than ever Recent years have seen an evolution of the gap year from a period of partying to time spent reflecting and volunteering Photograph by Sophie Dover Getty Images TRAVEL The student gap year is evolving and travel with purpose is more popular than ever From enhancing a CV to benefitting a local community or travelling with purpose the motives for students to take a gap year are increasingly nuanced By Ben Clatworthy June This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK For decades the gap year recipe remained virtually unchanged cheap hostels all night parties banana pancakes and months spent finding yourself Throw in some bungee jumping quad biking and moped riding along with days doing not very much and you quickly paint the stereotypical picture of the fabled year out of old The gap year travellers of today though are far more likely to be found doing sunrise yoga on a beach before a day of volunteering Evenings are less about getting blind drunk and more about sitting around a campfire herbal tea bubbling away on a stove discussing the day s work Once synonymous with those taking a break between A levels and university or after a degree the gap year has evolved into a catch all that includes anyone seeking an escape before joining the workforce And according to Student Universe the world s largest youth travel agency the post pandemic era has seen the biggest shift in students desire and motivation to travel in years While pure leisure fly and flop adventure tours and festivals still has a place in the market the prevailing trend among gap year students is for educational or vocational trips Their main goal is to do something ethical and responsible says Milly Whitehead co founder of specialist gap year travel company The Leap We ve seen a huge growth in the demand for volunteering programmes and trips that have a proper structured itinerary They re so much more discerning and into the fine detail of what a trip will involve than what we ve seen in the past The aim really is for a year out to add something to the future value of their CV and their UCAS Universities and Colleges Admissions Service form It is a stark change from even a decade ago Whitehead says when most gap year travellers were happy flitting about until the kitty dried up and it was time to fly home Her assessment is consistent with the findings of The State of Student and Youth Travel in the latest annual report by Student Universe It surveyed members of Generation Z generally defined as those born between the mid and the late in the UK US Canada and Australia to assess their motives for travel Reports show that a large majority of Gen Z believe embarking on a gap year will boost their job prospects back home Photograph by Luis Alvarez Getty Images It suggested would embark on a trip with the main intention being that the experience would make them more employable It s a theme that runs through the report around believed vocational travel would improve their employability while said they d sign up to volunteer on a project related to their ideal future career path Jemma Gore Booth says about half her year group at Emanuel School in southwest London decided to take a gap year before going to university Taking a gap year was common she says Of my nine closest friends five travelled I worked as a teaching assistant in London to build up funds and then started with a month in Sri Lanka volunteering as an English teacher before travelling to Thailand and Vietnam When Gore Booth set off for her year abroad in there were still strict Covid protocols in place especially in Asia and the looming threat of further restrictions Such risks she says still made it a more attractive proposition than online learning plus she d always intended to take a year out I really didn t want to do any of my university degree online but I was also nervous about the travel situation she says Gore Booth is far from alone Latest figures reveal that a record number of British teenagers who studied for GCSE and A levels through the pandemic opted to take a gap year before starting further education Figures from UCAS released last summer when A level results were published showed more than students applied to defer their place for a year an increase of almost compared to the previous year Jump around One of the biggest shifts Whitehead has seen in the years since she and her husband Guy founded The Leap is the pace at which people want to travel It really needs to be pacy to keep everybody focused and energised she says Heaven knows how we kept people entertained for eight weeks back in the day It was more go and teach in a school in the morning maybe do something else in the afternoon but all much slower That just doesn t wash now These days she adds it has to be bang bang bang a variety of projects a variety of adventures Every day has to be different Experiences offered by The Leap include volunteering with organisations such as Oceans Alive Trust a non profit organisation that works to halt coral loss and boost fish stocks beach cleaning in Costa Rica or assisting with a community reforestation project in Barichara Columbia Most programmes average about five weeks and include language learning alongside training in a skill such as diving The demand for more structured programmes is a trend that Student Universe is also adapting to That desire of younger travellers to think I ll get on a flight and see where life takes me has shifted somewhat says Sam Willan vice president of global marketing Maybe it was blissful ignorance but now our travellers definitely want to feel more looked after Willan says the company has also seen a gradual move towards young people taking several shorter trips over the course of a gap year as opposed to one long adventure These typically follow a similar pattern a learning holiday a working or volunteering trip and then travelling Southeast Asian countries are becoming less popular destinations for gap year travellers in favour of Central and South America Photograph by Dmitry Rukhlenko Getty Images It all comes down to career development again he says There s a real drive among gappers to end up with experiences that will bolster their CV while building themselves as culturally aware well rounded individuals When participants in the The State of Student and Youth Travel in were asked what appeals to you about taking a vacation partying and clubbing came bottom with just of the respondents selecting it Top of the list was sightseeing and city activities followed by experiencing different cultures and relaxing and rejuvenating According to Willan gap year operators are also reporting subtle shifts in the countries gappers are choosing with former staples in Southeast Asia notably Laos Thailand and Vietnam losing some of their lustre and the likes of India South Africa Brazil and Peru on the rise Whitehead reports a similar trend with destinations that were among the first to lift Covid border restrictions benefitting from a rise in student travellers Central and South America were the first to reopen after the pandemic and really started the drumbeat she says What we ve seen is that as more students have travelled there in recent years word of mouth has followed through year groups There s a feeling they offer more contrast geographically than Southeast Asia Take Peru you can be in the Andes one day on the Amazon the next and on Rainbow Mountain the day after For working trips Australia New Zealand and Canada are the standout thanks in part to their Commonwealth status which opens doors to young travellers from the UK according to Jenza a travel agency specialising in working holidays Last year the UK signed agreements with all three countries to expand the Youth Mobility Scheme visa increasing the age limit from to and the maximum length of stays from two to three years Working holidays are more accessible to today s youth as they break down what s undoubtedly the biggest barrier to entry money says Lucy Lynch at Jenza Options for students today are however more limited than they were Villa staff chalet boys and girls resort reps childminders and sailing instructors were the mainstay of British package holidays and extremely popular gap year jobs until Brexit The UK s departure from the EU cut off the ability for young people in the country to easily work overseas and reduced the number of services available to holidaymakers A recent report by trade bodies ABTA and Seasonal Businesses in Travel SBiT revealed the number of Britons fulfilling tourism roles overseas has fallen from in to just in This SBiT says has a disproportionately greater effect on young people who ve traditionally filled such seasonal jobs working for holiday companies in a year off say or during the summer break It s also had a huge impact on chalet holidays beloved of British skiers which relied heavily on gap year staff who were happy to work for less money in return for bed board and a lift pass for the season Charles Owen managing director of SBiT says It s proving tremendously difficult to employ the UK staff we need to run our businesses in the EU In some countries it s a mountain of complex paperwork delays and extra costs that need to be overcome in others there isn t really a workable route ABTA is calling for an enhanced seasonal mobility agreement between the UK and EU for tourism workers as current arrangements apply only to certain roles and limit stays to days It s also calling on the UK government to work to extend the Youth Mobility Scheme to the EU There s nothing stopping us doing this says Luke Petherbridge director of public affairs at ABTA It is mutually beneficial not least for the individuals who take part in the scheme and get to live and work overseas Critically it s not part of the wider immigration regime The mobility scheme doesn t confer any longer term rights to remain for those that have taken part Many people in the travel sector are hoping that a change in government will pave the way for a closer relationship with the EU and forge a route for young Britons to work in the bloc without expensive bureaucratic hurdles which most travel companies can t afford SBiT estimates the cost of recruiting a young person from the UK for seasonal work in France the most popular ski destination for the UK has risen by One of the biggest decisions gap year students face is how to fund their overseas adventure Research by recruitment agency Teaching Abroad found that one in five young people rely on parents to help pay for a year abroad Others however are more self reliant Minnie Fisher is currently on a five month trip taking in New Zealand Australia and Southeast Asia She s paid for the trip by working from last summer until leaving in January this year It was hard work but worth it she says from Nusa Penida an Indonesian island near Bali After finishing my A levels last year I worked pretty much full time in a local cafe and I also did lots of babysitting too I saved up in all We used for flights and I left with in the bank although I really want to end the trip with at least left over Gore Booth is also planning another year out once she finishes her degree at Newcastle University No matter what it would have to involve some element of earning money she says I d also want it to contribute in some way to my CV and future work I m thinking I ll do a TEFL Teaching English as a Foreign Language course and then go teach English somewhere like Vietnam I think that would be a brilliant experience Published in the
