Share The colours of Antananarivo on full display mihtiander Getty Images Antananarivo the tongue twisting capital of Madagascar is often overlooked by travellers which is an opportunity missed Yes itâ s a busy ramshackle sort of place where traffic is a problem and security is taken seriously but look beyond this and youâ ll find a colourful city full of charm history and incredible views at every turn There are palaces museums and streets lined with faded colonial architecture to explore bustling markets and boutiques to peruse and a contemporary dining scene to enjoy Delve into the history of Antananarivo As the home of the Merina Madagascarâ s largest and most powerful ethnic group Tana as itâ s affectionately known has featured heavily in the country s evolution since its founding in the early century Its journey to become the capital of the first unified Kingdom of Madagascar in was an arduous one with numerous tribal wars and the continual redrawing of boundaries By the time the French arrived on the scene in Tananarive as it was then known had long been a major city After independence in the city started to swell further and the growing pains associated with its increasing population culminated in political unrest in It still faces huge challenges â corruption and the lingering political uncertainty â that continue to hold it back much to the frustration of its people Today the city remains the seat of power where international organisations businesses and money mingle making it unlike anywhere else in Madagascar It stands out for its relative if isolated areas of wealth and cosmopolitan facilities and is very much the heart of the action on the island Advertisement The main gate of the Rova of Antananarivo aka the Queen s Palace Yann Guichaoua Photos Lonely Planet Historic sights You couldnâ t miss the century Rova of Antananarivo palace complex if you tried Constructed at the city s highest point it towers above Antananarivo and stands in stark contrast to the more modest neighbourhoods that cling to the hillside below Buildings at the Rova have come and gone since the early Sadly many of the original wooden structures that had survived from the century were destroyed by a devastating fire in Thankfully the imposing stone building erected by Scottish missionary James Cameron in remains intact Your compulsory guide will set the city in context and give a good introduction to Antananarivoâ s history The story continues at the nearby Andafiavaratra Palace where the small museum showcases select artefacts and paintings depicting Merina rule many of which were rescued from the fire You can then dig a little deeper at the MusÃ e dâ Art et dâ ArchÃ ologie This free museum details archaeological sites around Madagascar and showcases ancient finds Imported Christianity has played a significant role in shaping society not only in Antananarivo but also in Madagascar as a whole As such churches are found all over the city â itâ s said there are more than of varying persuasions shapes and sizes Stop by Andohalo Cathedral to see one of the leading Gothic style places of worship Standing at the gates of the former French consulate youâ d be forgiven for forgetting where you were This unmistakably French chateau was renamed Ambohitsorohitra Palace and is now used as official offices You canâ t enter but itâ s worth an eyeball on a walk through town Advertisement A drive through the outskirts of northern Antananarivo will take you to the Royal Hill of Ambohimanga the countryâ s only cultural Unesco site and a place of great significance It includes the ruins of a fortified royal city as well as a burial site and it remains an important place of pilgrimage for the people of Madagascar The menus available in Antananarivo offer a wide selection of international food including Japanese sushi Denis Gateau Getty Images Sample the islandâ s finest cosmopolitan cuisine Madagascar isnâ t exactly known for its haute cuisine yet Antananarivo stands in splendid isolation for its delectable selection of restaurants and vibrant dining scene â it s a welcome surprise to many visitors Thereâ s a delicious blend of Madagascan hospitality and European flair where French staples mingle with Indonesian and African flavours The unexpected joys of baked camembert creamy tartiflette and nasi goreng Indonesian stir fried rice with vegetables and meat make eating out a pleasure while dishes using local spices such as vanilla chicken and zebu steak with Madagascan peppercorn give you a taste of something more local Antananarivo is without doubt a treat for foodies Start the day with breakfast and strong coffee at CafÃ de la Gare a vintage European affair located by the tracks in Gare Soarano the old railway station Lunchtime calls for a stop at the bamboo enveloped terrace of Le Buffet du Jardin for a crispy pizza and an ice cold THB locally brewed â Three Horse Beerâ Dinner offers the chance to sample even more of the capitalâ s gastronomy â go for authentic Spanish tapas on the terrace at the Grand Hotel Urban the generous portions and lively atmosphere at Le Saka book in advance or the zebu and raclette at La Ribaudiere Not ready for bed Pop by no comment bar for some live music and cocktails Shop the markets and artisan boutiques of Antananarivo When it comes to shopping in Antananarivo practicality and style trumps tourist tat In place of imported magnets and plastic fantastic ornaments is a sophisticated selection of locally produced handicrafts textiles oils and spices â if you know where to look For an elbows out experience head to Analakely Market to rake through piles of essentials from secondhand clothes to knock off trainers Meanwhile Village Artisanal d Andohalo on the edge of Jardin dâ Andohalo sells a variety of crafts from woven table mats to jewellery Back in Antananarivoâ s once upon a time railway station stylish French owned boutique Ivahona is a real shopping highlight Itâ s stocked with plenty of gifts and chic souvenirs including homewares scented soaps Madagascan vanilla of course clothing and accessories Ã picerie Fine La Ferme de Morarano is the place to purchase your Madagascan consumables Whether youâ re after organic ylang ylang oil spices or beauty products youâ ll find it here Keep an eye out for â Gallery Openâ signs as many independent studios and galleries such as Roses Baobab can be found around Antananarivo selling local art and sculptures Antananarivo spreads out below â the views from the top of town are worth the hike up to the Rova Â Patrick Lanto Randriamanampisoa Take in exceptional views Antananarivo sprawls over two main hillsides which can make walking around the historic part of the city a bit of a challenge on the legs but fear not the repetitive thigh burn is worth it From the Rova the cityâ s sights are spread out in front of you including pretty Lac Anosy a WWI memorial and the much loved Mahamasina Stadium where all sorts of public events are held You also get a sense of how Antananarivoâ s notorious traffic snakes its way through neighbourhoods which give way to suburban rice paddies dotted with smoking kilns endlessly firing bricks A self guided walking tour is the best way to get to grips with the main sights and promises rewarding glimpses in every direction Head for the oh so French area of Haute Ville which demands exploration on foot thanks to its crumbling colonial architecture and multiple viewpoints A ring tailed lemur one of Madagascar s most famous animal icons Gennaro Leonardi EyeEm Getty Images Experience natural attractions For next level viewing pleasure time your visit to Antananarivo with the colourful jacaranda season typically late October into November Jacaranda trees line many of the French conceived boulevards across Tana and seeing these beauties in bloom is a delight adding bursts of purple to the cityâ s slopes parks and streets Before venturing out into the wilds of Madagascar where unique wildlife roams check out Lemursâ Park This private reserve some km west of Antananarivo makes for a memorable day trip getting you up close with nine different species most of which wander freely around the gardens It doesnâ t pitch itself as a zoo but rather as a conservation centre working to educate people about Madagascarâ s leading primates Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address Subscribe now Subscribe to Lonely Planet newsletters and
