Barbara Woolsey Aug min read Share Learn all about SpÃ ti culture in Berlin and how you can get involved Â Hinterhaus Productions Getty Images In some cities theyâ re called convenience stores in others bodegas but in Berlin those pint sized late night shops you see everywhere are SpÃ ti and theyâ re integral to the cityâ s everyday life Advertisement SpÃ tis short for SpÃ tkauf in German â late night purchaseâ are tiny independently owned retailers selling snacks alcohol and beverages tobacco and so on As the name suggests they are open â til the wee hours sometimes long after supermarkets shut This makes SpÃ tis a centerpiece of big nights out in Berlin a place for pre drinking before clubs and bars late night snacks and picking up beers en route to the afterparty Some of my fondest memories as a decade long Berliner are on SpÃ ti stoops whether swigging cheap wine outside during the pandemic or the more recent unforgettable experience of DJing at a SpÃ ti rave before the police came of course Here is everything you need to know about Berlin SpÃ ti culture History SpÃ tis are not just for the party crowd â these neighborhood spots are integral to Berlinersâ everyday lives Itâ s where us locals pick up parcels pack picnics and meet friends The key to understanding their importance lies in the cityâ s past The emergence of SpÃ tis can be traced back to the Cold War and SpÃ tverkaufsstellen â late shopping outletsâ in East German cities like East Berlin Leipzig and Dresden These privately owned shops catered to shift workers outside the standard hours of state owned retailers Later the term became synonymous with Berlinâ s fast paced all hours nightlife and anti capitalist subculture In a city so creative and culturally rich but economically poor SpÃ tis have long been energetic hotspots and entertaining places for students musicians and artists to mingle with ease Today SpÃ ti is a term that is culturally unique and Berlin specific Nowhere is the term quite so colloquial and important to the vernacular In fact elsewhere in Germany convenience stores go by other names such as Trinkhalle or kiosk Advertisement The SpÃ ti stores are a perfect example of the freewheeling spirit of Berlin Â Barbara Woolsey SpÃ tis represent the cityâ s free spirit SpÃ tis are the essence of Berlinâ s urban culture They exemplify the cityâ s spontaneous spunky and often hedonistic nature tempting passersby with a cold Wegbier a beer to drink on the way somewhere on every corner Once a symbol of old school Berlin SpÃ tis are deftly modernizing Gone are the days of SpÃ ti internet cafÃ s an unbelievable anecdote â in serial killer Luka Magnotta was caught in a one when its owner recognized him Googling himself And while a recent law dictated that SpÃ tis must stay closed on Sundays and public holidays some live on the wild side such as my former corner store which had a Sunday street lookout watching for authorities Typically teeny double aisle shops are becoming bigger and flashier New so called â super SpÃ tis â stocking pricey imported snacks and CBD infused everything are a byproduct of the cityâ s increasing gentrification and hipsterism as are pop ups like Germanyâ s first sober SpÃ ti selling alcohol free wine and gin Overall SpÃ tis exemplify the cityâ s everlasting drive to create vibrant communities against a strong foundation of individualism Locals happily support these small businesses run by owners and their families And in multicultural neighborhoods like NeukÃ lln and Kreuzberg they are meeting points for Turkish and Arab communities promoting visibility through food and cultural wares Exactly here is where SpÃ ti culture adds charm to Berlin This is no Kwik E Mart chain â each shop is unique Aesthetics and state of upkeep vary wildly and phone numbers and opening hours on Google are rarely correct And in Germanyâ s capital where the local culture is defined by gruff formality and small talk overrated itâ s neighborhood haunts like these which supply at least a little community togetherness Now you try The most talked about SpÃ tis here are usually fighting gentrification possess memorable dÃ cor or kooky products and in typical Berlin fashion throw the best parties But if you ask me the best SpÃ ti experience isnâ t one you look for itâ s the random hole in the wall you stumble upon The markers of a good SpÃ ti are a street facing bench for people watching and more people hanging out Itâ s a cooler that works and a bottle opener that hasnâ t been stolen from the cash register Itâ s about the joy of simplicity cheap fun and low expectations And in its best most purest form itâ s a heavenly place not too far off in the distance where thirst can be quenched â even at an ungodly hour And for a next level adventure go to a SpÃ ti rave A party where DJs speakers and sweaty bodies do their best not to knock over gum racks is quite simply good times Theyâ re last minute rarely promoted and well illegal thank you German bureaucracy adding to the allure The best time to see SpÃ ti raves in full swing is on the May Day public holiday when Kreuzbergâ s streets are chock full of them From October to April the collective ear sight hosts parties at a changing lineup of SpÃ tis and neighborhood haunts like Volkanâ s Party SpÃ ti and SpÃ tkauf also double their sales floors for dancing Finding yourself at an impromptu SpÃ ti rave could end up as one of the best nights you ever have Â Barbara Woolsey Take it with you Keep that SpÃ ti feeling going strong by taking a selection of late night bad decision weird German snacks home with you chips flavored like peanuts paprika and bacon are hot contenders as well as Haribo gummies of infinite colors and shapes and salty licorice if youâ re nasty My favorite SpÃ ti impulse bottles of Berliner Luft in German â Berlin Airâ are always popular with out of towners â itâ s a tasty peppermint schnapps akin to mouthwash but much better Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address Subscribe now Subscribe to Lonely Planet
