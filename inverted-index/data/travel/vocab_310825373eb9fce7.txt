Why diversity in travel matters A young American tourist who is an generation descendant of slaves looks out to sea from Fort William in Ghana a launching point for the Atlantic slave trade Photograph by Jane Hahn TRAVEL TRAVELER What I ve learned as a black traveler Here s why diverse perspectives make for better stories By Heather Greenwood Davis September min read This year hundreds of African Americans will board flights to Ghana For many it will be their first trip to the African continent They ll be answering a call issued by the West African country to come home The ship believed to have carried the first enslaved Africans to what would become the United States of America set sail from Ghana Four hundred years later African Americans are yearning to understand better what and who was left behind Ghana has declared as The Year of Return Learn about the last American slave ship discovered in Alabama I m not an African American but as a black woman living in North America I understand the attraction of the invitation It s no small thing to find a place in the world that wants to tell your story Travelers walk to Fort William during a trip in Anomabo Ghana to explore a landmark of the colonial slave trade Photograph by Jane Hahn The New York Times Redux My history has always been impacted by race and travel My parents emigrated from Jamaica to Canada in the My childhood included annual trips to spots across Canada the U S and the Caribbean Each time we ventured beyond our neighborhood my parents intentionally or not drove home the idea that the world was mine to explore My memories of travel focused on what I was seeing not on how I was being seen Warm welcomes were a luxury I took for granted Visit these destinations for African American history and culture As I got older I realized that for many before me including my parents that had not been the case As children they hadn t had the opportunities to travel that I was being afforded And when as adults they did venture out their kids in tow and far from their black majority homeland they were often met with prejudices I was too young to recognize Years later my own travels around the world as a journalist helped me understand that the color of my skin is an integral part of my experience The stories I write don t have to be overtly centered on race to share my perspectives as a racialized person Being a black traveler means that during a reporting stint in Ghana in my a local leader could single me out to share how much I look like a member of a nearby tribe It means that in Ethiopia Rwanda England and Northern Canada I am called sister and treated as such by people who can find a connection in my skin color It can also lead to experiences that are jarring and to opportunities that provoke conversation In China and India my hair and skin have stopped curious crowds Read what it s like to travel while black in China Developing a more inclusive travel perspective requires no sacrifice It isn t a charitable act all travelers benefit when the fullest possible stories are told Showcasing our similarities allows for the possibility of challenging stereotypes that go beyond travel we swim we ski we hike I embrace all of these opportunities and the platforms that have allowed me to tell my stories because I recognize that there aren t enough people who look like me who get the chance And that s a problem When voices are missing from the mainstream narrative their absence is normalized After more than years as a travel writer I still struggle to find other black storytellers in mainstream outlets This despite a report that African American travelers who make up about percent of the U S population spend around billion a year on travel Many who have grown used to being an afterthought to prevailing conversations have carved out spaces of their own It s how you get a Green Book the printed annual handbook that until its last issue in detailed the places that were safe for black road trippers to stop eat sleep or stay out past dark Take a Green Book inspired road trip through Alabama s civil rights history It s what leads to the creation of Evita Robinson s Nomadness Travel Tribe a lifestyle brand and community with a membership of travelers of color Or Outdoor Afro founded by National Geographic Fellow Rue Mapp which aims to reconnect African Americans with nature It s why Karen Akpan s Black Kids Do Travel Facebook group exists as a safe space for parents of color to share their travel triumphs and concerns And although both Kellee Edwards and Oneika Raymond head up Travel Channel productions the list of people of color as the face of any TV program in the industry is short Seeing and reading about people who look like us impacts how we travel because in those stories is the recognition that our lives the accomplishments hardships history and culture matter But the stories of African American travelers are essential for other reasons too When mainstream travel pieces speak about safety people of color know that we ll still need to save our questions about our particular fears for the direct messages of black friends and colleagues Yes I know the place is safe but is it safe for me It s a system not unlike the ones friends in the LGBTQ community have developed See the best destinations for LGBTQ families And so when I take my kids two black boys into the world I do so with all of these questions opportunities and responsibilities in mind We have traveled to dozens of countries together snapping family photos in front of the Eiffel Tower the pyramids of Giza the Great Wall of China and Niagara Falls I take them to places where their skin color is a fascination and to places where everyone looks like them I ve forced them into the travel narrative because they have every right to be there but I also do it because I know that other families of color read our stories and in our photos see the possibilities available for themselves More diverse voices are needed but you don t have to be a minority traveler to make a difference Developing a more inclusive travel perspective requires no sacrifice It isn t a charitable act all travelers benefit when the fullest possible stories are told And when we aren t getting the full narrative we are all robbed of facts and experiences that could prove transformational in the way we see the world Related unique traditions around the world of Spain Each summer thousands of people on horseback and foot flock to southern Spain a celebration of Pentecost called the Pilgrimage of Rocío Photograph by José Antonio Zamora National Geographic YourShot Tourists travel providers outlets and agents need only recognize the potential for tunnel vision and ask themselves whether there are perspectives missing in what we are reading and watching And then make every effort to seek them out As you consume travel ask yourself On whom is the camera focused Whose story is absent from the historical tour And those of us with a platform be it blog social media TV show or magazine must offer more opportunities for people of color to hold the pen the microphone and the camera Inclusion is a recognition that the whole story with its flaws and complexities is far more beautiful than its individual pieces Travel makes us better and multiple travel perspectives make us better still Heather Greenwood Davis is a family travel expert and a contributing editor of National Geographic Traveler magazine Follow her on Twitter This story originally
