bring the crowds but it s the best time to hit the beach in Costa Rica Costa Rica s beautiful beaches wildlife packed cloud rainforests and sky scraping mountains attract entranced visitors from all over the globe The pura vida pure life spirit fills every corner of this magical country and the locals take their commitment to preserving it very seriously With the average temperature hovering around there s really no bad time to visit this Central American paradise But if you want to get the most out of your trip and have specific activities on your must do list timing is everything Here s what you need to know about choosing the best time to visit Costa Rica December to April is the best time for beach vacations If your main goal is to spend time in the sun visit during Costa Rica s dry season which runs from December to about mid April Every day will bring clear skies and enough sun to enjoy the beach along the Caribbean and Pacific coastlines Lower rainfall means itâ s arguably the best time to visit in general and also more attractive for travelers hoping to see wildlife However this is the high season â the most expensive time to visit â so expect higher prices for accommodation and airfare It will also be more crowded particularly around the major holidays of Christmas the New Year and Easter March is also very popular for travelers on spring break The best way to stay connected Saily provides a hassle free solution to travel data â just choose your data plan and prepare for your trip When you get to your destination you can go online right away Get your eSIM Seeing VolcÃ n Arenal is one of the top things to do in Costa Rica Stock Photos Shutterstock May and June are the best times to avoid crowds May is the beginning of the green season â meaning you can expect mornings full of sunshine but rain later in the day Itâ s when much of Costa Ricaâ s plant life comes into bloom This period can be slightly unpredictable when it comes to rainfall because itâ s between the dry and rainy seasons However if you want to experience most of the more popular sites without large crowds this is the best time to visit Itâ s also a great time to get a clear view of VolcÃ n Arenal Keep in mind the end of June will begin to see more crowds as the summer travel season starts for many Americans Green sea turtles are a special animal to spot in Tortuguero National Park Shutterstock July and August are the best times for spotting wildlife July and August are still within the countryâ s green season so you can expect the same weather as in May and June Itâ s also the perfect time for whale watching in Dominical or spotting sea turtles in Tortuguero National Park Trails roads and paths may be muddy and slippery at this time of year so bear that in mind if youâ re interested in exploring off the beaten track Prices for certain attractions and activities may be higher due to the influx of travelers coming for summer break September and October are the best times for budget travelers September and October see the departure of summer travelers and the arrival of holiday travelers Youâ ll find fewer crowds and more deals on accommodation and travel to Costa Rica This makes it the best time for those wanting to explore the country without big crowds and higher prices however itâ s also the height of the rainy season so weather wise itâ s the least desirable time to visit This time is not ideal for those looking to see more remote places due to the possibility of flooding Pavones on Costa Rica s Pacific coast is popular with surfers philippus Shutterstock August to November is the best time for surfers Great surf is one of the main draws of Costa Ricaâ s Pacific coast and August through November is when you will see many of the biggest waves thanks to storm surges brought on by the rainy season While conditions may be ideal for experienced surfers you can also expect moderate rainfall Novemberâ s weather tends to be unpredictable too so bear that in mind if you are planning outdoor activities as part of your trip Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Costa Rica Let a local expert craft
