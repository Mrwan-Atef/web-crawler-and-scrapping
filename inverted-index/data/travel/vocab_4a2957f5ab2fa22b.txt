Share One of the worldâ s most fabled wine regions the Douro Valley is easily accessible iStock One of the worldâ s most fabled wine regions Portugal â s Douro Valley is perfection in a bottle Yet you donâ t need to drink a drop to savor the sweeping scenery along the snaking Rio Douro Steeply terraced vineyards that climb mountainsides seasonal cherry and almond blossoms rejuvenating hotels in vine hemmed quintas wine estates prehistoric rock art and an acclaimed food scene ensure this is one of Portugalâ s best destinations for non drinking travelers and wine aficionados alike The course taken by the Rio Douro consists of three sub regions â the Baixo Corgo Cima Corgo and Douo Superior the first two being easiest to access and most popular with first time visitors â before spilling out into the Atlantic Ocean in Porto which loaned its name to the regionâ s signature wine and shipped it to connoisseurs around the world Advertisement Have questions about where to figuratively and literally start on your Douro Valley journey Hereâ s how to plan the perfect first visit Early spring in the Douro Valley can be on the cold and wet side â yet does offer moments of beauty Shutterstock When should I go to the Douro Valley Unlike along Portugalâ s northern coast summer isnâ t the go to answer The temperatures inland can become uncomfortably hot in the warmest months especially east around arid Vila Nova de Foz CÃ a still even the warmest summer days are ripe for lazy wine tastings On the other extreme cold and downpours set in between November and February â yet Foz CÃ a witnesses pretty almond blossoms in late February And riding the rails to relish the landscape is a joy year round The ideal time to visit is spring or autumn The latter is especially magical from late September into October thanks to lively grape harvest celebrations or vindimas as the landscape shifts from green to a carpet of crimson copper and gold Springâ s calling cards Resendeâ s cherry blossoms usually late March into April and blissful hikes Whenever you come a mid week stay will be more relaxing How much time should I spend in the Douro Valley Itâ s easy to visit the Douro Valley on a day trip from Porto squeezing in spectacular scenery wine sampling and a hearty lunch around one or both of the most popular towns Peso da RÃ gua and PinhÃ o If thatâ s all the time you have you wonâ t be disappointed especially as the journey is panoramic by rail or river Staying the night will elevate your experience to no end â especially if you check in at a quinta â as the streets quiet for the night and the valley returns to its natural stillness Plan at least a three night stay to immerse yourself in the valleyâ s varied terrain and to take detours from the Rio Douro This will give you time to venture to Lamego â s staircase topping sacred sanctuary seek out scenic miradouros panoramic viewpoints and if youâ ve rented a car stop at some of the more intimate wine making settlements like Favaios or Provesende Not in a hurry Spend a week on the road to string together all the big hitters followed by prehistoric cave art offbeat trails surveyed by birds of prey and hearing Portugalâ s co official second language on the Rio Douroâ s frontier with Spain Thereâ s no more scenic way to reach the Douro Valley from Porto than by train Armando Oliveira Getty Images Is it easy to get in and around the Douro Valley Getting to the Baixo Corgo and Cima Corgo is straightforward and outlandishly scenic no matter how you do it The nearest international airport is Porto from Portugalâ s second city you can rent a car cruise the river upstream on a full day return voyage or arrive by rail Traveling by train to the main river towns along the Linha do Douro is affordable and beyond Barqueiros roughly where the Douro Valley begins incredibly scenic thanks to the expansive openable windows of the cute vintage carriages The journey from Porto to PinhÃ o takes hours add an extra hour to reach end of the line Pocinho Special services are scheduled seasonally including the Historical Train and the pricey gourmand geared Presidential Train Rede Expressos operates coaches from Porto to Lamego direct and Foz CÃ a change in Viseu Getting around the rural villages and eastern depths of the Douro Valley can be challenging without a car Still itâ s usually possible with patience planning and Rodonorte â s local bus services Advertisement Yet having your own car does bring its rewards The and boast some of Portugalâ s showiest stretches of road and youâ ll cross countless miradouros as you approach the valley from above Of course the downside to winery hopping by road is youâ ll need a designated driver Top things to do in the Douro Valley Learn all about demarcation and the history of port at the Museu do Douro With panoramas like this itâ s almost criminal to stay inside Still I always suggest starting at Peso da RÃ guaâ s Museu do Douro The clear colorful and engaging exhibitions here in an century building where regulators once administered the worldâ s oldest demarcated wine region set the Douro scene For a couple of euros more you can round off the visit with a glass of port in the upstairs tasting room bar with river framing views Visit the Douro Valley for the fall harvest and you may get the chance to prepare the grapes the traditional way with your own bare feet David Sawyer Getty images Go tasting touring or trampling With your homework concluded itâ s time to get tasting Many Douro Valley wineries offer enotourism wine tourism experiences ranging from simple sips and vineyard tours or picnics to autumnâ s vindimas activities â including traditional treading of the grapes by foot â and year round bottling and blending master classes led by winemakers Vintage ports are always a highlight of any winery visit here â yet award winning reds whites and rosÃ s from the plus cultivated grape varieties in the Douro DOC Controlled Denomination of Origin have become more prevalent since the century Quinta do Bomfim part of the fifth generation Symington estate that produces Dowâ s and Cockburnâ s ports â is a short distance from PinhÃ oâ s train station Tastings are slick and scrumptious here especially if followed by lunch on the riverview terrace of Bomfim helmed by Pedro Lemos one of Portugalâ s most celebrated chefs In RÃ gua the Quinta do Vallado team has been hard at work since â a tradition you can experience through delicious daily tastings or pre bookable workshops Stray further afield and youâ ll stumble upon numerous adegas cellars with more rural small batch wineries often affording the most wholesome experience Cruising the Douro in a traditional wooden rabelo provides a delightful way to take in the glorious scenery Heracles Kritikos Shutterstock Meander along the magnificent Rio Douro by rabelo The enabler of viticulture and a previously critical port shipping route the Rio Douro is the valleyâ s star â and getting out on this gorgeous river is practically a Portuguese rite of passage From Porto full day upstream return cruises depart from Vila Nova de Gaia just across from Porto via the Dom LuÃ s I Bridge and usually include lunch onboard passage through several locks and a wine town visit Taking the train in and returning downstream on a one way sailing is also possible For a more intimate encounter with this natural wonder board a rabelo boat in Tua RÃ gua or PinhÃ o for a one to two hour trip These traditional wooden vessels were historically used to transport barrels to Vila Nova de Gaiaâ s port houses Magnifico Douro â s solar adapted boat provides even more subdued sailings than the standard crafts You can also pick up a kayak from their office on PinhÃ o pier for a slower self paced stint on the waters Youâ ll feel a sense of accomplishment after climbing the hundreds of stairs leading to SantuÃ rio Nossa Senhora dos RemÃ dios in Lamego Kerry Murray for Lonely Planet Snack on cured ham and climb some serious stairs in Lamego With their stellar river views PinhÃ o and Peso da RÃ gua tend to get most of the attention of Douro Valley travelers â yet Lamego is arguably the Douro Valleyâ s most impressive settlement Dominating the city is an almost herculean sculpture embellished staircase leading to the century SantuÃ rio de Nossa Senhora dos RemÃ dios Count each step as you go and youâ ll reach as you arrive at the twin towered church Once back down reward yourself with a platter of the cityâ s outstanding presunto cured ham on the terrace of A Presunteca If you fancy a taste of something other than port opt for a sparkling wine from the neighboring TÃ vora Varosa wine region before touring the palatial Museu de Lamego Explore to the east for paleolithic rock art and offbeat experiences Most first time visitors donâ t venture to the eastern end of the Douro Superior But those who do are rewarded with more intimate wineries a taste of local life and the phenomenal prehistoric rock art of Foz CÃ a The excellent Museu do CÃ a tells the story of the thousands of etchings of animals some more than years old found on the valleyâ s rocks The museumâ s cafeâ s miradouro overlooking the confluence of the Douro and CÃ a Rivers is one of my favorite coffee with a view spots in the country To see the ancient rock face artwork which is protected and closed off book a guided tour of the Parque do Vale do CÃ a in advance Trace the Rio Douro north â now forming the border with Spain â towards TrÃ s os Montes beyond Barca de Alva the valley becomes the vulture swooped Parque Natural do Douro Internacional Eventually youâ ll twist into Miranda do Douro an isolated and time honored frontier town where MirandÃªs Portugalâ s co official second language is still spoken My favorite thing to do in the Douro Valley I love slowing down and spending a few nights in a river view quinta Savoring the stillness of the moonlight bathed Rio Douro and vines from a bedroom balcony â an on site produced port in hand of course â is a highlight of my many indelible Portugal memories As most quintas are working wine estates any stay is also an excellent opportunity for in depth conversations with the farmers and vintners that produce the wines as you stroll from the vines to the panoramic pool I particularly love the traditional renovated schist workersâ cottages at Quinta de Ventozelo which also has a small museum swoon worthy pools and farm to table restaurant Arriving on a rabelo transfer from PinhÃ o all add to the magic There are quirkier options too â like Quinta da Pacheca where you can sleep in a giant wine barrel Tastings of vintage port and Michelin starred dining can quickly add up in the Douro Valley yet with some planning you donâ t have to splurge to enjoy its pleasures Kerry Murray for Lonely Planet How much money do I need for the Douro Valley Though splurge worthy experiences quickly add up the Douro Valley can be surprisingly fair priced for such a famous wine region If you take the train to RÃ gua opt for a hike picnic and Douro Museum ticket with a three wine tasting included a DIY day trip can cost as little as â US For the same sum you can usually secure a double room in a local guesthouse mid week in the off season which is worth considering as there are no savings in buying a same day round trip train ticket Of course prices quickly soar if you splash out on a boutique quinta stay vintage only wine tour or Michelin recommended restaurants â though tascas family run restaurants can keep dining affordable as they mainly cater to locals Carry cash if you plan to use public transport eat in rural restaurants or buy drinks or bottles onboard certain boats or from smaller wineries Basic room for two from â US Self catering apartment including Airbnb â US Double room in a river view quinta from â US One way train ticket from Porto to Pocinho â US One hour rabelo trip from â US Museu do Douro ticket â US A glass of wine in a low key bar â US Winery tasting and tour from â US Typical tasca lunch for two â US Upscale tasting menu with without wine pairing from â US per person Hiring a guide can get you access to smaller vineyards not open to the general public Kerry Murray for Lonely Planet Should I get a guide in the Douro Valley Arranging a DIY visit to the Douro is easy â but hiring a private guide can be a worthy investment Some have special arrangements with wineries making for easier access to smaller vineyards including those that sell to the big producers This is especially true if you hire a driver guide Is the Douro Valley family friendly As in all of Portugal children are made to feel welcome just about everywhere in the Douro Valley While some wineries have minimum age requirements others offer family friendly activities including Monverde where children can taste and blend juices as parents work the grapes Boat tours are usually half price for under and free for toddlers Can I swim in the Douro Absolutely Portugalâ s Atlantic Ocean beaches arenâ t the only place to take a dip Inland youâ ll find plenty of praias fluviais river beaches including sandy swimming spots in Porto Rei Lomba and Praia do Castelo Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Portugal Let a local expert craft your
