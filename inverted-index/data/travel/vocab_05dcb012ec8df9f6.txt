traveling to Puglia Italy Benedetta Geddo Apr min read Share Traditional trulli in Alberobello Paradise at risk Shutterstock Once an underappreciated gem Puglia is now on the radar of eager tourists who come to explore the intriguing places across this region stretching down to the heel of Italy s boot though it is still less visited by foreign visitors than other coastal areas of the country From the splendid beaches of the Gargano and Salento peninsulas to history filled cities like Bari Lecce and Taranto and picturesque towns like Ostuni embrace the rhythm of local life in Puglia whether that s taking an afternoon nap deploying a few simple phrases in Italian or knowing just where to buy a train ticket Advertisement These travel tips will make your visit to Puglia as breezy as a seaside perch above the Ionian Sea Allow more than a few days Youâ ll need more than a few days to truly see all of Puglia s most incredible sights It is quite a long region and driving from its northernmost point to its southernmost tip takes around five hours To make the most of your time plan to stay in a couple of different bases so you can reduce your travel time between destinations Two weeks will give you ample time to enjoy both getting lost in historic town centers and sprawling on a beach under the sun Vieste Marcin Krzyzak Shutterstock Summer is amazing but the shoulder season is better If you want to experience a true Italian summer then July and August are the months to do that It doesnâ t get much more summery than this but youâ ll have to share towns and beaches with quite a lot of fellow tourists Since itâ s the high season prices shoot up too as does the temperature which can become difficult to manage if youâ re walking around cities filled with stone buildings that reflect their heat on you The best times to visit Puglia are its shoulder seasons so mid to late spring and then September until mid October The weather is milder but still lovely enough to take a dip in the sea and there arenâ t as many crowds â especially in September when most Italians have returned to their everyday lives of work and school It s possible to get around by train While renting a car remains the best option to get around Puglia at your own pace and with all the flexibility that making your own schedule allows you can still reach major cities by train And when it comes to trains the Trenitalia app is an absolute must have Relatively easy to navigate the app tells you everything there is to know about routes schedules and prices You can also buy tickets through the app so you can skip any potential lines at ticket offices or bypass the problem of there not being a ticket office altogether Advertisement Look beyond ticket offices Ticket offices might not be that easy to find especially when it comes to buses or train stations in smaller towns In that case look around for a tabaccheria tobacco shop or edicola newsstand where you can usually purchase tickets â and avoid the possible additional fees of buying them on board a bus or train Abbazia di San Vito in Apulia LauraVl Shutterstock Be mindful of road signs Having your own car may be the easiest way to explore but beware of the risk of fines When in bigger cities look out for ZTLs Limited Traffic Zones Entering a ZTL might land you with a pretty considerable fine that is sure to put a damper on your vacation Check street signs carefully entrances to ZTLs will usually be marked with a white sign that has a red circle and the phrase â Zona a traffico limitato â in black Make summer bookings in advance During the high season booking in advance is recommended for everything especially at the beach clubs or lido on the coast of Puglia While you can definitely find free beaches where all you have to do is lay down your towel and plant your umbrella if you want to partake of the amenities of a lido â like beach chairs changing rooms a bar sometimes even small soccer pitches and beach volleyball courts â itâ s better if you reserve your spot well in advance Salento GoneWithTheWind Shutterstock Leave swimwear by the water Even if youâ re in a coastal town with the most magnificent beach youâ ve ever seen swimwear should only be worn when youâ re actually on the beach Several towns have regulations against wearing swimwear when strolling around their centers and itâ s generally something that Italians simply donâ t do â just throw on a dress or shirt to cover up and youâ re good to go Do not disturb during the pennica Thereâ s only one solution to beating the high summer heat sleeping through the hottest hours of the day This is a sacred moment for locals in Puglia and in Italy more broadly The pennica afternoon nap can happen anywhere from midday to about and you shouldnâ t be surprised to see shops and others activities close during those hours and reopen later in the afternoon Thatâ s just the rhythm of life in Puglia so take it in stride and nap away Bone up on some basic Italian While the staff at your hotel or hostel or a restaurant in a major city in Puglia will probably know some English the same isnâ t true for the people you might encounter in a small village by the road Learning some basic sentences in Italian is a good way to make sure youâ re not completely cut off from locals around you should the need arise and itâ s a generally appreciated courtesy that immediately puts the people youâ re talking with in a good mood Greet people with buongiorno good morning or buonasera good evening Instead of please and thank you say per favore and grazie To ask about a price say quanto costa and to find the nearest bathroom ask dovâ Ã il bagno To make your way back to English explain that you donâ t speak Italian well Non parlo bene italiano and ask if the other person can talk to you in English Parli inglese or Parla inglese to be polite Perfect your greetings You may notice that Italians often exchange two kisses on the cheek as a hello While that is usually reserved for friends and relatives â you wonâ t be expected to do the same with someone you just met â thereâ s definitely an etiquette to keep in mind It is considered polite to greet people when entering a shop especially if itâ s a smaller one or a restaurant with a quick buongiorno or buonasera which will always be well received and likely reciprocated

payments cash might be appreciated in smaller towns and villages Keep a small amount of euros in cash in case the cafe where youâ re eating or a souvenir vendor doesnâ t take cards Take common sense safety precautions Donâ t believe the rumors that say it is not safe to travel to Puglia This stereotype â with some foundation in truth but not as extreme as you might have been led to believe â lingers in the south of Italy Use the same common sense you would when traveling anywhere and be especially aware of pickpockets If you have a car donâ t leave anything of value that can be seen through the windows Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Italy Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers Everywhere Follow us
