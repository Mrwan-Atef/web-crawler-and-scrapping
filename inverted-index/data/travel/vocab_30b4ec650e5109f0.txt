exciting new ways to explore iconic destinations eBooks Download instantly and read any time Explore all products Travel Stories Pakistan Share things you need to know before traveling to Pakistan Bradley Mayhew Sep min read Share Pakistan offers amazing adventures but it pays to read up on the challenges Â Dave Primov Shutterstock Pakistan is one of the worldâ s great surprises with an incredible diversity of scenery â from the worldâ s biggest mountain glaciers to the sparkling waters of the Indus River â alongside some of the most beautiful forts mosques and archaeological sites in the Subcontinent It is the cultural bridge between India and Central Asia and home to some of the most hospitable people youâ ll ever meet It would however be fair to say that Pakistan has a mixed reputation beyond its borders The country is beset with economic political and security problems but much has changed security wise in recent years An incredible welcome is guaranteed here but this is also a destination that requires a bit of research in order to travel with confidence Start your planning with the following essential travel tips Choose the right season for the areas you are visiting Travel in Pakistan is strongly affected by the seasons The summer months of July and August are the best time to visit the high mountains of the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges in the north but this is also the busiest time for domestic tourism and itâ s incredibly hot elsewhere in the country If you want to explore the center south and west of the country consider a visit in spring April and May or autumn October and November especially if you donâ t plan on going trekking October brings fabulous fall colors to places like the Hunza Valley whereas winter November to February is the best time to explore central and southern Pakistan Advertisement Festivals worth planning your trip around include the Shandur Polo Festival in the second weekend of July held atop the mountain pass between Hunza and Chitral and the Chilam Joshi spring festival in the Kalash Valley in mid May Youâ ll probably need a visa and letter of invitation to visit Pakistan Most foreigners need a visa to enter Pakistan but you can apply online through the immigration departmentâ s slightly glitchy e visa system You will also need a letter of invitation from a local hotel your Pakistani host or a Pakistani travel agent to secure a visa so give yourself enough time to get this document in place Even if you don t plan on taking a tour travel agencies can provide a letter of invitation for a fee Contact your local Pakistani embassy or high commission for the latest information Be prepared for some challenges if you travel during Ramadan The Muslim fasting month of Ramadan brings a specific set of challenges for travelers Most Pakistani Muslims avoid eating or drinking between dawn and dusk during this holy month and most restaurants close during the day with offices often working reduced hours Youâ ll need to be fairly self sufficient when it comes to food during daylight hours and you should avoid eating in public during the fasting period This said evenings are especially lively during Ramadan as the devout break their daily fast with blowouts in local restaurants The dates for Ramadan shift annually according to the Islamic lunar calendar and sightings of the moon and the festival moves forward by days each year relative to the Gregorian calendar in the festival should start around March Religion influences many things in Pakistan from social interactions to the architecture Â Tahir Mahmood Shutterstock Get a Pakistani SIM card to use the local taxi apps Public Wi Fi is not all that common outside of larger cities in Pakistan so itâ s useful to bring an unlocked smartphone for mobile browsing Buy a local SIM card from the main customer service center for your chosen operator in whichever town you happen to be in Travelers recommend Zong Telenor or Jazz for central Pakistan or the government owned SCOM for the mountainous northern area of Gilgit Baltistan With a local SIM and phone number you should be able to use local taxi apps such as Uber and its local equivalent Careem which will save you both time and money compared to flagging down local taxis in big cities such as Islamabad and Lahore Bring plenty of photocopies of your passport There are lots of checkpoints in Pakistan where you ll need to show your identity documents so bring lots of photocopies of your passportâ s information pages and Pakistan visa and always travel with the original passport on your person Youâ ll find yourself handing over these copies regularly on long distance road trips including when traveling on the Karakoram Highway Enjoy the local hospitality but donâ t abuse it Culture and customs can vary widely as you move from region to region in Pakistan but in general youâ ll find most Pakistanis to be extremely friendly and hospitable Conversations cups of chai and even dinner invitations flow easily and you can expect to participate in hundreds of selfies Advertisement Hospitality is so integral to Pakistani culture that many locals feel obliged to offer to pay for a foreignerâ s meal or bus tickets even if money is short You may have to turn down these invitations multiple times to avoid burdening anyone unnecessarily If you do share a meal in Pakistan be sure to pass and accept food with your right hand only the left hand should not be used for eating or shaking hands Traveling in Pakistan as a solo woman can be challenging but rewarding Â Skazzjy Getty Images iStockphoto Women travelers might face some challenges in Pakistan For the most part Pakistan is a conservative male dominated society and this can pose some challenges for female travelers Women and men donâ t mix much in public and women generally sit in segregated areas on public buses and trains and often in restaurants Attitudes towards foreign women can be protective and curious but women traveling alone may face some suspicion and sexual harassment can sometimes be a risk in crowds Special rules for women also apply at some religious sites For solo women travelers traveling through Pakistan it helps to already have some experience of travel in other Islamic countries Women traveling with a male companion generally face fewer obstacles On the plus side women travelers can gain insights into family dynamics and the lives of Pakistani women which are completely off limits to male travelers And in some situations foreign women may have unique access to both the male and female worlds Invest in a shalwar kameez to travel like a local Pakistanâ s national dress is the shalwar kameez a garnet resembling a long shirt worn over wide baggy trousers popular with both men and women It s worth investing in a set if you are going to be traveling for any length of time in Pakistan The shalwar kameez is supremely practical and comfortable in this climate â youâ ll also blend in nicely with the crowd and locals will respect you for sharing in their culture Women should also add a dupatta scarf to cover their hair when visiting mosques and other religious sites Dial down public displays of affection Many Pakistanis are socially conservative and public displays of affection between men and women â including kissing touching and even holding hands in public â are frowned on Attitudes towards LGBTIQ people can also be quite negative and same sex relationships are illegal so Pakistan is not a good place for openly LGBTIQ people to travel It is not unusual for Pakistani men to hold hands or drape arms around each other but this is generally platonic Treat bargaining as a lighthearted sport Haggling is acceptable commonplace and often necessary in Pakistan but it is best approached as a lighthearted social exchange rather than a life or death struggle as some travelers treat it when traveling in Asia The goal is for both purchaser and seller to walk away happy When bargaining respond to the first price quoted with a lower offer then work back and forth until you reach a price you can both agree on If you can afford it avoid haggling over small sums â local people are often poorly paid and financially insecure and overpaying by a few rupees wonâ t make a big dent in your wallet Official permission is required to visit some parts of the country Â Agha Waseem Ahmed Stocksy United Be aware of the no go areas The security situation can vary widely as you travel around Pakistan Potentially dicey areas include parts of rural Sindh some neighborhoods in Karachi the area of Indus Kohistan close to Abbottabad where Osama Bin Laden lived in hiding until parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan and all of Baluchistan and Azad Kashmir provinces In general you are unlikely to stumble into a danger zone because foreigners require a No Objection Certificate NOC to visit such places and you wonâ t be given one of these without excellent local contacts The safest parts of the country are central Punjab Province and the area north of Gilgit extending as far as the Chinese border along the Karakoram Highway Check out the latest travel advisory information from your home government before you travel While the risk is small terrorist attacks and kidnappings do take place in Pakistan and street crime can be an issue in parts of Karachi Stay alert exercise caution and heed local advice on problem areas Be aware that Sufi and Shia shrines are sometimes targeted by extremists so visiting these locations can bring a slightly elevated risk Donâ t panic if you get an armed escort The Pakistani government is keen to protect the nationâ s tourism industry and officials sometimes insist that tourists take an armed guard to visit certain locations You donâ t have to pay for these guards but the use of their services is mandatory Some travelers find the guards somewhat constraining but their presence is usually just a precaution You may be given a police escort in places such as Swat the Kalash Valley and the scenic Fairy Meadows hiking area on the northern flanks of Nanga Parbat peak Get travel insurance and read the small print Good travel insurance is important for travel to Pakistan but be aware that most policies wonâ t cover you for areas where your home government advises against all travel For example in the British Foreign Commonwealth Office was advising against all travel to Swat and Peshawar amongst other destinations Check the latest government travel advisories for up to date information and plan your itinerary accordingly Give some thought to potential problems before you come Beyond security issues natural disasters such as flooding and earthquakes are unfortunately common at times in Pakistan while power cuts are a smaller but more frequent occurrence Monitor the local and international media for news on problem areas and if you get caught in a natural disaster follow the guidance of the authorities In terms of personal health intestinal problems are the most common complaints among foreign tourists the two golden rules are donâ t drink the tap water and be wary of pre cooked food Eating from busy stalls and restaurants where food is freshly cooked is the way to go Advertisement Advertisement
