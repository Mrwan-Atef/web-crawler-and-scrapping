Camping with Custodians in Western Australia how Aboriginal people are using tourism to tell their stories TRAVEL How Aboriginal people are using tourism to tell their stories in Western Australia On the beaches of remote Western Australia where the sea is the same colour as the sky the next generation of Aboriginal gameledes custodians have reclaimed their heritage and are using tourism to showcase their customs and knowledge to travellers in meaningful ways Member s of Australia s Stolen Generation like Bundy are now reclaiming their heritage Bundy s tours in Cape Leveque part of Western Australia s Dampier Peninsula a crab claw shaped region pinching the Indian Ocean in the Kimberley include a bush tucker walk spear fishing and night fishing Photograph by Nori Jemil By Emma Thomson April min read The article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Bundy s ageing but upright body moves swift as a pen across the smooth sand his feet marking his presence on the landscape as an author does on a page The tide is out as we wade into the mangroves fringing the shore searching their tangled roots for a glimpse of a claw He s dressed in a salt stained shirt and shorts but still forages for mud crabs the old way with a wattle tree spear He bends low and listens Then quick as a heron he jabs into the darkness and withdraws the branch with a snapping crustacean attached to the tip He rustles up a twiglet fire and flings on the crab The land tells us our dreaming lineage tells us where we belong he says I am a gamalede custodian so I look after our stories We stand side by side in silence on Cape Leveque part of Western Australia s Dampier Peninsula a crab claw shaped region pinching the Indian Ocean in the Kimberley looking out at this ancient land where the sea is the same colour as the sky and not a single building protrudes above the treeline This is a place where stories aren t flat creations confined to ink on paper but rather a time travelling life force linking past and present held by trees rocks animals and Aboriginal people who believe the world was created in the Dreamtime by snake emu eagle and kangaroo spirits Of course I m still practising and learning my language and customs Bundy adds It s a record scratch moment How can he still be learning I wonder He and many others are having to relearn because from to Australian government agencies and church missions forcibly removed as many as one in three Aboriginal children from their families and communities as part of what they called a civilisation programme severing them from their culture They moved us away from our stories and the land and it left an empty space says Bundy drawing shapes in the sand with his spear Those impacted became known as the Stolen Generation but many of them like Bundy are now reclaiming their heritage The Aboriginal Land Rights Act which first took effect in the Northern Territory in has allowed First Nations Australians across the country to take back traditional ownership of their lands and the Cape Leveque peninsula and its three main villages Djarindjin where Bundy hails from Lombadina and One Arm Point have had their native title land rights restored Western Australia was also the first state to embrace widespread dual use of English and Indigenous Australian place names for example Perth is also known as Boorloo and is now encouraging more Aboriginal people to work in the tourism industry The only road to remote Cape Leveque has finally been sealed granting year round access Bundy leads me towards a nearby plain of rocks Look he says pointing to the ground Pressed into the stone beside our feet is a trail of lithified footprints They are years old he says showing that his ancestors crabbed and fished here just as he still does But it s also a clear message Aboriginal people have a foot in both the present and the past one governed by clocks calendars and consumerism the other by sunrise seasons and stories Community camps Many are guilty of romanticising and even mythologising Aboriginal cultures and opportunities to learn about them have often felt contrived or at worst exploitative But a new venture is helping to change that supported by the WA government Camping with Custodians is a collection of campsites on Aboriginal lands across the Pilbara and Kimberley that are owned and operated by the community It injects money into the villages and also provides a chance for residents to work locally instead of being forced to migrate to towns by showcasing their customs and knowledge to travellers in meaningful ways through a series of day tours such as the one Bundy is offering so as to create true dialogue and understanding Djarindjin is home to one of six Camping with Custodians campsites spread across the region Here just over people reside in an area more than three times the size of London It s a paprika hued landscape where flies make honey seasons number six not four and history is written not on pages but on pearl shells The gateway to the Dampier Peninsula is Broome and it s here I meet Aboriginal guide Neville Poelino for a tour of the town You don t hear the black history of this place unless you walk with a blackfella he says flashing a boomerang smile from beneath his woven straw hat This was my stomping ground he adds an open arm sweeping towards the district known as Chinatown The Aboriginal Land Rights Act which first took effect in the Northern Territory in has allowed First Nations Australians across the country to take back traditional ownership of their lands and the Cape Leveque peninsula seen here and its three main villages Djarindjin where Bundy hails from Lombadina and One Arm Point have had their native title land rights restored Photogrpah by Greg Sullavan Getty Images Today this laid back town of one storey buildings is awash with coffee shops and jewellery stores and beloved for its uncrowded beaches and perennially sunny skies but until the it was a scruffy boisterous den of industry built on buttons Back then everyone was chasing mother of pearl shells not pearls those would be thrown back in the water I d collect them and use them to catapult birds to eat Now they sell for thousands of dollars says Neville leading me past the tin roofed Sun Pictures the world s oldest outdoor cinema and the Roebuck Hotel where locals perch on metal chairs out front pint in hand Us blackfellas needed a permit to enter a pub and you only got one if civilised white folk vouched for you and even then you still wouldn t be served But that s yesterday let s move forward We walk to the eastern outskirts of town where a pier of fresh planks juts out into the mangroves To the right of it sags the splintered original This is Streeter s Jetty our shells went everywhere from here I remember one guy even sent a shell to Switzerland with a message written on it Wanted house cleaner and possibly a wife At first the shells were harvested by Aboriginal divers but as demand grew indentured workers from Japan Malaysia China and other Asian countries were boated in to keep supplying per cent of the world s nacre The Malay camp was just to the right of Streeter s here I remember the first time they gave me some coriander to taste it was so strong I thought someone had put a stink beetle in my food After the pearl industry collapsed in the many of the divers stayed on and had families with Aboriginal women We have all colours in our blood grins Neville It s a reminder that there is no single Aboriginal culture The road to Djarindjin It was time to journey deeper into the Dampier and toward Djarindjin Before leaving Broome I rent a white Toyota Hilux camper nicknamed Tim but with monster tyres two rooftop tents and a kangaroo bar large enough to take on a rhino I nose miles northwards on the newly sealed Cape Leveque Road In fact it s the only road a single trail that arrows through a flat expanse of red baked earth studded with towering termite mounds man high flaxen scrub grass and trees gnarled and wrinkled by heat A mercurial shimmer hangs on the horizon and soon my phone signal shrinks to SOS calls only Road signs warn No Looning to remind drivers that if you crash help is a long way off The only hint of human touch is swerving tyre tracks on the road but in the hazy heat I can t be sure if they re not the slither marks of Alingun the Dreamtime rainbow serpent himself Cruising the dirt roads in Western Australia s Dampier Peninsula Photograph by Sam Valtenbergs Getty Images On my first approach I accidentally drive right past Djarindjin its roadhouse a momentary blip on the Roadrunner esque highway I swing around and pull up beside the two pump station Campsite manager Luke Sariago with a raft of raven hair emerges from a shipping container turned office waves me through the gate and directs me to my numbered plot on the fenced swathe of red dirt Nearby stand a pair of pristine wash blocks a kitchen and a laundry room It s simple and in keeping with the pared back landscape The community financed the campsite with money earned from a helipad they built as a refuelling stop for flying doctors Sunset is dialling down the blazing sun and the cicadas are starting to sing so I pop the roof tent and follow a trail of ants towards the central fire pit Three nights a week two Djarindjin elders Trevor Sampi and Audrey Chadforth gather here to tell guests stories My fellow campers a mix of Australians and Germans draw closer as Trevor slides a wooden boomerang through his hands and starts to speak Today we only use boomerangs for song and dance but they were for fighting and hunting too he begins the campfire flames flickering in the reflection of his glasses When I was younger men would have five or of these and stand metres apart and dare each other to come closer They d throw them so hard sparks would fly off the floor He rises from the rock he s sitting on and falls to one knee in the dirt enacting the fight The last one I saw still haunts me three guys against my uncle we lean forward He he we crane closer but some winged thing shrieks from the darkness and he trails off leaving us aching with anticipation I venture a question to the faces of the other guests glowing around the fire Why stay here After some hesitation a couple from Perth snap the silence We wanted to learn they explain Before we didn t have the infrastructure there were no tours to teach us After a pause another voice I m nearly and we learned nothing of Aboriginal culture in school but my son has been learning since kindergarten and I want to learn with him Afterwards I m guided back to my camper by the glow of gum trees up lit by van lights the shadows of bats shooting across the sparkling arc of the Milky Way Next to Djarindjin s traditional community of is the hamlet of Lombadina home to only but due to join Camping with Custodians next year The next morning already scorching I clamber into the of grey eyed Bud Sibosado whose family have been the main guardians of the village since the Bruce Wiggan Bardi Jawi artist in residence at Cygnet Bay Pearl Farm Photograph by Tourism Western Australia He grew up here but left for school in Broome and worked for seven years in Perth There was a lot of racism and ignorance in the city so four years ago I came home he says Like Bundy he leads mud crabbing tours and the money allows him to earn a living in his hometown but their histories are different My great grandmother was Bardi but my great grandfather was a Japanese orphan who was picked up by the Catholic mission Because he grew up in the regime he stopped us from attending ceremonies and speaking the language at home he says manoeuvring his minibus down a narrow sandy track towards his favourite crabbing creek I remember when I was a kid maybe years old an elder came and asked my dad if I was ready to come with them Dad said next year but it never happened Now it s too late for me to learn about Dreamtime because I wasn t initiated I feel frustrated I missed it because now I belong to both bloodlines and I belong to neither it spurs you on to change things for your children before the knowledge gets lost We sit in comfortable silence until we reach the creek where soldier crabs roll marbles of sand and barnacles cling to the mangrove roots Men s and women s business For Rosanna Angus her wiry ebony hair scraped back into a thick plait the effects of enforced religion are different The only female tour guide on the Dampier Peninsula she leads boat outings to Ewuny Sunday Island where a United Church mission was stationed until just before she was born and where she lived until before moving to One Arm Point on the mainland I was eight years old the first time I lived in a house she says quickly as we board the boat We ate turtles dugong stingray and fish there s still lots of stone traps around coast She points to the shallows where she explains rings of rocks trap fish as the tides rise and retreat We bounce out of Cygnet Bay into the gaping gulf of King Sound where whirlpools and waterfalls emerge mid ocean a local phenomenon Every day Sydney Harbour s worth of water pushes through the Sound in six hours shouts Rosanna above the spray curling over the bow into our faces When we re nearing Ewuny a nesting osprey eyes us from its castle of branches and the shadow of a turtle coasts through the azure shallows We ground the boat ashore a deserted beach and Rosanna strides ahead of us shouting in Jawi into the cove and surrounding rust red cliffs Then she pauses and listens Nods And turns back towards us When we bring someone new to our land we do a welcome ceremony We shout out to our grandfathers and say hey I m bringing these people to you they ve come from far and wide and bring good liyan spirit rest easy But you know it took me two years to learn how to offer a welcome in my own language She spreads a blanket on the crystalline sand pours out tea and hands us hunks of damper bread smeared with jam Many aspects of our culture are men s business only They have ownership of or the right to speak about all the traditional stuff like spears boomerangs and stories Those stories can t be told by women But history is free to discuss so I chose that Few women do the talking and I want to empower other women so they too can earn a living from tourism A cast of a Broome dinosaur footprint The original million years old footprints can be seen during low tide at the southern end of Cable Beach Photograph by Nori Jemil The Cape Leveque Road before it was sealed in It now grants year round access to this remote section of Western Australia s Dampier Peninsula Photograph by Tourism Western Australia On the last day I meet up with Rosanna s cousin Bolo Angus at the mouth of King Sound the final yawn of the Fitzroy River before it mingles with the Indian Ocean A chorus of croaks and whistles is coming from inside the mangrove fringed coastal flats and the skin singeing sun beats down on our heads Bolo is barefoot and wearing a baseball cap broad black sunglasses and a crisp red polo shirt Let s go to where my grandfather walked he says his sure footed strides being shadowed by Nijjee a golden purebred dingo he d rescued from the mangroves as a pup Bolo still bears the bush name of his grandfather Jumbadij I grew up the old way I did with my grandparents what they did with theirs because my grandparents lived in the bush to escape the Catholic mission he explains feet squelching into the silty sand Four generations before me they were walking naked with their riji I tilt my head questioningly It symbolises the rite of passage to manhood he says indicating a teardrop shaped shell he s carrying engraved with ochre stained symbols We don t have rock at Dampier pearl is our canvas I follow him deeper into the mangroves The bush is still our chemist and supermarket he says He holds his ear to the knot of a twisted tree its bark flaking off like old skin He raps it gently and tiny flies emerge as if responding to a knock at their front door They make honey he smiles Flies I ask He nods before darting over to a bush and stripping a few pods from its arms Wattle seeds when they re green you can foam them up he demonstrates by dipping his hands into the creek and vigorously rubbing seed and water together until a white mousse spills from between his fingers It gets rid of sweat rashes Then he looks to the sky Black cockatoos eat seeds that are toxic to people and always head for freshwater to wash them out so you can follow them if you re thirsty He s clearly in his element Tourism works well for us because our natural role is to pass down knowledge Sharing stories keeps them alive he says I ask whether he s always managed to have a foot in both worlds present and past In the city I ll walk past a white lady and she ll grip her purse Out here when I run tours they offer me drinks Tours reduce the divide he says soberly I m not angry The past is the past but the younger generations are lost because they don t know who they are now Camping with Custodians and initiatives like it may go some way to help rectify this Bolo explains how his teenage daughter Malati helps him prepare for tours and listens as he tells stories She will be part of the next generation of gameledes and offers hope that her father s fears may not come to pass Whenever I m away and start to feel lost I always come back to this place to ground me she tells me when she joins us just before I leave I m lucky to have a traditional family she adds Not everyone does How to get to Western
