Jean Talon MontrÃ al Kristi Blokhin Shutterstock Poutine has become a global phenomenon today appearing on the menus of restaurants and food trucks around the world Yet the dish will forever be associated with QuÃ bec the Canadian province where it originated The now iconic dish features twice fried fries topped with fresh squeaky cheese curds and a thin spiced gravy â called â brown sauceâ or â sauce brune â in French and made with beef and chicken gravies Poutine is a popular road trip snack an indulgence between last call and bedtime and a hearty hangover cure Itâ s the comfort food that always satisfies Hereâ s all you need to know about poutine â and where to find the best takes on it all over Canada Advertisement Poutine first took off at roadside snack shacks in QuÃ bec P F Mayer Shutterstock A short history of poutine Poutine originated in the late when car culture and casse croÃ tes â roadside snack shacks typically open in the summer and autumn to cater to warm weather vacationers â were thriving At the time french fries were sold in every snack shack in the province along with steamies hot dogs and soft serve ice cream Fresh cheese curds were and still are sold in snack sized bags often found piled near cash registers in gas stations fromageries casse croÃ tes and grocery stores As the story goes the dish was dreamed up by a group of regular customers at a casse croÃ te in either Drummondville or Warwick Both are on the south shore of the St Lawrence River between MontrÃ al and QuÃ bec City and both places claim to be the birthplace of the dish The group asked for a bag of cheese curds to be added to their fries and sauceâ and voilÃ Soon this pouding QuÃ bec slang for â a messy mixtureâ became known as poutine The hearty dish quickly won the hearts and stomachs of everyday QuÃ bÃ cois â especially university students across the province Somewhere around the poutine started showing up in restaurants across Canada and the USA even appearing on menus at McDonaldâ s and Burger King In the early chefs took things further experimenting with deluxe toppings like lobster foie gras and even caviar â and attracting the attention of those who had previously dismissed poutine as a messy dish for students and the working class These days the La Poutine Week festival which began in MontrÃ al in on the heels of the very successful Le Burger Week celebrates poutine by inviting restaurants in cities across Canada MontrÃ al and QuÃ bec City naturally but also Toronto Ottawa Winnipeg Calgary and Vancouver to create over the top gourmet poutines Thereâ s an app to see which restaurants are participating you can also rate the poutines youâ ve eaten Breakfast poutine at Buffet de l Antiquaire in Quebec City Photo by Pamela MacNaughtan The essential ingredients in poutine French fries form the backbone of every poutine The best ones are twice fried which makes them a little crispy outside but soft inside Poutine fries should always retain their shape when covered with gravy Be aware that poutine is usually served piping hot â so take care and wait until the dish cools a bit to avoid burning your mouth with the first bite Varying fry shapes including shoestrings wedges and chunky hash brown styles gourmet toppings and different sauces add variety But fresh squeaky cheese curds are essential this component is not the place for poutine experimentation Cheese is made by curdling milk which separates into liquid whey and small pieces of fresh solid cheese These fresh cheese curds can rest unrefrigerated for around hours they usually have a â refrigerate byâ date on them and total shelf life of about days and their low acidity keeps them from melting Melted cheese on poutine is kind of a clumpy mess poutine eaters will tell you that the ideal is to easily fork a cheese curd in the same bite as the fries and sauce and any other toppings Cheese curds that have been refrigerated change in consistency melt easily especially when you put hot gravy on them and lose that special squeak Itâ s just not the same Advertisement Granted if itâ s midnight and youâ ve been out drinking beer you might not be too picky about the state of your curds An attendee at the Toronto Poutine Festival Putting ketchup on poutine is might raise a few eyebrows in Canada Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images How to order poutine An important note to begin with in QuÃ bec itâ s pronounced â poo TEEN â with a voiced rather than nasal N sound The similar sounding word putain which does have a nasal ending is a slang term for prostituteâ and worse Ordering poutine at a casse croÃ te is straightforward Step Choose your toppings Traditional poutine consists of cheese curds fries and gravy From this base you might add such additional toppings as bacon hot dog pieces smoked meat chicken with peas ground beef with onionsâ or even an or â all dressedâ pepperoni with green peppers and mushrooms Youâ ll occasionally find lobster poutine with lobster bisque gravy or versions topped with red wine braised beef You can sometimes upgrade with extra cheese curds Step Choose a size Casse croÃ tes offer poutine in bÃ bÃ or mini extra small petit small moyen medium and grande large sizes Sometimes you can order mÃ ga or famille extra large and family portions Step Grab a seat and listen for your name or number The best casse croÃ tes are the busiest ones â youâ ll see a crowd massed out front if youâ re driving by â so while one person orders and waits for the food the others can look for a place to sit Most places have plenty of picnic tables sitting on the grass a curb or in a car is fine too If youâ re at a diner or a restaurant poutine usually comes as an appetizer entrÃ e in French or main plat Toppings and sauces vary to match the theme of the poutine Indian curry meaty Bolognese lobster bisque barbecue sauce and hollandaise to name a few Canada has poutine restaurants aplenty but the best poutine is
