attraction Rachel Chang Jun min read Share Follow Dolly s journey through her career at this new exhibit in Dollywood Â The Dolly Parton Experience If thereâ s one thing about Dolly Parton s plus years career itâ s that she can put her sassy trademark stamp on anything and make it distinctively â Dolly â Last November she released her first rock and solo album Rockstar to prove she deserved her spot in the Rock Roll Hall of Fame And now almost four decades after she started welcoming guests to Dollywood Parks Resorts in Pigeon Forge Tennessee and only a year after Dollywood opened its new roller coaster Big Bear Mountain the country legend opened a sleek new immersive museum like attraction called the Dolly Parton Experience on Friday Advertisement â Well I think you need to freshen up everything every now and then â the year old time Grammy winner told Lonely Planet during the opening festivities â We felt like my whole career had grown so much more than what we had in the old museum â The new Behind the Seams exhibit has displays of Dolly s clothes jewelry and shoes Â The Dolly Parton Experience A new chapter for Dollywood Replacing the more traditional Chasing Rainbows Museum closed in the Dolly Parton Experience goes big tripling the size of the original museum with four distinct spaces â I really love the fact that the fans can really see who I am where I came from what I ve done â she said â You can t do that with a few items here and there You can tell that story but this just makes it a bigger picture all over the way my life has been â The heart of the experience is Songteller Dollyâ s Journey following Partonâ s path starting from her modest Tennessee Smoky Mountain roots in Sevier County including a replica of the â Coat of Many Colors â hand sewn by her mom the original was discarded which inspired the hit song of that name Along the way visitors can sit on the swing from the Dolly variety show from the mid and pose behind the desk of the late Dabney Colemanâ s character from her movie to Across the way is Behind the Seams Dollyâ s Life in Rhinestones which is like stepping into a sparkly world that is Dollyâ s closet Inside are dazzling displays with butterfly jewelry heels of every color and a mega bag of pearls thatâ s been part of Partonâ s creative director Steven Summers â s longtime secret stash â Whatâ s funny is you ve seen those pearls for years â you just don t know it because I m still using them â he said chuckling over the fact that originally a dozen gross were ordered instead of just â A lot of it s trial and error â you don t know what works until you try it â Songteller is the heart of the new experience following Parton s career through the decades Â The Dolly Parton Experience Family affair Thereâ s also the DreamSong Theater with a Precious Memories exhibit in the front a multifaceted video dedicated to her family and friends â an appropriate entrance into the stage where one of her nieces headlines the theaterâ s inaugural show Heidi Partonâ s Kin Friends Heidi is the daughter of Dollyâ s late younger brother Randy Parton Advertisement Rounding out the area is one of Partonâ s old tour buses that visitors can climb right into Her niece Rebecca Seaver daughter of her younger sister Cassie Parton who serves as her archivist said itâ s â so wildâ because of all her childhood memories aboard both this bus and another one being used as a luxury accommodation the Dolly Suite starting at for two nights â Every time I m on one of those buses I m transported back immediately to road trips as a kid or being on tour with her â Seaver told LP â It s cool that the fans get to enjoy that too â those bunks were where we used to have little tea partiesâ and I might have kissed my first boy on that bus â Up close and personal with a new album Inviting fans into Partonâ s world in such a personal way makes the entire Dolly Parton Experience so intimate â A lot of my fans have learned a lot of stuff they didn t know â Parton said of early visitors who have had the chance to gaze at never seen before photos and get to know her family members more This is especially fitting since at the opening event she also announced her upcoming album will be family focused called Dolly Parton Family Smoky Mountain DNA â Family Faith Fables out November Overall the nature of the exhibits provide a more multi dimensional immersion â You can see where I ve been what I was doing while I was doing it and you can feel what I was feeling when I was doing it â she said â Not only that you can see where we re headed This is a whole experience â I really think that word kind of sums it up It really is an experience â Insider tip The public restrooms here might be the most Instagram worthy of any theme park Parton admitted that she and the Dollywood team had been wanting to upgrade several sections of the park but the museum made the most sense right now not just to grow in size but also keep up with â all the new digital stuff and multimedia â which not only enhances the guest experience but provides â more opportunitiesâ to continually upgrade and change out exhibits as her legacy keeps evolving Dollywood is at the start of a year plan that includes a third hotel Â The Dolly Parton Experience An ever growing legacy â It was just time to move it along â Parton said of the modernized museum experience â Youâ ve got to roll with the punches as they say and go with the times â After all the park has long been a part of the dream of the little girl from Sevierville with the first seed planted â very well back before I was ever a star â she told Lonely Planet The original theme park on the site had opened in as Rebel Railroad before switching to Goldrush Junction in and then Silver Dollar City in Parton remembered visiting as a child â I kept thinking that one day I m gonna have a theme park in my own home county â a bigger one â she said first articulating the vision to Barbara Walters in a interview The Herschend family who owned the theme park heard about Partonâ s dream and they turned it into a â joint venture and adventure which is what it has been â adding that they call her â Dolly Partner â Rewinding to Dollywoodâ s opening day in Parton says the younger version of herself had lofty expectations â Of course with any dream you hope it does well â she said â You have the desireâ and you just hope it comes true â Dollywood today and tomorrow That said what the park has transformed into â a acre resort with two hotels the DreamMore Resort which opened in HeartSong Lodge that opened last year and a water park Splash Country which opened in â has gone beyond expectations â Nobody could ever imagine what all of Dollywood has become through the years â she said assured that her self would â be thrilled like I am today â Even though itâ s her namesake park Parton Dollywoodâ s Dreamer in Chief shares the credit â It is doing so well now but we attribute that to a lot of great people â she said â Same with my career â nobody does anything alone â And the parks and resorts are just three years into another growth spurt a year million strategic plan which includes a third hotel is scheduled for â With all of the great minds that really love Dollywood for what it isâ we ll always be coming up with bigger and better things â Parton said â As long as time lasts we re gonna have people with kids places that people need to go to be entertained â and what better park could you ever find than Dollywood that has some of everything â
