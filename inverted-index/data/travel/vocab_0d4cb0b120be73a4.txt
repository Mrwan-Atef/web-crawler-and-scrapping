America s most impressive mountain scenery Set in the majestic Rockies of northern Montana Glacier National Park takes its name from the rivers of ice and glacial forces that shaped its rugged topography over two million years In addition to its namesake glaciers the park is renowned for massive U shaped valleys and hulking granite peaks carved by long ago ice flows A mosaic of rock ice forest and water like none other in the lower states the park safeguards one of the nation s most intact ecosystems says Andrew Smith of the Glacier National Park Conservancy It s also a Dark Sky Park

the way Lakeshores are another great photo op especially the view from Apgar Village across Lake McDonald the east side of Swiftcurrent Lake behind the Many Glacier Hotel Sun Point overlooking St Mary Lake and the view from the boat dock at Two Medicine Lake Backcountry trails provide almost unlimited scope for awesome panoramas with the Grinnell Glacier Overlook often cited as the park s single best viewpoint although it is a nine mile hike from Swiftcurrent or a mile trek from The Loop Where to find the park s best trails With more than miles of trails Glacier offers a hike for just about everyone The Many Glaciers area has some of the park s most popular hikes including an iconic mile trail to the base of Grinnell Glacier a strenuous climb up to Swiftcurrent Pass miles and a relatively easy jaunt to Ptarmigan Falls miles At the western end of St Mary Lake trails lead to three splendid waterfalls Trails in the Two Medicine area range from the short but highly scenic jaunt to Running Eagle Falls miles to more adventurous hikes to backcountry campgrounds at Upper Two Medicine Lake almost miles Oldman Lake miles and Lake Isabel almost miles Of course one of the longer Glacier hikes is the Continental Divide Trail which meanders miles through the park highlands between Marias Pass on Highway in the south to the U S Canada border in the north The route then crosses the international frontier into Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta Another epic long distance hike the Pacific Northwest Trail runs miles through the park s little visited northern region via remote lakes valleys and mountain passes For a glimpse of wildlife like bighorn sheep visitors can make the drive to Logan Pass on the Going to the Sun Road which is open to vehicles from the West Glacier and St Mary entrances The Highline Trail and Hidden Lake Overlook are a few places where adventurous hikers may see bighorn sheep but from a safe distance Barrett Hedges Nat Geo Image Collection The best spots for seeing wildlife Glacier National Park is one of those rare parks that boasts both grizzly and black bears Their habitat is more or less the entire park from the treeline down to lakeshores which means you can theoretically spot them just about anywhere crossing a road ambling through the woods frolicking in a meadow Wherever there are berries in the spring summer or early fall bears may be spotted Some of the best places are around Josephine and Swiftcurrent lakes in the Many Glacier area the north side of St Mary Lake between the entrance gate and Sun Point and the Rising Wolf side of Two Medicine Lake Scour the cliffs around Logan Pass for a glimpse of bighorn sheep or mountain goats and look groundward for marmots and ground squirrels that inhabit the rocky slopes around the visitor center In the early morning and late afternoon elk often graze in a large grassy area called Two Dog Flats near the St Mary entrance gate Visitors should always be aware that Glacier is bear country Bear spray is essential even on short walks As one Glacier ranger explains A grizzly doesn t care if you re walking yards or miles How to visit the park like a Nat Geo Explorer Born and raised near Glacier National Park National Geographic Explorer Megan N Parker spent her youthful summer and weekends canoeing the North Fork of the Flathead River cycling park roads and hanging out on some of the local lakes These days she roams the northern Rockies for a much different purpose Since founding an organization called Working Dogs for Conservation Parker has used canines to track grizzly bears mountain lions and wolves It s mostly in the snow she explains Following their tracks and collecting their skat for analysis to find out what they ve killed and eaten That way you get a lot of information on what they ve been doing how many there are the stage of life the animal is in are they eating the old and sick or are they just ravaging children The information can also tell us how wolves are coming back into the ecosystem how they re relating to the mountain lions and other behaviors But Parker rarely comes across the actual animals I spent this summer between Glacier and Banff looking for skat to get diet information It s just me and a dog and an orienteer out there in some of the most dense grizzly habitats in the world but we never see bears A storm moves in over Logan Pass located on the Continental Divide and at the highest point of the Going to the Sun Road in Glacier National Park Keith Ladzinski Nat Geo Image Collection Top
