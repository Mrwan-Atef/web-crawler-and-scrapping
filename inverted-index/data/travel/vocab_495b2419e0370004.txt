you figure out your next destination in Athens Â yiannisscheidt Shutterstock Though modern Athens extends from the sea to the mountains the cityâ s core where most of the ancient sites cluster around the Acropolis is compact and very walkable Visitors without mobility issues on short visits may find they can get around the sights entirely on foot But if you want to explore Athens outlying neighborhoods â or just rest for a bit â youâ ll find transport in Athens is affordable and easy to navigate particularly if you load a couple of key digital tools onto your smartphone Whether you re headed for the airport or the Ancient Agora here s a guide to the best ways to get around Athens Advertisement The Metro is a popular and cheap way to safely navigate Athens Â photooiasson Getty Images Use the metro to get to key sights like the Acropolis Museum The Athens metro is clean frequent and cheap with service from to just past midnight daily The system consists of three lines red blue and green with major transfer points at Omonia Syntagma and Monastiraki Key stops include Acropoli for the Acropolis east entrance and Acropolis Museum and Thissio for Kerameikos Line blue connects Syntagma and the airport but a special â return fare applies Aside from the airport and Piraeus most tourist destinations are in the center where the lines cross so walking is almost always more efficient A localâ s tip for riding the metro Itâ s good etiquette and makes life easier if you start making your way toward the doors early ideally right after the train has left the preceding stop Buses in Athens are very tourist friendly and easy to use Â Kypros Getty Images Buses are tourist friendly â but you ll need a smartphone to check routes Most of Athens is covered by a vast network of buses running from to midnight with some very limited night services The vehicles are tourist friendly screens show upcoming stops and announcements are made in Greek and English There are no published maps of the bus routes at stops but they are available on the O A S A website which also has a route planner Routes appear in Google Maps too so either install the app or plan your route before you head out A few express buses serve outlying destinations such as the airport and Piraeus and these cost more The Airport Express buses run hours a day and leave from the Intercity Bus Terminal Syntagma Square and the port Use the tram to get to the coast Slow but scenic Athens single tram line runs south from Syntagma to the seaside where the route splits and goes east and west along the coast The ride from the center to the nearest beach passing the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Center is about minutes Advertisement Taxis are an excellent option to get around Athens at night Â Getty Images Taxis are cheap by day expensive after midnight Athens doesn t have a ride sharing service but conventional taxis are inexpensive and handy at night when other public transport stops though the night rate effective after midnight and on holidays is about percent higher than the day rate The challenge for visitors is that many drivers speak very little English and some inevitably are unscrupulous in their dealings with out of towners Be aware that there are legitimate additional charges such as for tolls extra large luggage and entry to the airport A localâ s tip for taxi hailing Wave your arm aggressively and shout the name of the neighborhood youâ re headed to At busy times drivers will often take multiple passengers all headed in the same direction If you share take note of the meter reading when you get in then subtract that amount when you pay Use a ride hailing app to book a licensed taxi The Beat app summons a licensed Athens taxi gives an estimated price and lets your driver know where youâ re headed without a word You have the option of paying with cash or a credit card Mt Lycabettus offers stunning views of Athens Â Getty Images Cycling is still a bit hairy and traffic free bike paths are rare Athens city planners are trying to expand the bike network but sightseeing on two wheels is still difficult Challenges include hills reckless drivers oblivious pedestrians and teeth rattling cobbled streets One longer cycle path does run to the seaside however so getting out of town is a breeze Join a tour with Roll in Athens or rent an e bike from Solebike You re unlikely to need the suburban railway Realistically most tourists wonâ t use TrainOSE â s proastiakos regional rail services although there is a handy route from the airport to Piraeus If you do end up taking a regional train TrainOSE and Ath ena tickets are interchangeable for journeys within Athens Driving around Athens is a bit of a headache When you re up against traffic jams narrow and pedestrianized streets and extremely limited parking a car in Athens is more of a hindrance than an asset Rental cars are a reasonable option for trips out of Athens but for getting around downtown ditch the rental at the airport if you can Traveling into the hills of Athens gives great vantage points for city views Â Shutterstock Accessible transportation in Athens Unlike many poorly designed streets and entrances to sights in Athens the city s transport system does actually meet EU accessibility standards All metro stops have elevators usually very well placed for direct access to ticket machines offering easy transit down to platforms This is also handy if youâ re traveling with a lot of luggage Above ground buses can kneel to street level for wheelchair users and the mobility impaired but overall the metro is much easier to navigate than the bus system For a taxi with full wheelchair support contact Special Taxi which has a fleet of nine mini vans with wheelchair lifts For more resources see the Lonely Planet guide to accessible travel a free download An Ath ena ticket makes public transport cheap Athens has a unified ticket system so you can use the same ticket or pass on the metro bus tram and suburban rail system within the metro area except metro trips to the airport The Ath ena ticket â ena means one unified see â is a paper ticket sold at vending machines in metro stations and you can load it with single rides or passes Single rides cost â are valid for minutes and are discounted if you buy more than one Timed passes cost â for hours or â for five days When buying multiple tickets be careful with your calculations as the ticket can be refilled only when itâ s completely empty Note that the paper tickets issued for airport buses are not refillable If youâ re worried you might lose or damage a paper ticket or just want a souvenir buy the sturdier plastic Ath ena Card from a booth in any metro station These come preloaded with either five rides â or rides â and theyâ re refillable whenever you like If youâ re staying more than a month consider a personalized Ath ena Card youâ ll need to show your passport Whatever kind of Ath ena ticked you have just tap in on the readers at metro turnstiles or by the doors on buses and do this on every bus even if you transfer within the minute window Youâ ll need to tap out of the metro but not buses Consider a Tourist Ticket to save on the metro rides from to the airport If youâ re flying into Athens for a short visit you might find the three day tourist ticket useful Itâ s a special Ath ena Ticket that costs â and includes a round trip metro fare for the airport which would normally cost â But be careful with the return trip as you must tap out at the airport within the hour
