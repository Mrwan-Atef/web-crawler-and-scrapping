diverse voices speaking about travel inclusivity Sarah Greaves Gabbadon is a Miami based Caribbean travel expert award winning journalist and TV host who shares stories about the islands diverse culture lifestyle and people Photograph by Sarah Greaves Gabbadon TRAVEL Here s how travelers of color are smashing stereotypes The travel industry hasn t always welcomed everyone These people want to change that By Heather Greenwood Davis July min read In my family of four set out on an around the world trip Over the course of one year we visited more than two dozen countries We weren t the first family to set out on such an adventure but as we flipped through magazines and scanned the internet for examples we never found a traveling family that looked like ours Was it that people of color weren t traveling or that they weren t being included in travel coverage Turns out it s a bit of both In recent weeks the mainstream adoption of the Black Lives Matter campaign has pushed the issues around racial inclusivity into the spotlight and the travel industry hasn t been spared Groups such as the Black Travel Alliance BTA have formed to challenge travel organizations to share their diversity data and enforce policies to make the travel world more inclusive The BTA was created to support Black content creators around the world and increase their representation in the travel industry says Martinique Lewis a travel diversity consultant and a BTA founder We are committed to uplifting educating and providing resources for people that look like us Ernest White II is the producer and host of television travel docu series Fly Brother with Ernest White II Photograph by Ernest White II Shivya Nath is a sustainable traveler and author of the memoir The Shooting Star Photograph by Shivya Nath Empowering diverse voices As one of only a few African Americans to host a travel show Ernest White II says visibility is empowerment He uses his show Fly Brother which airs on PBS stations as a conduit and catalyst for transformation in the travel space My show is not a Black show my show is a human show that has a Black gay host says White And what that does is show everyone that we all have a place in this world We intentionally bring on friends of mine who are bona fide friends and who represent the spectrum of humanity For Shivya Nath author of the travel memoir The Shooting Star visual representation is important because it allows people to broaden their idea of what a traveler looks like As a brown traveler I don t fit into the mold of someone exploring the world says Nath who grew up in India A white person can be an explorer a vegan a solo female traveler an outdoor enthusiast a culture seeker But a person of color is a person of color first Nath hasn t let other people s limited expectations stop her from spending nearly seven years as a nomadic backpacker or exploring spaces such as Iran and Armenia solo I see myself as a global citizen capable of shaping my own perspective of the world largely uninfluenced by those who ve experienced it before me Related Discover what this writer learned as a black solo traveler After working with Teach for America and spending months backpacking the globe Amanda Machado writes and leads conversations about the intersection of race travel and gender Photograph by Amanda Machado Representation needed The absence of diversity in travel is particularly surprising given statistics over the last few years that show travelers of color are big players when it comes to recreational spending U S Hispanic travelers spend more than billion globally in leisure travel annually African American travelers spend upwards of billion globally Asian American travelers have a projected spending power of trillion globally by A Accenture survey of travel industry diversity and inclusion initiatives found that percent of travelers care about whether a travel company is offering products and services targeted to their diverse segment Amanda E Machado a Latinx writer and facilitator who focuses on the intersections between race gender travel and the outdoors says for many people of color it takes a herculean effort to begin traveling The way the system is structured in the United States unfortunately a lot of people of color end up getting stuck on the realm of How do I survive in the system says Machado That doesn t leave us much space for taking time to explore and adventure and make mistakes and get lost Diverse images and stories of communities of color are missing in part because of who the storytellers are I find it puzzling that in travel which is by definition the most diverse beat anyone could have we are still so homogenized in who is telling the stories says freelance travel writer and host Sarah Greaves Gabbadon An expert in Caribbean travel Greaves Gabbadon says out of the dozen journalists she knows that share the beat only about one quarter are Black writers of Caribbean descent In we re still viewing the Caribbean through a white gaze she says noting that it is particularly problematic for countries steeped in a history of colonialism That s not to say there isn t a place for a white viewpoint but we should be hearing all the voices Lewis points out that very few Black travel journalists hold positions at travel publications and that Black influencers just like Blacks in other industries earn less than their white counterparts Systemically entrenched publication policies like those at The New York Times that demand travel writers finance their own trips but don t pay wages that can support those costs also play a role in whose viewpoints are shared says Greaves Gabbadon You will never hear my voice or the voices of many other talented Black writers in The New York Times because of it Related Here s why diverse perspectives make for better stories John Graves created Adventures an online adventure community to inspire and encourage people to explore the world every day Photograph by John Graves Oriana Koren documents the world and pushes for inclusivity in the photography community for people of color as a founding member of the Authority Collective Photograph by Lauren Crew Creating a safe space It also means that stories will often focus on diverse travelers as a monolith failing to dive deeper into the unique attributes and interests of travelers within race John Graves created his online group Adventures as a self motivation tool to fit his love of being active in the outdoors The year old educational psychologist who has run ultramarathons and marathons in countries states and continents says he has rarely spotted another Black person at the starting line Until recent calls for more diverse coverage he d accepted that he was likely a unicorn I ve seen more and more kinds of diverse groups popping up like Black Girls Hiking and Outdoor Afro and others he says They were talking about the lack of diversity in the outdoors But for Greaves Gabbadon the lack of inclusive imagery can be a deterrent to people who don t see themselves represented It would be great if brands would recognize that the Black audience isn t exclusively young and or urban says Greaves Gabbadon whose travels include running as well Perennial women like me are active energetic and have the means and motivation to travel too As a Black queer non binary person ethno photographer Oriana Koren enters situations hoping to go unnoticed but is routinely approached threatened and denied entry into spaces their white colleagues can access without reproach Wherever I go in the world there are really difficult ideas about anti blackness that I have to combat they say I don t get the kind of space to just dive into my work and think about it and just be there Koren made the decision the carve out their own space in the travel industry by primarily photographing people of color around the world I purposely don t photograph white people wherever I go if possible says Koren because everyone thinks that people who are tourists who explore the world who are adventurers are white and I didn t want to participate in that mythology When Nailah Blades Wylie moved to Utah she didn t immediately feel welcome while exploring the outdoors Author Heather Greenwood Davis with her family on Route Photograph by Heather Greenwood Davis Nailah Blades Wylie started Color Outside as a safe place for women of color to come together and explore the outdoors Photograph by Nailah Blades Wylie Obviously the outdoors is for everyone she says but the way that the outdoor world has been marketed hasn t been for everybody It very much seems like this very exclusive club I m sure even when people think of outdoorsy they think of a white male and he s probably wearing Patagonia Blades Wylie s own experiences with racism and assumptions in the outdoors including a police officer s disbelief that her family goes on snowshoe treks led to her founding Color Outside The organization offers retreats for women of color providing a safe group from which to explore adventures These kinds of organizations are particularly important says Machado because diverse communities have been historically or culturally excluded from these spaces via intentional systemic barriers A dearth of Black swimmers in California can be traced to a history of segregated pools and beaches that made swimming unsafe she says A combination of segregation white people abandoning city pools for private clubs resulting in a low priority for city pool maintenance and the later installation of splash pads and wading pools instead of pools with any swimmable depth in cities played a role in would be swimmers of color learning how to swim A lack of hikers of color on Oregon s trails can partly be traced to the state s founding charters that worked to keep diverse populations out the discriminatory language wasn t completely removed from the Oregon Constitution until a history of lynching in the woods and other violent acts toward people of color on secluded trails The current five year plan of the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department notes that while Black people make up percent of Oregon s population they only make up percent of daily visitors Latinx people percent of the population make up only percent of day visitors On the other hand white people who account for percent of Oregon s population make up percent of day visitors to the state s outdoor spaces Related Learn about how national parks are working to fight racism There s honestly so many incidents of hate crimes harassment and violence in these spaces that I think the remnants of the explicit historical exclusion still feels very present to this day says Machado For Blades Wylie finding a connection with other travelers and outdoor enthusiasts of color has been empowering for her There have been forces that have been telling us overtly or not that we don t belong but we do says Blades Wylie We deserve to be able to take up space in this way Heather Greenwood Davis is a contributing editor for Nat Geo Travel Follow her on
