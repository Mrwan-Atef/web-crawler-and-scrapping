Lost Waterfalls Trail There are numerous epic hikes around ChiriquÃ â s lush landscapes but the trail leading to three dazzling waterfalls near Boquete is one of the most popular The out and back miles trail is well signposted but can be steep and slippery surrounded by evergreen jungle lofty trees outsized foliage and twisting vines â look out for sloths monkeys and elusive quetzals The first waterfall is the highest and endlessly photogenic so some hikers leave it until last Thereâ s more climbing to reach the second waterfall a powerful cascade that tumbles off a cliff edge into a small rock strewn pool Waterfall three is the most difficult to reach but arguably the most stunning and there are ropes to help you up My favorite thing to do in ChiriquÃ After a hard dayâ s hiking I love
