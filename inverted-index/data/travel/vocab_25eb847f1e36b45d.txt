feed on good ideas in Zurich announces Ity Tiwari an Indian born Zurich based vegetarian food blogger and chef As a vegetarian I m continually delighted by the creativity and quality of dishes here But I m just as obsessed with Zurich s humanity and the determination to do things the right way with many restaurants pioneering zero waste and community driven initiatives Lunch is a little earlier than expected on our gastronomic tour we re headed to the new company canteen at On in Zurich West On is one of Switzerland s best loved brands producing Swiss engineered footwear with a cult following On have collaborated with a local vegan eatery called Roots to develop Switzerland s first plant based office canteen Ity explains Roots Food Lab next to the On flagship store is also open to the public and stars such as Roger Federer have been spotted dining here An airy contemporary space it feels like the workplace of the future and the vegan buffet is equally pleasing A collaboration between Swiss footwear brand On and Roots Food Lab this new canteen offers a range of delicious plant based dishes Photograph by Charly Derouet The On canteen may be a new development but we are about to learn that Zurich has long been forward thinking when it comes to food Our next stop is Hiltl which opened in and is recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world s oldest continually open vegetarian restaurant Here the in house plant based butcher s shop Hiltl Vegimetzg is Switzerland s first Visit for vegan wines plant milks cookbooks and innovative plant based deli meat alternatives Hiltl s Milo Stegmann explains that although only of the Swiss population is strictly vegetarian many more of Zurich s citizens regularly enjoy meat free meals In Zurich people eat a vegan lunch without even noticing it s vegan he says Hiltl is a historic institution but it s not content to rely on heritage alone I ask about community impact and sustainability and Milo replies We took avocados off the menu as we had ethical concerns about water waste so our chefs developed an alternative pea based guacamole that s really popular With ever evolving menus and ethical sourcing Hiltl is one of a number of Zurich eateries championing positive change The dishes at Roots Canteen range from baked enchiladas to salads curries and pastas all of which are plant based

indulgent establishment housed in a century listed building This historic cafe is now run by the Arbeitskette Foundation which aims to integrate disadvantaged young people including participants in Switzerland s migration programme into the hospitality industry Ity tells us they serve the best hot chocolate in the city As I sip a deliciously creamy cup in the lavishly decorated drawing rooms I m inclined to agree This is a treat on all levels As we continue down Napfgasse a narrow alley lined with patisseries and delicatessens Ity points to Schwarzenbach a heritage grocery that started specialising in bean to bar chocolate and fairtrade single origin coffee decades before it was fashionable A little further down is Äss Bar bakery which aims to cut down Zurich s food waste by selling day old baked goods from the city s top bakeries at knockdown prices This makes quality items like sandwiches from Sprüngli Switzerland s best known high end bakery affordable to students explains Ity Zurich is a truly international city and this makes the food scene endlessly interesting she adds as we dip into Zurich s answer to Harrods Food Halls the grand basement at Jelmoli the city s swishest department store It s a treasure trove of Swiss and international delicacies and one could spend hours in the condiments section alone or tasting slivers of gouda at the cheese counter It s not just the quality of the locally sourced ingredients that makes Zurich such a great city for food lovers says Ity It s the creativity and passion behind the new ventures too Food in Zurich isn t just about
