difficult and pretentious to write about a symbol and criticize an institution The Auberge de l Ill a gourmet adolescent s dream that only adults can afford How beautiful this house is and how many celebrities crowned heads starred chefs and heads of state has it welcomed However the hall of fame is dated and one of the three stars has joined the firmament next to that of Monsieur Paul the great friend of the house on rue de Collonges in Mont d Or She joined him for the same reasons I think the certainty of eternity the bet on the past and especially on the image of the latter This does not take away from the perfection and quality which are still relevant today The great French refinement the quantity the precision of cooking and sauces the adapted wine list all highlighted by classic white tableware and a service perfectly executed by a caring brigade I had a great time there and ate perfectly and that s probably the main thing You simply have to be perfectly aware of what you are looking for and what you find there But be careful the new wave won t do any favors and I can t see Bibendum adding the star to the little family of triples Maybe it s not necessary anyway The aging and essentially German Swiss clientele with oversized purchasing power reveals the institutionality of the place and contributes to its heaviness She should not freeze this superb house within the thick walls of its history Read more Written August This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews as part of our

de l Ill is picturesquely located right on the river in the picturesque village of Illhäusern The trees and the idyllic garden provide a very beautiful backdrop both on the terrace and in the restaurant area The ambience is classically elegant and the interior is understatedly luxurious you immediately feel in good hands and very comfortable The service is highly professional the chef de rang exudes a pleasant confidence you can feel his passion for his job We are here today to make you happy The kitchen of this house has been awarded three Michelin stars for over years It offers a very nice selection of both classic and modern dishes some with Asian accents The Haeberlin menu is an impressive showcase and a great journey of pleasure It is a special pleasure and experience to enjoy both the iconic classic Salmon Soufflé Auberge de l Ill and the fish course of the current menu The density and finesse of the aromas the high quality products the textures and last but not least the appearance are a real spectacle Another highlight is the cheese trolley with its beautiful selection everything is of the highest quality and matured to perfection When Marc Haeberlin personally bids you farewell in the foyer you have the feeling that you have spent a very special evening Read more Written October This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and

classic still rolling Sep family Its a great location and a memorable meal I had the abalone which i think was my best ever the sauce alone was heavenly Once we got going service was prompt with ample delicious bread provided Portions are quite large for a fine dining restnt My wifes salmon souffle was divine Its clearly not near and seems not to be trying we wanted a glass of white wine as aperitif they wanted to serve us champagne the resultant stand off took more amusing than annoying The lamb dish was hardly edible we should have sent it back Staff are many and their roles are regimented inevitably requests had to be repeated i am not a regular but this could quickly cross the line from amusing should it be a business dinner Read more Written December This review is the

learn more contribution of bubbles What a desappointment Oct friends We were people delighted at the idea of spending a great gastronomic moment in a particularly beautiful place The place is in fact particularly beautiful Bright setting very tasteful general arrangement table facing the bay windows overlooking the garden magnificent in this early autumn where we were moreover able to have coffee and hang out after lunch On the other hand the gastronomic moment was far from being up to the rest If the service is impeccable with staff present without being heavy with a touch of good humor the first course of the Haeberlin Menu must have proved premonitory of what was to follow the trout marinated with beetroot It turned out to be unremarkable almost bland barely saved by a few broken hazelnuts and grains of bad caviar If the excellent line caught hake which followed gave some hope these were quickly dashed by a rubber lobster a shame for any self respecting restaurateur By luck the piece was quickly settled given its size the menu is euros even for a so called tasting menu No research into the tiny piece of venison that followed despite a tempting accompaniment but only on the menu The finale a dessert without research seeming like a baba made from pear without any flavor which the banal vanilla cream had difficulty getting across What can we say about the wines a poor Muscat as an aperitif followed by glasses on the sommelier s suggestion or among the whites only the viré claissé and the Sauterne for dessert have earned their place among many others a pinot blanc and a really ordinary condrieu euros for glasses euros for muscat The glass of red Pessac Léognan softens the sadness What a gastronomic disappointment No research dishes seeming sloppy the impression that we are living on very withered laurels overestimated by one star too many again Only the price remains starry We ask to see Mr Haeberlin he is absent But the staff is present efficient professional friendly Thanks to them and them only Read more Written October This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews as part of our industry leading trust safety standards Read our transparency report to learn more Reisender contributions of bubbles Unfortunately not up to expectations Sep couples Well what can you say a star was taken away we think rightly We visited years ago including an overnight stay fantastic A second visit at the beginning of September a lovely welcome a glass of champagne on the Ill in beautiful weather the sommelier was asked to recommend a Riesling which he did when asked for an alternative he pointed straight to a bottle for euros a bit too expensive for me alone my wife could only enjoy the champagne due to illness I also pointed that out We ended up with a bottle from Emile Beyer euros OK it was delicious The non alcoholic cocktail doesn t deserve a mention just sweet We were then seated in what was probably the darkest corner of the restaurant an alcove The starters langoustines and the mousseline de grenouilles were very good as expected The disaster was clearly the Bresse Mieral The service had a lot of trouble carving the poultry they moved the serving table out of our sight I probably shouldn t have seen the misery of cutting it up The enjoyment was limited it was just tough The service obviously didn t miss this we ate up and didn t want to complain obviously a mistake but really we just wanted to end our stay quickly We didn t have cheese or dessert The Baeckaoffa yes diced more or less overcooked vegetables in a broth was supposed to be truffled well if you know So I m sorry for a very special reason we wanted to experience the pleasure from October again Unfortunately we especially my wife weren t able to repeat this experience Read more Written October This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not

the Auberge de L Ill for the second time It can be positively stated in advance that nothing has changed The foie gras the salmon soufflé the fillet of lamb and the chocolate for dessert tasted just as good as they did then The service is consistently friendly and accommodating They don t wear sneakers T shirts or open shirts but suit tie and black shoes that s a good thing The only difference we noticed was that in there were many Americans and Japanese in the restaurant this time mostly Swiss and French The family is no longer visible maybe we didn t recognize the third generation either and is probably predominantly in charge Jean Pierre Haeberlin had explained his paintings to us at the time Paul Haeberlin said goodbye to the guests In our opinion the succession to younger employees in the active activity has taken place without any change in appearance The older employees presented on the homepage managed the younger employees discreetly but were no longer involved in serving or wine consulting themselves Finally a warning must be issued In front of the church was is a mirror smooth glass plate not recognizable under snow on which I almost lay down nasty so please pay close

that few establishments can boast of The map certainly does not show originality but the important thing is elsewhere When the customer leaves with a smile saying that we won t have to wait too long

magnificent table in a splendid location with sensational staff Nov couples This is the time we have had the pleasure of eating at this establishment and for the time we had a magical time Luckily for this edition we were able to discover another room After having been in the Alsatian room years ago in the dovecote last year we are now installed in the Veranda And wow this room is magnificent As soon as we arrived at the restaurant we were welcomed very warmly and it was very pleasant Throughout the meal the staff was very caring smiling and extremely kind special mention for Stéphane the Maître d hôtel and for the sommelier The meal was magical we see that we are in one of the best gourmet restaurants in France The dishes were delicious from appetizers to sweet treats And what about the wines offered with taste and knowledge by the excellent sommelier These hours spent at the table were a real taste pleasure and this pleasure would not have been as wonderful without the professionalism and kindness of all the staff of this house This should be emphasized because this is unfortunately not the case in all establishments Thank you to the Auberge de l Ill for this

few seconds on the various networks available to us and where we so often forget that we are criticizing and sometimes demotivating humans who are doing their best to satisfy our needs desires and our
