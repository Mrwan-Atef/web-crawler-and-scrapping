Where to eat in Tinos Greece Tinos is close enough to Athens to add on to a trip to the capital Photograph by George Vdokakis TRAVEL How to spend the perfect food weekend on the Greek island of Tinos This little outpost in the Aegean has become famous among Greeks as an island of gastronomy in recent years By Anastasia Miari March This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK The Cycladic island of Tinos southeast across the Aegean Sea from Athens is said to owe its rock strewn landscape to a mighty clash of the Titans In Ancient Greek mythology the Titans slung colossal granite boulders at each other during a brawl and these now dot the island s wildflower meadows marble quarries and sprawling vineyards But this breezy little island isn t just famous for its scenery Blessed with fertile land and a resulting bounty of locally grown produce Tinos has become known as an island of good food among Greeks in recent years and Athenian chefs will often leave their city restaurants in the warmer months to head here for a feast of a summer Tinos Food Paths a festival of gastronomy celebrated in the second week of May each year marks the beginning of the season of indulgence Here s how you can enjoy your own gastronomic journey around Tinos Day One Morning Start the day with breakfast at one of the oldest cafes on the island O Megalos Kafenes is a traditional Greek cafe in Pyrgos one of the most beautiful villages in Tinos which sits amid quarries of the rich white marble that s found in abundance here Pull up a pew at a marble table in the dappled shade of an enormous plane tree and sip on a silty Greek coffee with a galaktoboureko pastry on the side layers of crispy filo filled with creamy custard Afternoon Kolimvithra beach on the north coast of the island is one to head to for a relaxed bohemian atmosphere and a great surf scene Thanks to the strong winds of the Aegean this stretch of sand gets good surf and is the best spot on Tinos to learn to ride the waves A pop up beach bar in a converted VW van adds to the hippy feel Choose from a selection of fresh village salads and acai bowls made with local produce such as wild strawberries Fourtalia a popular dish in Tinos is a style of fluffy omelette made with potatoes Photograph by Marco Arguello Evening Don t turn up to this one without a booking To Thalassaki has become so popular that the yachting crowd regularly sail over from nearby Mykonos Specialising in Tinian seafood with a refined twist it s so close to the sea s edge that your flip flops could be in danger of being washed away by the waves The mussel shrimp and calamari pasta dishes are famous here as are the ouzo steamed mussels Just above To Thalassaki sits Exo Meria a lofty bar overlooking the inky blue Aegean with one of the best sunset views on the island Day Two Morning Hidden from the view of marauding pirates Tripotamos village in the south was cleverly built as a maze like settlement which only reveals itself once you step inside its narrow alleyways The Crossroads Inn here offers one of the best breakfasts with a focus on Tinian produce Start the day with organic eggs vine ripened tomatoes and sourdough bread followed by traditional spanakopita pies Greek yoghurt honey and a selection of home made jams marmalades and cheeses Afternoon Tinos is giving Santorini a run for its money where

Assyrtiko a refreshing dry white to the dark and spicy Mavrotragano The most beautiful vineyards on the island are Volacus and T Oinos where you can sip a chilled glass in the afternoon sun Evening
