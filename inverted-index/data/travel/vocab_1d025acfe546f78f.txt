Rachel Jones Ross By Chloe Berge December min read If you ve been clamoring to see the ethereal northern lights consider heading to Canada where they ribbon through the sky days a year in certain regions Northern Canada in particular offers the best chance to see aurora borealis because much of the region lies beneath the auroral oval the area around Earth s magnetic poles that are a hot spot for activity Auroras occur when the sun s electrically charged particles enter the atmosphere on a solar wind colliding with gases and producing tiny flashes that fill the sky with neon light The best time to spot them in Canada is from December to March when there are more hours of darkness and cold clear nights or between August and October when the midnight sun begins to dim but the weather allows for outdoor activities like hiking and paddling For a richer experience travelers can pair northern lights viewing with cultural and adventure activities in many destinations Here are five unique ways to catch one of nature s most breathtaking phenomena Dene Indigenous aurora hunting Northwest Territories The Northwest Territories sit above Canada s three western provinces and is home to the region s Indigenous Dene peoples In Yellowknife North Star Adventures offers a safari style aurora hunting experience with cultural immersion Travelers ride in an SUV making multiple stops as tour founder Joe Bailey reads the sky in pursuit of the lights The reason I called it aurora hunting is because of the Dene cultural connection to my grandfather who would take me hunting for caribou moose and buffalo he says I wanted to incorporate that traditional activity into the name of the tour In the Denesuline language we call the lights ya ke ngas which means the sky is stirring Bailey continues We believe the lights are the spirits of our ancestors and loved ones telling us everything is OK For more Indigenous insights cozy up in an aurora viewing dome with North of Adventures or
