and waterfalls Egill Bjarnason Mar min read Share From the southwest corner of Iceland you have easy access to some of the country s most iconic sights Â Creative Family Shutterstock Back in the day when Icelandâ s founding fathers decided to make ReykjavÃ k the nation s capital they were in fact doing future visitors a massive favor the southwestern corner is an excellent base for exploring many of the country s most iconic sights from glacial caves to steaming lagoons Here are four of the best day trips from ReykjavÃ k accessible year round Advertisement Iceland Day Trip To The Golden Circle The Golden Circle Why go The route loops three iconic sights Ã ingvellir Geysir and Gullfoss The famous Golden Circle is a mile route covering two continents â yes continents The first stop on the itinerary is Ã ingvellir National Park which marks the tectonic plate boundaries for Europe and North America pulling apart the landscape with canyons and cracks But there s an added layer of history that makes this Unesco World Heritage site all the more unique Icelandâ s parliament Althingi was founded at Ã ingvellir in the year CE Geysir has been Icelandâ s world famous natural phenomenon since the invention of printed illustrations It also served as an inspiration for the English language the word geyser â a periodically spouting hot spring â draws from this Geysir with a capital G To the surprise of many the old Geysir has long since retired today the spouting icon of Iceland is instead the neighboring Strokkur erupting every minutes give or take A minute drive from Geysir is the waterfall Gullfoss cascading down a powerful glacial river The name means golden waterfall and on a sunny day we can guarantee an impressive rainbow Guests need to walk about miles from the parking lot for a close â and wet â view of this Icelandic landmark A final tip The Icelandic Tourism Board operates digital counters monitoring traffic to major sights by the hour an excellent tool for travelers seeking to avoid big crowds at Gullfoss and Geysir Choosing a Golden Circle route from ReykjavÃ k The shortest version of the Golden Circle goes via Laugarvatn Longer day tours take a wider loop around southern Iceland by extending to FlÃºÃ ir and Selfoss Side attractions include the year old explosion crater KeriÃ and the geothermal lagoon at Gamla Laugin Visitors can go some miles into LangjÃ kull s ice cap Â Jonathan Percy Shutterstock LangjÃ kull Glacier Why go For snowmobile tours and the ice tunnel Advertisement Icelandâ s second largest glacier is open for visitors â literally The glacier has a door the shape and size of a massive drill leading some miles into the ice cap Completed in this human made tunnel is operated by the company Into the Glacier and only accessible via super Jeep Because the natural ice caves at the foot of a glacier break down when temperatures rise in the spring the tunnel is located on top of the ice cap for year round accessibility LangjÃ kull has spectacular snowmobile routes with mountains peeking from the ice cap and snow topped hills bound to get the adrenaline flowing But most amazing is the endless desolation drivers experience by crossing at high speeds without landmarks Excursions last about an hour and are operated by Mountaineers of Iceland and Arctic Adventures How to get from ReykjavÃ k to LangjÃ kull Tours from ReykjavÃ k take at least hours altogether Roads to the foot of the glacier are only accessible by large trucks but with a rental car it is possible to arrange a pickup where the tarmac ends For visits to Into the Glacier that means driving to HÃºsafell to the west snowmobile tours operate on the southern side near Gullfoss Waterfall The most visited tourist destination on the island Blue Lagoon is conveniently located minutes from the airport Â Roberto La Rosa Shutterstock Blue Lagoon Why go To soak in a unique bath resort When you think of Iceland no doubt one of the first things that comes to mind is the Blue Lagoon Walking out in a fluffy white bathrobe to milky blue water surrounded by lava is the epitome of relaxation and luxury Conveniently located minutes from the airport there s a reason it s the most visited tourist destination on the island The lagoon has health benefits too Silica in the water causes the blue green color but it also creates a soft white mud on the lagoonâ s floor that can help with skin conditions including psoriasis Prices vary depending on the time of day ranging from â to â US to and require an advance reservation Towels are provided and guests must shower before entering How to get from ReykjavÃ k to the Blue Lagoon Upon booking a ticket online guests can pay additional â for transportation between either KeflavÃ k Airport or downtown ReykjavÃ k Multiple bus operators in ReykjavÃ k also offer scheduled tours HvalfjÃ rÃ ur Why go For pristine hiking paths A long zigzag drive down HvalfjÃ rÃ ur used to be an inevitable part of leaving ReykjavÃ k to the west But on a sunny day in the underwater HvalfjÃ rÃ ur Tunnel shortened the Ring Road by an hour and the branch shaped history laden Whale Fjord became a quiet detour One of Icelandâ s tallest waterfalls Glymur welcomes those still taking the long way around the fjord â but you ll have to go on foot Prepare for a multi hour trek with some rewarding views over HvalfjÃ rÃ ur The path is a mile loop starting in Botnsdalur at the fjordâ s bottom The route is only in elevation but still moderately difficult with two steep hills It s not ideal for young children or the inexperienced â hikers need to cross a river stream either barefoot or wearing proper footwear and those taking the entire loop will cross a second stream close to the waterfall Budget at least three hours A shorter one hour hike goes to the Ã vottahellir Cave How to get to HvalfjÃ rÃ ur A rental car is the best way to visit HvalfjÃ rÃ ur The tunnel is designed to be the default choice for drivers so it s easy to miss the turn â watch out for the sign pointing to Route The context HvalfjÃ rÃ urâ s violent history HvalfjÃ rÃ ur is historically known for two deadly industries whaling and warfare Allied forces in WWII guarded the fjordâ s narrow mouth like an entrance to a fortress and based naval operations at the bottom The largest preserved settlement of army barracks is by the main road at MiÃ sandur farm the War Peace Museum tells the story Just nearby is a whaling station where massive baleen whales have been dragged on land and sliced up over the years The factory has been idle since but is not
