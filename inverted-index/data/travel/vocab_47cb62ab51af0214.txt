Marrakesh Mandy Sinclair Dec min read Share Marrakesh can be a sensory overload for first time visitors so read on for some local advice before you go Balate Dorin Shutterstock I lived in Marrakesh full time for almost years with no intention of leaving My life in Morocco was colorful diverse and endlessly inspiring for a curious creative soul like me And today the cityâ s intrigue and magic continues to pull me back I will never tire of wandering the tiny alleyways of the Marrakesh medina stopping for a nouss nouss at Cafe des Epices or gazing at the art deco architecture throughout my Gueliz neighborhood stepping inside to discover independent art galleries Picture perfect guest houses and chefs putting a creative spin on local cuisine are also part of the charm The design scene in Marrakesh is second to none and in my opinion unique in Morocco as traditional artisans sell their wares alongside contemporary designers putting a new touch on the traditional techniques and crafts Advertisement A visit to Marrakesh is not about ticking sites off a must see list but rather meandering â stumbling upon a historic site and watching the world go by from a street side cafe â the city itself is a sight Allow three days to see the main historical sites sample local cuisine and take in a bit of shopping but design lovers could easily spend a week here Plan your days prior to arrival While there is something to be said for spontaneous wanders and chance encounters Marrakesh is the countryâ s leading tourist destination and guides experiences and restaurants book up days weeks and months in advance in the high season La Jardin Majorelle and the nearby MusÃ e Yves Saint Laurent require online advance bookings via their website To ensure a table at popular restaurants like La Famille and Nomad book prior to arrival for best availability There are multiple options for getting from the airport into town depending on your budget Shutterstock Book an airport transfer or catch the local bus Itâ s easiest to organize an airport transfer via your accommodation provider for a smooth arrival especially if it is your first visit Taxis from the airport are now regulated so this is also a good option A city bus departs frequently from the airport to Djemaa el Fna and destinations throughout Gueliz for that s around US and is cash only Find the bus stop beyond the waiting taxis near the car rental offices Hone your negotiation skills in advance From haggling in souqs to negotiating fares with taxis you hail in the street bargaining is commonplace in Marrakesh Shopkeepers often state an offer and the buyer is expected to negotiate a price they are prepared to pay I say pay what the goods are worth to you You may find the same item cheaper or more expensive elsewhere but is that worth worrying about The art of bargaining over a prices is all part of the Morocco experience Prior to hopping in a cab negotiate a price in advance if the meter is not activated or if it notoriously doesnâ t work The price within Marrakesh city limits shouldnâ t cost more than to US to US if the meter is activated Rates are higher at night â and increase based on distance If the meter does not work negotiate the price in advance and make sure you have small bills and coins to pay the exact amount agreed the amount already includes a tip Opt for street food stalls where locals queue and the food is prepared in front of you Shutterstock Be wise about the street food you eat Some of the best food is served up street side in Marrakesh When deciding where to eat consider how many locals are pulling up a seat to tuck into the local delicacy like msemen pancakes harira soup or a tajine In Djemaa el Fna opt for stalls where the food is prepared in front of you Advertisement Stay current Moroccoâ s Dirham is a closed currency and visitors are permitted to arrive and leave with a maximum of Dirhams US Most ATMs distribute up to US per transaction to a daily maximum of US per bank card though this varies by international bank Most banks will charge a fee For the best currency exchange head to Hotel Ali in Djemaa el Fna or Hotel Farouq on Avenue Hassan II near the train station Dress like a local for a comfortable experience For women I suggest ditching any belly tops and short shorts while wandering in the Marrakesh medina one of the cityâ s most traditional neighborhoods Instead opt for dresses that fall below the knee or trousers and a shirt that covers your shoulders For men knee length shorts or trousers are advised For traversing the cobblestoned and uneven footpaths flats are best ideally close toed Donâ t avoid visiting Marrakesh just because itâ s Ramadan Donâ t put off a trip to Marrakesh during the month of Ramadan It provides an insight into another aspect of this rich culture Locals will expect that visitors will want to eat and drink even while out in public Guides may join you at the table and wonâ t want you to feel guilty about eating or drinking During this holy month it is even more important that you re mindful about alcohol consumption Know your table manners when eating with others in Morocco Chris Griffiths for Lonely Planet Local table manners When accepting a sample of olives or dates in the souqs or sharing a tajine with locals always use and eat with your right hand If invited into a localâ s home arriving with some sweet treats will be graciously received and bakeries â Amoud PÃ tisserie Amandine and CafÃ â are local favorites When it comes to love discretion is key Sexual relations between non married Moroccan men and women are not typically flaunted in public Even though laws around booking a hotel room or self catering apartment with a Moroccan and non Moroccan together have reportedly been relaxed we recommend erring on the side of caution Discretion is recommended when it comes to flaunting oneâ s affection for their partner regardless of nationality or sexual orientation Knowing a few words of Darija will earn you points Though folks working in tourism often speak several languages with English becoming increasingly common learning a few words of Darija Moroccan Arabic will earn respect Walking into a shop itâ s common to greet fellow customers and shopkeepers with an Assalaamu alaykum peace be with you and respond with â Wa alaykum ssalaamâ â Chakrunâ for thank you â La chakrunâ for no thank you and â Afakâ for please are also key Getting a little lost in the Marrakesh medina is to be expected Geoff Stringer for Lonely Planet Problems you may encounter in Marrakesh Stumbling upon a faux guide either on foot in the medina or a man on a bike who claims to work at your hotel with offers to visit the Berber market or another special canâ t miss event may result in being led to a family memberâ s carpet or spice shop A firm but polite â no thank youâ â La chakrunâ is often sufficient as you walk confidently in the direction you plan to go While it may cause frustration getting lost in the Marrakesh medina is part of the fun â until itâ s not If and when this happens remain confident in where youâ re going Ask an older gentleman in the souqs for directions if necessary If engaging a local lad to show the way expect to pay for their assistance that s around US is reasonable Plain clothes police officers roam the medina frequently and are there to help taking tourist concerns seriously A central police station is located in Djemaa el Fna Also note Although Morocco experienced a magnitude seven earthquake in September with the area surrounding Marrakesh heavily hit natural disasters within the city are rare Keep these must have items in your day bag Brushing oneâ s teeth with tap water is not likely to cause any health issues but bottled or filtered water for hydrating is recommended Youâ ll also want to pack hand sanitizer for days spent wandering shopping and eating Always keep a pack of tissues on hand for bathrooms which may not be stocked with toilet paper Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Morocco Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For
