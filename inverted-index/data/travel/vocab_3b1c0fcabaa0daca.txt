library bookstore and terrace cafe serving light snacks Architecture of Musée Yves Saint Laurent Undoubtedly the most thrilling example of contemporary architecture in Marrakesh Musée Yves Saint Laurent rises from a granito base of Moroccan marble and stone draped in a lacework of terracotta bricks The textured arrangement of the bricks is designed to resemble the weft and warp of fabric Step inside and it s a complete contrast with a silky smooth finish intended to complement the exterior like the lining of a couture jacket The museum was designed by Studio KO and was the brainchild of Yves Saint Laurent s partner Pierre Bergé who wanted to create a repository of the fashion designer s work that was profoundly Moroccan To this end the building was designed without external facing windows to emulate Marrakesh s traditional riads The terracotta color of the exterior brickwork mirrors the dominant hue of Morocco s Red City Like a traditional house of the medina internal patios are an integral design feature of the Musée Yves Saint Laurent The first is a striking circular walk through that segues between the museum entrance and internal exhibition spaces Here a series of stained glass windows echoes the work of French artist Henri Matisse who greatly influenced YSL s designs The second patio forms the heart of the building a square chamber covered with zellige colorful geometric mosaic tilework with a giant circular dish that catches the rain The use of green here is significant as it s highly prized in both Amazigh and Islamic cultures Main exhibition at
