history By Mark Guarino November min read Pick a Rust Belt city and you ll likely find a relic from its glory days an abandoned car factory steel plant or manufacturing facility that serves as a reminder of its industrial past more than a half century ago After decades of disuse many of these sites some sprawling up to million square feet are transforming cities including South Bend Indiana and Milwaukee Wisconsin thanks to redevelopment efforts that are offering tourists and residents alike new spaces for galleries restaurants breweries and offices all imbued with a sense of regional history Daniel Shoag an economist at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio says developers are actively scouting these Midwest sites because they tend to be located in desirable locations such as downtown business districts and are championed by local officials who are open to trying new things Typically it can be really hard for a developer to repurpose a site he says But in these cases they re stepping into situations where the local city council is cooperative That s pretty attractive when you need support both financially and politically In Fort Wayne Indiana developer Jeff Kingsbury is in the process of transforming a acre former General Electric plant into Electric Works a multi use building that will encompass entertainment office space a public school and a tech hub He said millennials want to live work and play in dense urban spaces which means sites such as the GE plant have suddenly become desirable because their sheer size can encompass everything new residents need in what will be an hour district The GE plant for example spans million square feet and formerly accommodated a person workforce There s a character to these buildings that cannot be replicated The fact that these have brick facades with high bays and large columns and spacings between columns while that s not suitable for today s manufacturing is ideal for creative office and loft residential
