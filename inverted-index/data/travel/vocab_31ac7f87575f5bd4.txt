Ambohimanga hill is the Rova the fortress palace The walls of the compounds were constructed using cement made from sand shells and egg whites million eggs were required to build the outer wall alone Inside there are two palaces the traditional palace of the all powerful Merina king Andrianampoinimerina and the European styled summer palace of Queen Ranavalona I r constructed by French engineer Jean Laborde in he was thought to be Ranavalona s lover The word palace seems over the top to describe King Andrianampoinimerina s simple wooden hut but palace it was The original was thatched but Jean Laborde replaced the grass roof with more durable wooden tiles in the century The central pole of the hut is made from a single trunk of sacred palisander rosewood which was reportedly carried from the east coast by slaves of whom died in the process The top of the pole is carved to show a pair of women s breasts a symbol of the king s polygamy The king supposedly hid in the rafters when visitors arrived signalling whether the guest was welcome by dropping pebbles onto his wife s head The royal bed is in the sacred northeast corner of the hut and is elevated to indicate the king s superior status The simple furniture is aligned according to astrological rules Behind the hut are the open air baths where the king performed his royal ablutions once a year in the company of his wives and diverse honoured guests Afterwards his bathwater was considered sacred and was delivered to waiting supplicants Next door to King Andrianampoinimerina s hut in a striking style contrast is Queen Ranavalona I s elegant summer palace It s been beautifully restored and has original European style furniture inside The dining room was lined with mirrors which allowed the queen to check that no one was sneakily poisoning her food Ambohimanga is still revered by many Malagasies as a sacred site and you will see offerings zebu horns blood sweets and honey as well as small change at various shrines around the compound where individuals or families have come to invoke royal spirits for luck and fertility Don t disturb these sacred locations and never point at them with your finger
