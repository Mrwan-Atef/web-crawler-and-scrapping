National Geographic Traveller UK Train trips deliver a little slice of effortless adventure whisking travellers from A to B against a backdrop of ever changing landscapes passing beyond the window and with a varied cast of staff and passengers Hop aboard whether you d prefer an uber luxurious service to the base of Peru s Machu Picchu in Peru to rattle on a tea train through the hills of Sri Lanka or to putter along on a rural service through Wales To honour the arrival and departure of the Rocky Mountaineer flags are waved at the platform Photograph by Rebecca Stumpf Rocky Mountaineer US Best for red rocky landscapes alpine views Route Moab Utah to Denver Colorado Journey time Winding and chuntering for miles between Moab and Denver the Rocky Mountaineer offers a magical way to soak up the landscapes of Utah and Colorado from otherworldly red rocks to majestic mountains As the train chases the serpentine Colorado River it passes gargantuan canyons verdant wineries and ghost towns busting with eerie folk tales Life on board is unapologetically luxurious with marshmallow soft armchairs in glass domed observations carriages a menu of locally sourced dishes and smartly dressed staff who are well versed in all the sights along the route Passengers disembark at Glenwood Springs halfway along the route to spend the night in a hotel Two days from Vietnam s Reunification Express runs nearly the whole length of the country Photograph by William Perugini Getty Images Reunification Express Vietnam Best for coast views Route Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City Journey time hours The comings and goings of modern Vietnamese history are intertwined with the arrivals and departures of the North South Railway known as the Reunification Express Built during French colonial rule the line was besieged by guerillas in the First Indochina War contested during the Vietnam War and became a symbol of the reunified country once it reopened in It is often dashingly scenic with a few episodes where the line flirts tantalisingly with the sea The best comes at Hai Van Ocean Cloud Pass where the railway departs the imperial city of Hue bound for a verdant headland Rice paddies and villages segue to uninhabited terrain and sharp mountains with little paradise beaches appearing coquettishly below the track The pass ends when Danang Bay swings into view Seat from US Norient Express Norway Best for fjords Route Bergen to Trondheim Journey time six days Despite Norway s rail network being among the most celebrated in Europe it s never had a luxury service from which to watch the fjords and fells roll past That s set to change this autumn with the launch of the Norient Express a deluxe daytime train where guests overnight at hotels near the line There ll be a dapper bar with William Morris upholstery comfy leather seats and interiors generally awash with mid century Nordic design Attractive though these may be it s more likely that passengers gaze will be fixed on the landscapes beyond the carriage the train will travel the Bergensbanen railway across the snowbound landscapes of the Hardangervidda plateau before striking north from Oslo skirting silvery lakes en route to Trondheim Prices still to be announced Rovos Rail Southern Africa Best for safari Route Cape Town to Dar es Salaam Journey time days The apex predator on African railways is Rovos Rail a legendary luxury service that has been prowling the southern half of the continent since the late Recent excursions have seen services cross the sand dunes of Namibia and the backcountry of Angola but an enduring classic is the night journey from South Africa s Cape Town to Tanzania s Dar es Salaam passing through five countries en route It takes serious willpower for passengers to prize themselves away from the train with plush armchairs in the lounge car multi course dinners in the dining car and compartments with smart upholstery and in some cases little bathtubs But there are scheduled stops at game reserves as well as a chance to disembark at the Zambia Zimbabwe border and feel the spray of Victoria Falls against your skin The highlight comes on the last leg as the train travels the fabled Tazara line a railway that slaloms through Tanzania s Nyerere National Park Here you need only glance up from your pillow to scan the horizon for the beasts of the African bush Compartment from US per person based on two sharing Kandy s station was built in the and retains its vintage feel Photograph by Simon Urwin Ella to Kandy Line Sri Lanka Best for local culture Route Kandy to Ella Journey time around There can be no better way to get from A to B in Sri Lanka s central highlands than on this train The British originally conceived the route and laid its foundations in the gouging tunnels through mountains drenched in waterfalls and fording rivers and gorges with viaducts to transport both tea and people Today the original carriages are long gone but the train remains a lifeline for locals journeying from Kandy into the hills as well as a beloved day out for travellers Cabins have a pleasingly lived in feel people dangle their arms out the windows and legs out the doors as the train helter skelters past tea plantations farming fields and elaborate rural temples stopping at tiny candyfloss coloured stations to pick up hawkers and the odd passenger To take this ride from Kandy to the highland community of Ella is a window into Sri Lanka s wild heart Seat from California Zephyr US Best for history Route Chicago to Emeryville Journey time hours To take a journey on the California Zephyr is to flick through an anthology of American landscapes the spirit level flat plains of the Midwest the snow topped summits of the Rockies the parched canyons and mesas of Utah as well as the Californian foothills But just as importantly Amtrak s most hallowed route provides a window seat on American history and an echo of the days when railroads blazed a trail into the Old West The westbound Zephyr departs Chicago Union Station an obscenely grand neo classical structure on its journey to Emeryville set beside San Francisco Bay Though the Zephyr has existed in some form since its roots go deeper Between central Nevada and Sacramento the train takes the route of the transcontinental railroad that connected the eastern and western networks of the US in the century bounding the republic together Disembark at Sacramento station to see a magnificent mural that commemorates the line s creation Impressions of the modern service will also stay with you eating flat iron steaks in the dining car striking up conversations in the observation area gazing out at desertscapes under moonlight from your carriage Seat from Journeys onboard Dolce Vita Orient Express start and end in Rome Photograph by Alexandr Spatari Getty Images La Dolce Vita Orient Express Italy Best for classic design Route Rome to Rome Journey time Two three days La Dolce Vita is a new luxury train with a difference Rather than channelling the golden age of travel as its peers often do the service takes its cue from the and with mirrored surfaces mid century light fittings and a whiff of a Federico Fellini production It makes its debut this spring with itineraries panning up and down the Italian peninsula one of the most cinematic being the one that links Rome the Venetian lagoon and Portofino on the Ligurian coast Compartment from per person based on two sharing The Ghan train travels for miles north to south across Australia Photograph by Marla Isaac Foreman The Ghan Australia Best for outback wilderness Route Adelaide to Darwin Journey time three days Named after the Afghan Cameleers who set off into the Red Centre in the century to help British colonisers map the continent today s Ghan has no trace of the hardship experienced by those explorers of old Guests are cocooned in luxury as they speed from Adelaide in the south to Darwin in the north A tapestry of ecosystems unfurls on the journey South Australian wine country turns to the dusty desert of Central Australia which shades into tropical landscapes towards the Timor Sea Passengers might spot the odd feral camel likely a descendant of those brought years ago Compartment from A per person based on two sharing Maharajas Express India Best for food Route Delhi to Mumbai Journey time seven days A number of aristocratic luxury trains trundle along Indian rails though most agree that the Maharajas Express is the most lavish of the lot Its Indian Splendour route offers a tasting menu of the subcontinent from the forts of Rajasthan to the cities of Maharashtra and a miniscule on board kitchen cherry picks big flavours from across the country with regional thalis a particular speciality Signature dishes also take their cue from royal banquets of old expect biryanis steamed keema and bharwa bhindi stuffed okra Compartment from US per person based on two sharing Tohoku Shinkansen Japan Best for speed Route Tokyo to Shin Aomori Journey time three hours Japan was the birthplace of high speed rail a story that began in the with the unveiling of the first bullet train and continues today with a web of supersonic lines extending across the archipelago The longest and most epic is the Tohoku Shinkansen which shoots north from Tokyo bound for the volcanic landscapes and snowy forests of the Tohoku region The downside of travelling at is that if you blink you risk missing the views nonetheless keep your eyes peeled for glimpses of Komine Castle at Shirakawa and the leafy streets of the city of Sendai before you draw into the terminus at Shin Aomori Seat from Along the way The Heart of Wales Line train crosses the Cynghordy Viaduct through vast Welsh farmland Photograph by Dominic Vacher Heart of Wales Line UK Best for slow travel Route Craven Arms England to Llanelli Wales Journey time The Heart of Wales Line is sometimes described as a railway line that time forgot a sleepy single track artery that cuts diagonally across the centre of the country clattering over castellated Victorian viaducts and through rustic stations where passengers must flag down services with a hopeful outstretched thumb Railway aficionados ride it for its lo fi charm but holidaymakers too can use it to explore the quiet Cambrian hinterland at speeds rarely exceeding alighting at quaint spa towns like Llandrindod Wells discovering battle scarred castles like those at Dinefwr and Llandovery or setting out on bracing walks in the uplands of Elenydd where the treeless slopes brood over the rails Seat from Cairo to Luxor Egypt Best for the ancient world Route Cairo to Luxor Journey time hours The Nile is Egypt s main highway a green vein running through the desert but it also has a little companion for much of its length A railway line shadows the waterway from its delta at Alexandria down to the great dam at Aswan and is a fine way to get to grips with the ancient civilisations that once flourished along these riverbanks Most visitors choose to travel on an overnight train southbound from Cairo boarding in the city s Ramses Station then dozing off in a bunk as the train trundles into the gathering night Rise early for river views before disembarking at ornate Luxor Railway Station its facade proudly adorned with a golden eagle The Valley of the Kings lies on the opposite shore Berth from US Harz Narrow Gauge Railways Germany Best for steam Route Wernigerode to Brocken Journey time one hour minutes According to legend the Harz Mountains were a favoured gathering place for witches These days covens of trainspotters descend upon the largest narrow gauge network in Germany spellbound by the steam engines that huff and puff about these fairytale forests There are a few routes to choose from but the classic option begins at the market town of Wernigerode itself looking like a setting for a Brothers Grimm tale hauling up the gradients to the summit of the Brocken the Harz s highest peak Once home to a Cold War era listening station the spot offers panoramic views Seat from The Acela Express US Best for US cities Route Boston to Washington Journey time six hours minutes The US lacks the network of intercity express trains found across Europe but it does nonetheless have the Acela a service that shuttles between five of the most magnificent metropolises on the eastern seaboard and serves as a useful way to get a little taste of each Start with a clam chowder at the northern end in Boston then disembark at New York s Pennsylvania Station for a hot dog before pushing south to reach Philadelphia s magnificent art deco Street Station where cheesesteaks are close at hand Baltimore provides a warm up act for the nation s capital Washington DC Tickets have to be bought for individual legs on Acela meaning you d need to buy a fare from Boston to New York and another from New York to Philadelphia and so on to complete the journey Seat from Aboard the Golden Eagle which runs through Central Asia expect lobster for lunch Photograph by Anatoly Boev Golden Eagle Central Asia Best for off the beaten track Route Almaty to Tashkent Journey time days For years the Golden Eagle was the Trans Siberian Express s preeminent luxury train but with Russia currently off limits to many travellers the eagle has flown the nest the train has shuffled off to make other epic journeys elsewhere One of the best of these is the itinerary from Almaty to Tashkent through five of the Central Asian Stans Trains stop to see the Silk Road splendour of Bukhara and Samarkand in Uzbekistan climb to the mountain hemmed shores of Issyk Kul lake in Kyrgyzstan and travel the little travelled rails of Turkmenistan bound for the hellish flaming pit of the Darvaza Gas Crater Interiors are a splendid affair with a baby grand piano tinkling away nightly in the lounge car A long and ultra luxurious journey comes of course with a substantial fare Compartment from per person based on two sharing The ancient Inca citadel Machu Picchu is but one of the stops aboard the Hiram Bingham Photograph by Laurie Chamberlain Getty Images Be greeted by traditional dancers on the platform at Poroy Photograph by Collin Hughes Hiram Bingham Peru Best for open air jungle views Route Cusco to Machu Picchu Journey time The Hiram Bingham a Belmond Train transports passengers in luxury through the Sacred Valley of the Incas to the foothills of Machu Picchu on mile journey that s impossible by road Departing in the morning from Poroy station in the southeastern district of Cusco in Peru the train takes just under four hours to pass through farmland harvested fields and mountains grooved with glaciers On board passengers can indulge in traditional Quechua cuisine and a pisco sour or two while enjoying live music and dancing or simply basking in the sun in the open air observation car as the tracks wind off into the distance From one way El Chepe Mexico Best for mountain traverses Route Creel to Los Mochis Journey time nine hours El Chepe Express Central America is a part of the world sadly deficient in railways but a rare and precious exception is the line officially known as the Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacífico known to most as El Chepe It makes a wild ear popping traverse of the breezy heights of Mexico s Sierra Madre Occidental mountains to reach the town of Los Mochis and the Pacific shore on route passing through tunnels and clattering over bridges looping like a lasso about the arid cliffs of the Copper Canyon The El Chepe Express is the tourist train the local version is its cousin the El Chepe Regional which follows the same route with more stops and in the absence of roads serves as a lifeline for the communities that inhabit this rugged territory Seat from MXN The Bernina Express stops at Alp Grüm station which sits at an elevation of in the Swiss Graubünden Photograph by Stefano Politi Markovina AWL Images Bernina Express Switzerland Best for snowy Alpine landscapes Route Chur to Tirano Journey time four hours Bumbling over a rather modest miles a ride on the Bernina Express may be short but it is filled with unrelenting drama with the little scarlet trains burrowing through tunnels swooping over stone bridges and traversing the great glacier bound barrier of the Bernina Pass It s sublime year round but especially in the depths of winter when drifts rise tall by the lineside and the Rhaetian Bahn carriages are at their cosiest Setting out from the town of Chur you ll soon see icicles clinging to the tall arches of the Landwasser Viaduct Skiers disembark at the midway point St Moritz home of the legendary Cresta Run skeleton course but it s south of this point that trains commence their own hair raising twists and turns A plough is sometimes on hand to clear the way to the highest point at frozen Lago Bianco set at before the tracks begin their switchbacking descent to the balmier climes of the Italian border where snow segues to cypress and palm Look out for the Brusio Spiral Viaduct on the last leg where the line corkscrews in tight turns to lose elevation Seat from Douro Line Portugal Best for wine Route Porto to Pocinho Journey time three hours minutes The Douro Line was first laid in the late century to help transport sweet port wine from the Portuguese hinterland to the drinks cabinets of the world These days it s passengers and not plonk that are transported along these rails but nonetheless a ride along it uncorks some truly vintage landscapes with rows of vines clinging to steep almost fjord like contours The journey starts at Porto s extraordinary São Bento station every surface swathed in dreamy azulejos blue and white ceramic tiles Before long the train is in the Douro Valley proper the current of its namesake river racing below Some of the best wineries can be reached from Pinhao two stops before the end The station is decked out in azulejos depicting the grape harvest and you ll find a bottle shop by the platform Published in the March issue of National Geographic Traveller UK To subscribe to National Geographic
