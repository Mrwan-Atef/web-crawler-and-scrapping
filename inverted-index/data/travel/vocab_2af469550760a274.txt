Jan min read Share Greetings from Ecuador Roving Lonely Planet correspondent and altitude seeker Bailey Freeman recently returned from the highlands of Ecuador She has a few tips for making the most of any trip to this stupendous region Advertisement I am a mountain person through and through since their quiet grandness makes me feel alive in a way that no other environment else can So when I got the chance to visit the Andes of Ecuador I was immediately all in In Ecuador the Andes possess a distinctly fiery energy the range punctuated by volcanic wonders several of them active My journey specifically took me to Andean corridor home to one of Ecuadorâ s most impressive â and active â volcanoes Cotopaxi A tapestry of golden meadows rocky peaks and high altitude sky the region grabbed my heart the minute I saw my first peak It still hasnâ t let go Advertisement Driving in the Ecuadorian Andes I start the day in the Ecuadorian Andes withâ A drive into the mountains We arrived in the Andes straight from Quito climbing to approximately above sea level and putting our altitude tolerance to the test The drive into the mountains is one worth savoring our destination Cotopaxi National Park is ringed by other magnificent volcanoes â Pasochoa RumiÃ awi Antisana and more Hereâ s a spectacular view of Sincholagua as we approached the park Cups of Canelazo In the Ecuadorian Andes you must tryâ Canelazo After a long windy day in the mountains nothing warms the soul quite this delicious hot drink A hacienda staple itâ s associated with hospitality and a warm welcome A delicious combination of cinnamon sugar water tart naranjillo juice and if youâ re feeling feisty aguardiente canelazo tastes like the landscape feels soothing and exciting at the same time The top spot for an epic adventure in the Ecuadorian Andes isâ On top of a horse Iâ m a big hiker and love getting to places by the power of my own two feet but even I canâ t deny how spectacular it was to wander this unbelievable place on horseback Thanks to Tropic Eco Journeys I had the chance to enjoy rolling hills and valleys of Cotopaxi National Park astride my own spunky steed aptly named Tequila We spent an unforgettable afternoon trotting across the high altitude plain together taking in views of wild horses galloping beneath Cotopaxiâ s hulking peak and dramatic clouds gathering among the volcanoes Bailey s accommodation in Ecuador In the Ecuadorian Andes I stayed inâ A cozy hacienda If youâ re staying in Ecuadorâ s Andean highlands haciendas are absolutely the way to go accommodation wise These guesthouses incorporate so many beautiful local touches â a personal fireplace for example will make you feel like youâ ve been taken to a mountain dreamland We stayed at the wonderful Hacienda Porvenir where I spent the night in this adorable loft We also enjoyed lunch at Chilcabamba Mountain Lodge another fantastic option for those looking for a bit of mountain serenity As a souvenir from the Ecuadorian Andes you should bring backâ A sense of awe and gratitude This may sound cheesy but itâ s true To the Kichwa Ecuadorâ s largest Indigenous nation and all those who visit Cotopaxi is the mountain god When translated its name means the â neck of the moonâ â a reference to its crescent shaped crater Standing in its presence is a sacred experience the massive snow capped cone so perfect and huge that it feels like someone dropped it there from another universe Bailey with her Nikon camera in Ecuador The one item I recommend bringing to the Ecuadorian Andes isâ A good camera Itâ s true that the equipment doesnâ t make the photographer but youâ re going to want a tool that will help you capture every texture every color every change in depth My Nikon was my trusty companion even atop Tequila and Iâ ll treasure the photos I snapped for years to come Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Ecuador Let a local expert craft your dream trip
