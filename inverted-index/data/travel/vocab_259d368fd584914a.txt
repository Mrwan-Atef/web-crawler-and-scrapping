Consulting a map before you launch into the labyrinthine Venice streets is always a good idea Â bissun Shutterstock Not many destinations astonish like Venice â the city s staggering beauty and unique setting knows few rivals on the continent or anywhere for that matter Sauntering about Venice s distinctive web of waterways canals and bridges as a family evokes Walt Disney World level marvel and awe around every turn each nook and cranny wowing kids and adults alike So grab the little ones â the magic here is real Advertisement Children absolutely love to ride on a gondola or vaporetto on Venice s canal Â Mike Tauber Getty Images Is Venice good with kids One of the world s most spectacular destinations Venice dazzles all ages â nobody is immune from that instantaneous and unparalelled love at first sight moment when uninitiated eyes spy the city for the first time The city s radical deviation from the typical urban landscape is in and of itself an attraction for kids The endless maze of footbridges and staircases traversing a web of intertwined waterways is one giant playground for the little ones Children love getting around the city The city s fleet of water taxis vaporetti public waterbuses gondolas and private boats insure constant fascination Although Venice does presents its own set of unique challenges parents donâ t need to worry about their kids crossing the street without looking both ways but the constant concern of falling into a canal isn t exactly a welcome trade off Venice is not stroller friendly either with numerous staircases throughout the city making for an exhaustive workout for parents Family friendly public facilities are also limited though parks and playgrounds can be found in a few neighborhoods â Canereggio s Parco Savorgnan and Castello s Parco delle Rimembranze for example While Venice s public toilets do have baby changing facilities you ll need money and good timing to use them Bars and restaurants cannot be counted on for baby friendly bathrooms A portable changing mat for on the go changes wherever there s a flat surface is the way to go The best news for families traveling in Venice is that kids are genuinely welcomed in most cases expect a cheeky wink or a joke with your kids from a restaurant waiter or a knowing smile from a local nonna grandmother when you re carrying everyone s luggage and wondering if you ll make it to your accommodation before you collapse You won t encounter intolerant glares like you can in some less family orientated cultures Stairs feature heavily when walking around Venice so it s best to leave the stroller at home Â Pierluigi Palazzi Shutterstock Where is best in Venice for kids A vaporetto ride along the Grand Canal is fun for the whole family â line runs the complete length from Piazza Roma to Piazza San Marco passing the ornate facades of Venice s most regal palaces along the way Advertisement Head out on a winged Lion of Venice hunt â the city s official symbol since CE is everywhere including Piazza San Marco Alternatively head to the beach Venice s Lido was Europe s first beach resort note reservations are required for free spots Best things to do in Venice with babies and toddlers Pre mobility you can enjoy the city no differently than you could before kids Do consider bringing a baby carrier as strollers can be a real drag in the city Once they re up and at em it should be noted that in lots of places there are no railings For this reason Venice is probably best avoided by families toting toddlers in the early walking stage you know when they are constantly tripping over themselves and or tending toward any direction that isn t the one you want A gondola ride is probably a guaranteed hit if you do bring them at this age but a lack of life vests will turn off some parents If all else fails pop into a gelato shop for a refreshing and delicious ice cream fix Â pixhook Getty Images Best things to do in Venice with younger children Once kids get the walking thing down are more aware and curious of the world around them and more inclined to follow instructions let s call it and up though your mileage may vary options abound Child friendly museums like the Leonardo da Vinci Museum the Natural History Museum and Peggy Guggenheim Collection all feature fun interactive exhibits geared towards younger children the latter also offers Sunday workshops for kids Heading straight to the top of Venice s towers for astounding views â St Mark s Campanile and across the water San Giorgio Tower â are both a surefire good time You might consider a picnic as well Green spaces such as the Giardini Pubblici â created under Napoleon s watch â are full of atmospheric spots for an al fresco meal You could also pick up provisions at a top notch gastronomia gourmet self service deli like establishments like WEnice La Gastronomia Veneziana and head to a nearby campo city square Lastly your kids will love the chance to make their own Venetian disguise Ca Macana offers family oriented workshops for making city s famed Carnevale masks Young children will also gawk in awe at the city s vibrant and colorful Rialto Market Choose your own souvenirs at Venice s many shops and market stalls Â Imgorthand Getty Images Best things to do in Venice with tweens and teenagers Venice is your oyster By this age your offspring will have likely
