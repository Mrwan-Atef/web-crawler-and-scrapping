youâ ll rarely get the same answer Madragoa and Santos are usually bundled together as one neighborhood and no one seems to mind them being referred to as a single place Offices schools pretty cafes with decent and free wi fi a mix of traditional and modern restaurants and the vibe of a typical Lisbon neighborhood are the gist of the Santos Madragoa duo bustling business area by day and quiet residential neighborhood after office hours Fully equipped and furnished short term rental apartments and a cluster of coworking spaces a short walk or train ride away in nearby Cais do SodrÃ and Baixa Chiado have turned Santos and Madragoa into a coveted spot for digital nomads Fairly well served by public transit grocery stores affordable cafes and restaurants itâ s the place to stay for

portuguesa Portuguese cobblestone pavement in Rossio To fully see the contrast between these neighborhoods head to the viewpoint at the top of Arco da Rua Augusta After a morning of sightseeing go window shopping or buy some souvenirs At Baixaâ s main street Rua Augusta youâ ll find traditional stores coexisting with tourist traps overflowing with cheap fridge magnets Rossio is all about big plazas and their statues flanked by overpriced souvenir shops with a few local gems thrown in the mix like the century hattery Azevedo Rua Chiado has the old town charm of historical cafes like A Brasileira and Pastelaria Benard ideal for a break after perusing the upscale shops at Rua Garrett These touristy neighborhoods have Lisbonâ s densest concentration of hotels hostels cafes restaurants

filled with cozy bars and restaurants Kerry Murray for Lonely Planet Right Mouraria has many lookout points with panoramic city views Kerry Murray for Lonely Planet Mouraria and Alfama Best

neighborhoods are the oldest in Lisbon and the heart of the city You ll find top landmarks here including SÃ de Lisboa Museu do Aljube Museu do Teatro Romano Castelo de SÃ o Jorge and PanteÃ o Nacional But the real magic happens as you wander through the cobblestoned streets up and down the hills getting lost amid tiled buildings interior courtyards and pieces of Lisbon s medieval walls Stay here if you want a hint of old town authenticity and donâ t mind tourist crowds and fewer transportation options Both neighborhoods are best explored on foot with the occasional hop onto one of the classic yellow trams to dodge a steeper hill Where to stay Hotel Mundial is located in Mouraria near PraÃ a Martim Moniz and has one of the cityâ s most popular rooftop bars For something a bit different try Patio SÃ o Vicente Guest Houses with independent cottage houses and a private interior courtyard Or go all out at Palacete Chafariz dâ El Rei perhaps Lisbonâ s most beautiful five star

with dinner and bar hopping in Bairro Alto and then head downhill to the nightclubs at Cais do SodrÃ closer to last call usually around Bairro Alto is the more charismatic of the two neighborhoods with patrons gathering outside tiny bars with a drink in hand before heading off to wherever the night leads them In the post democratic revolution of Lisbon this district became the cityâ s bohemian destination where students and artists flocked yearning for the musical and intellectual freedom that thrived here after five decades of a conservative dictatorship Although things have changed a bit since then BA for short is still seen as Lisbon s affordable unpretentious night out spot Further north is PrÃ ncipe Real a fashionable affluent area with great restaurants trendy cafes and sophisticated bars It s leafy with Lisbon s botanical gardens and the romantic Jardim do PrÃ ncipe Real all within its boundaries The neighborhood has become known for its concept stores and design shops too On the other hand Cais do SodrÃ is Lisbon reinvented Once a shabby haunt for on leave sailors cheap and sketchy bars were the norm These days only the old names and decor of those places exist a nod to how that part of the city went from a red light district of sorts to one of Lisbonâ s most popular nightlife districts PensÃ o Amor is the best example of that past and present fusion Where to stay Stay Inn Lisbon Hostel is an affordable hostel with a shared kitchen and eight brightly decorated individual rooms in the center of Bairro Alto Dear Lisbon Gallery House is another handy

neighborhood for families The eastern neighborhood of Parque das NaÃ Ãµes grew around the former grounds of Expo and itâ s the newest part of Lisbon Although the city center is a train or metro trip away it doesnâ t take more than minutes to reach must see attractions The urban park itself is a great playground for kids but the real family friendly gems are the OceanÃ rio de Lisboa one of the

the best neighborhoods in Lisbon for families with big chain hotels concentrated between the park and the Oriente Station the public transit hub for trains metro and buses A good mix of grocery stores
