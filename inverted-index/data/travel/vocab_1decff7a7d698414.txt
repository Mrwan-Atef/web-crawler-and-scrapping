contrast to go go Dubai Abu Dhabi is long on experiences for culture lovers and families Â Valerija Polakovska Shutterstock Itâ s no secret that visitors to the United Arab Emirates associate the country more with sizzling Dubai than stately Abu Dhabi Yet the UAEâ s capital has never been one to chase pizzazz Instead Abu Dhabi has taken initiatives that emphasize heritage and culture as well as family friendly offerings such as theme parks With easy access to beaches mangroves and a gorgeous swathe of desert aptly known as the Empty Quarter thereâ s plenty for nature enthusiasts here too Itâ s true that Abu Dhabi is noticeably conservative especially when compared to Dubai But donâ t let that deter you it doesnâ t take long to realize that the city is as ambitious as it is tradition oriented a mix that leaves newcomers wanting more Advertisement Here are nine canâ t miss experiences that will show you the best of Abu Dhabi The magnificent Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque blends a variety of Islamic architectural influcences Â Christian HÃ cker Soak up the spiritual allure of Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Among Abu Dhabiâ s many architectural wonders none enraptures visitors quite like Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Occupying a site the size of four football fields it can accommodate up to worshippers and hosts millions of visitors every year Despite the footfall a sense of serenity always obtains â a mood accentuated by the lilting call to prayer that reverberates through the air five times a day A team of artisans architects and engineers from across the globe worked on the monument for years producing a monument that fuses Mughal Ottoman and Persian architectural influences Gold leaf spires gilded chandeliers and columns inlaid with precious and semi precious stones like amethyst lend a sense of opulence Visitors can explore the premises solo or with a guide We recommend arriving late in the afternoon when you can linger long enough to see the four minarets and
