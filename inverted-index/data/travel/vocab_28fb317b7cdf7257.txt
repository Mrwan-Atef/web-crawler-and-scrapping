Bazika Feb min read Share Stretch your budget further in Australia with these money saving tips myphotobank com au Shutterstock Australia â with its wallpaper worthy landscapes vibrant cities and unique wildlife â is a dream destination for many Unfortunately while Australia is known to be laid back it is not known as a budget destination Even locals find the cost of living a hard pill to swallow Ultimately how expensive Australia feels will depend on the exchange rate of the Australian dollar with your home currency Whether youâ re in Sydney Perth or an outback location in between food activities and especially accommodation can add up quickly However with careful planning it is possible to keep costs reasonable on a trip to Australia Advertisement Here are our top money saving tips along with a guide to daily costs A guide to daily costs Shared bunk room in a hostel AU US Basic room for two AU US Single fare on public transport AU US Coffee AU US Bacon and egg roll for breakfast AU US A classic Aussie meat pie AU US Dinner per person excluding drinks AU US Beer in pub AU US Cocktail AU US Total average daily cost AU US Plan your trip during the off peak season Australia s peak tourist season falls during the southern hemisphere s summer This makes December to February the most expensive time to visit Australia Consider traveling during the shoulder seasons of spring September to November or autumn March to May instead when you re more likely to score a deal on accommodation domestic flights and even tours As most accommodation providers â particularly in urban centers â rely on dynamic pricing these months are when youâ ll be more likely to find a room for a reasonable price The same is true of seats on domestic flights and tour buses The shoulder season is also a great time to discover offbeat Australian festivals timed to coincide with the changing seasons such as Tasmaniaâ s winter solstice celebration Dark Mofo or cherry picking events in Victoriaâ s Yarra Valley Sydney is not always the cheapest city to fly into Sydney is considered the gateway to Australia but itâ s not the only city with an international airport You might be able to save a chunk of change if you fly directly into Melbourne Brisbane or Perth instead You ll find that domestic airfares within Australia are surprisingly budget friendly although their higher environmental cost also bears consideration One way flights between Melbourne and Sydney retail for as little as AU US if you time it right You can expect a slightly higher level of service and more inclusions when flying with Australiaâ s budget airlines including Jetstar than you may have experienced with low cost carriers in other regions Another money saving option is to consider a flight package Qantas Australia s largest airline often has travel deals that include airfare hotels and car hire You can use its multi city trip planner to budget domestic travel within Australia Diners at the Mindil Beach Sunset Market Oliver Berry for Lonely Planet The cheapest places to eat are markets pubs and food trucks Australia s big cities have top notch restaurants but they can be pricey and are likely to be a stretch too far for budget travelers Instead opt for the lively markets in laneways parks and historic sites Savor street food like Thai and Greek delights at Melbourne s Queen Victoria Market or explore Sydney s Chinatown night markets on Fridays with dishes starting at just AU US Advertisement If you re in regional areas weekends are a treat with farmers markets offering everything from freshly baked pastries and picnic supplies to souvenirs to take home For more wallet friendly dining keep an eye out for food trucks â they re everywhere In Darwin Parap Village Markets serves up some of the best laksa Malaysian noodle soup in Australia while Sydney and Brisbane have a variety of options from Texas BBQ to Filipino fare And if you re in the mood for a classic Aussie meal check out local pubs Most will offer a daily special like a AU US chicken parmigiana or a AU US burger with chips fries Finally before you balk at prices for mains remember that they include tax and tipping isn t customary what you see on the menu is what you pay Windjana Gorge in the Kimberley Philip Schubert Shutterstock Australia s best attractions are free In Australia the real treasures lie outdoors on captivating beaches coastal walks and mountain trails There are over national parks and while a handful charge an entrance fee most are free to explore There are also hundreds of cost free museums and attractions across the country including the Australian Museum in Sydney and the National Gallery of Victoria Some may request donations or provide free entry only during specific hours check online before you go Another option is to join a free walking tour that delves into local history and iconic landmarks In Brisbane volunteers spend two to three hours guiding visitors through the city the Sydney Sights tour leads you around neighborhoods and to famous places like the Sydney Opera House and in Melbourne a Culture Capital tour takes you deep into the cityâ s labyrinth of laneways and arcades While these tours may advertise themselves as free they often run on a tips basis or pay what you think it s worth so keep in mind that guides are usually also expecting a financial contribution for their time and expertise If youâ re having trouble finding a tour ask at an information center or chat with the booking desk or concierge where you re staying Just remember to book your spot for these tours in advance For popular tourist attractions consider investing in a multi attraction combo pass Sightseeing Pass Australia for example offers discounts for attractions in South Australia and Western Australia while Sea Life Sydney â s Pass will save you up to on other nearby sights Alternatively scout for discounts on platforms like Klook Red Balloon and Adrenaline to make the most of your sightseeing adventures A campervan with a view over the Indian Ocean MXW Stock Shutterstock Hire an RV or campervan for cheap accommodation and travel Whether it s a road trip through the outback or along the coast the best and sometimes only way to see Australia is by car To explore efficiently consider hiring a camper instead of a traditional car rental Campervans provide affordable accommodation on wheels with nightly fees at caravan parks averaging around AU US for unpowered sites and upwards of AU US for powered spots although you may find even better deals on private land through Hipcamp There are also free campsites available throughout the country offering an authentic off the beaten path experience These can be found using apps such as WikiCamps Australia and CamperMate If you go this route prepare for minimal amenities some spots lack toilet facilities or access to clean water Van rental costs start at approximately AU US per day depending on the model Camplify which is like Airbnb for motorhomes and vans has an under section making it easy to pick your next home on wheels within budget Jucy Rentals is another option best suited to road trippers on a backpacker budget While youâ ll save on accommodation bear in mind that petrol gas is expensive in Australia Prices fluctuate a liter of fuel was just below AU US in Sydney at the time of writing Get involved with rural life on a farm stay which can be cheaper than the cost of a hotel room AzmanJaka Getty Images Consider a farm stay for a different perspective Australia is witnessing a rise in the popularity of rural farm stays among travelers Whether visiting a region for a month or a weekend you can book a tiny house on a cattle station or sleep in a chic converted shearing shed They can sometimes be cheaper than hotels with a breakfast typically included Most importantly they double as a free attraction for the whole family as many farm stays encourage guests to pet the horses or feed the cows To find them use Hipcamp or Booking com s farm stay filter While some farm stays can be upwards of AU US for a luxe glamping experience some cost less than AU US per night for an entire cottage to yourself Many tourist facing farmstays such as the Tweed s Hosanna Farmstay double as campgrounds with sites from AU US a night and huts from AU US Work or volunteer while you travel A working holiday visa in Australia can be a savvy move to explore Australia s culture and breathtaking scenery while padding your wallet Available for visitors between the ages of and and up to in some cases from eligible countries these visas allow you to work as a tourist in Australia Housesitting is another option for travelers You get to stay for free in great homes across Australia in exchange for looking after the house and possibly pets too while the owners are away Aussie House Sitters and Mindahome com both list available house sits there is a small membership fee to join but itâ ll pay off in accommodation savings if you land a housesitting gig Chinatown in the centre of Melbourne Adam Calaitzis Getty Images Bring your own wine to dinner Australia has steep taxes on alcohol resulting in high prices Expect to pay AU US for a glass of house wine To lessen the blow on your budget opt for happy hour drinks when cocktails are just AU US and tap beers will start at AU US Many places also offer food deals like AU US nachos and AU US fries For a budget friendly dinner with drinks some restaurants â particularly Chinese Italian and Mediterranean ones â will allow you to bring your own bottle of wine This will typically be advertised in the restaurantâ s front window with a nominal corkage fee of around AU US Although if you walk in with a â goonâ bag a four liter bag of wine which will set you back about AU US you might turn some heads Join a group tour A common oversight among travelers is underestimating Australia s vast size With a population of just million its landmass rivals that of the United States Travel times â particularly to remote regions â arenâ t just critical to your itinerary theyâ ll also affect your bottom line This is when group tours â which cover lodging food transportation and experiences â can be particularly good value especially for destinations such as Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park and Kâ gari Fraser Island Tour operators are typically able to negotiate lower group rates for their guests saving you not just time and effort in planning but money as
