Stoller Esto TRAVEL Why it s important to save historic hotels Sure they re fun to visit But these venerable resorts motels and inns also have a lot to teach us about community By Jennifer Barger December min read In the U S economics and atmospherics determine whether colonial inns mid century motels and Gilded Age resorts survive Keeping the doors open and the roof on at such historic hotels drives preservationists but their passion for retaining and repurposing older buildings often runs contrary to the goals of developers and urban planners Conserving a building and a business that s been around for decades even centuries presents more financial structural and historical challenges than throwing up a cookie cutter motel off the highway It s why two mid century hotels made the

marvels fight to survive The National Trust for Historic Preservation NTHP list spotlights grassroots efforts to save endangered older neighborhoods battlefields and lodgings helping to define exactly what historic means along the way We look for places with rich stories that tell the full history of the U S says Katherine Malone France chief preservation officer for NTHP We also want properties that already have local groups working to preserve them Increasingly the hotels preservationists seek to rescue aren t just Victorian palaces like the Grand Hotel on Michigan s Mackinac Island or early American taverns Concord s Colonial Inn in Massachusetts renting rooms since They re remnants of the swinging modernist energy of mid century America including the two on the National Trust s

It can be difficult to convince developers and government grandees to appreciate and to help save some historic structures Mid century architecture with its blocky Brutalist high rises and neon signed Jetsons esque motels can be divisive It s grandmother s wedding dress syndrome Your mom s dress looks frumpy to you but your grandma s is cool says Paul Muller executive director of Cincinnati

space Preservation is not just about sentiment It s about making sure that buildings are put back into service and useful lives says Lolly Rash executive director of the Mississippi Heritage Trust which led the crusade to redevelop not raze the motel A parking lot and a state office building doesn t accomplish that That s not going to bring in people How to save a historic hotel Many historic hotels succeed operating continuously for decades or centuries including the Beekman Arms in Rhinebeck New York open since and yes George Washington slept there or West Virginia s Greenbrier site of a resort since the century with some guest cottages dating to the The secret A blend of nostalgic often romantic atmosphere and no nonsense financials A ghost story or two can also scare up customers Related These are the most haunted places in the U S Many of today s new hotels are just bedroom factories built one on top of the other There s very little patina to them says Carlton Varney the curator interior designer at the Greenbrier The resort is noted both for its Hollywood Regency interiors by the glamorous Dorothy Draper and for its antebellum style architecture So many new resorts are all beige white and gray Places like the Greenbrier still provide layered Kodak moments says Varney To save an older property from the wrecking ball it usually takes a combination of historic landmark designation state local or the National Park Service s National Register of Historic Places preservation advocacy and funding Case in point the Statler Dallas a story skyscraper in the heart of the Texas city s downtown It took three years and million to restore its Mad Men ish Jack Lubin lobby mural upgrade its electrical systems and carve out new hotel rooms and higher floor

marketing at Boston College who researches historic hotels But renovating or running a historic structure can come with tax credits municipal financing and may be a less expensive way to enter a market than building something new From factories to fine lodgings Many historic hotels in the U S and around the world didn t even start their long lives in the hospitality business Older buildings that once served as factories Lancaster Pennsylvania s Cork Factory breweries San Antonio Texas s Hotel Emma or churches New Orleans s Hotel Peter and Paul Washington D C s The Line Hotel were transformed into hotels via what s called adaptive reuse Related Craving a country escape Try an Amish farm stay They re probably the greenest hotels around the ultimate use of recycled products says Larry Horwitz executive vice president of Historic Hotels of America a hotel membership directory linked with the National Trust for Historic Preservation The opposite can happen too says Terrace Plaza Hotel advocate Muller whose thinks converting older hotels to condos or retail complexes also amounts to a preservation win Some things need to be frozen in time and kept exactly as they were like Mount Vernon but other buildings can be adapted says Muller You can get a reverberation and things that anchor you in a long history Keeping a roof on the place Steel beams old growth pine flooring and Jazz Age crown moldings lend historic hotels charm They also cost more to keep up than new construction These older buildings could be quite fantastical complex spaces with towers murals indoor pools and other things that are expensive to maintain says Andrew Scott Johnston professor of architectural history and director of the historic preservation program at the University of Virginia To cover those costs rates to bunk at historic hotels can often be high This means hoteliers need to both harness their property s notable architecture and tangible history but also be sure that the mattresses are comfortable the restaurant is upscale and that the heating system dates from the not the Businesses have to decide if they want guests to think a hotel is old with peeling paint and other problems or have them think it s historic and that some famous figure slept in their bedroom says Hudson When given the choice between something new and something historic if the functional aspects are the same studies show even younger audiences will choose historic says Hudson They want to participate in the past but in a desirable era perhaps a past era of luxury Idealizing bygone eras can lure couples for romantic getaways or meeting planners for conferences It can also create controversy and cultural insensitivity amid the upgraded marble bathrooms and grand old ballrooms Many properties were operating during the racist Jim Crow Green Book era when Black travelers couldn t stay in most U S hotels There s a growing negative reaction to places with plantation
