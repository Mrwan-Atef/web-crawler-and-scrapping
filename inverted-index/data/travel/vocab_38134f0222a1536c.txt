Planet writer in the Steve Waters Jul min read Share Bus from Tashkurgan stopped at Karakul for a photo Xinjiang Â Â Steve Waters Lonely Planet Our Trailblazers series sees Lonely Planet s guidebook writers reflect on past adventures reminisce a little and compare their experiences past and present Here our Melbourne based writer Steve Waters recalls his time researching in China when the country was starting to emerge from isolationism Uighur flat bread stall Kashgar Xinjiang China Oct Â Steve Waters Lonely Planet Advertisement Mostly remembered for bad hair terrible music and the fall of European communism the also witnessed China cast aside its Maoist blinkers and take the first tentative steps towards a market economy With the overland hippie trail shutdown by the Soviet Afghan War independent travellers began trickling north to the Middle Kingdom The breakup of the Soviet Union soon followed neighbouring borders reopened and almost overnight the ancient silk route pathways across Central Asia were re established Once again all roads led to China Chinaâ s historical isolation was in part due to its constraining geographical boundaries â impenetrable mountain ranges inhospitable deserts impassable rivers and pirate laden seas Nowhere is raw geography more evident than the border with Pakistan along the jagged Karakoram Range in wild western Xinjiang The Karakoram Highway to Steve s travel companion Vicky at the top of the Khunjerab Pass China Pakistan border Â Steve Waters Lonely Planet Vicky was having trouble breathing Weâ d left the warmth of the Pakistani at the top of the ice covered Khunjerab Pass to photograph the kitsch dragon topped Chinese welcome arch After long days spent on dodgy local transport hurtling maniacally along an ever more crumbling road perched precariously above raging torrents and rounding treacherous blind corners laden with landslides we were lucky to be here Our ears were ringing either from the sudden altitude gain or the days of incessant distorted Urdu music The torturous switchback down the Pass of Blood to the Pakistani border village of Sost lay behind us Only opened to tourists in there was no better route at the time for aspiring overland travellers We snapped our pics wound on our film and didnâ t tarry China awaited Steve and Vicky at Tianchi Xinjiang Â Steve Waters Lonely Planet The Chinese border post at Pirali a concrete bunker a few kilometres from the top of the pass provided our first taste of Chinese bureaucracy when they charged us for their immigration forms We were also obliged to buy FECs Foreign Exchange Certificates were the official tourist money used for most hotels transport and foreign goods R enminbi RMB literally people s money was used for food and everything else Officially FEC RMB but there was a raging black market offering more lucrative rates Travellers tried all sorts of tricks to pay for things in RMB while the black marketeers tried all sorts of tricks on the travellers â the golden rule always count the RMB yourself before handing over the cash After Pirali our now Chinese bus hit a pothole and lost the back window while our oblivious driver killed the engine and coasted in breezy freefall all the way down to Tashkurgan at a bleak Silk Road outpost The obligatory Transport Hotel TH â buses didnâ t travel overnight in Xinjiang then â had one bed dormitory and two squalid toilets Advertisement Clockwise Wuzhou Canton Ferry Steve and a friend on an express train to Chengdu Steve in Class on the Yangtze River somewhere between Wuhu and Chongqing Dec Â Steve Waters Lonely Planet Chinese people dealt with long journeys by alternatively sleeping and eating Any refuse â cigarettes peanut shells sunflower seeds tea leaves spit vomit or baby piss went straight onto the floor regardless of whether you were on a bus train or boat beware the bottom bunk Everyone smoked in China in the On one forgettable slow boat trip up the Yangtze River in the middle of winter we alternated between asphyxiating in the smoke filled class dormitory awash with the above refuse and freezing to death outside Attempts to self anaesthetise by sculling bottles of sweet Chinese wine sealing Help â please rescue notes into the empties before flinging them over the side invariably failed A deeply uncomfortable seat somewhere between Emei Shan and Jinjiang Note the ice on the edge of the door Â Steve Waters Lonely Planet The incredible scenery of southern Xinjiang unfolded the next day the mammoth peaks of Muztagh Ata and Kongur Shan dwarfed the road and Kyrghiz nomads and Bactrian camels lounged by Kara Kul Fabled Kashgar with its colourful inscrutable Uighurs still in the majority was less of a culture shock than the Han Chinese dominated cities yet to come with their drab Mao jacketed staring squads obstructive ticket sellers and outwardly hostile hotel staff In Kashgar it was the tourists who gawked travelling in packs and wielding zoom lenses like targeting lasers around the already popular Sunday Market As perfectly final as a Russian nyet mÃ i yÇ u was the first phrase every traveller learnt Applied equally to a request for a room a beer or a bus ticket to Lhasa it roughly translated as donâ t have though was more commonly understood as no not now not for you not ever Learning numbers and key phrases in Mandarin was a necessity for while a ticket request for jÄ n tiÄ n today might provoke a mÃ i yÇ u one for ming tiÄ n tomorrow might not Restaurants were easier you simply walked into the kitchen and pointed at ingredients Naxi market Old Town Lijiang Yunnan Â Steve Waters Lonely Planet To be fair life in the for the average Chinese person wasnâ t easy The excesses of the Cultural Revolution were still a recent memory there was almost no middle class and they had to fight for everything or miss out If westerners found buying travel tickets an ordeal the Chinese had to deal with it every day Internal tourism was not encouraged and strangely attired foreigners with no understanding of the language or local customs were indeed a curiosity Personal space was unknown and nobody had a problem with staring at foreigners or at each other A year later in a small town in Xishuangbanna I witnessed a crowd of people gathered outside a building staring in the window A student explained â a woman inside was giving birth We stood in the freezing Kashgar gloom at wondering if our bus was running on official Beijing or local Xinjiang behind time The bus left when it was full four hours later with the wind howling through the glassless door Alternatively frozen then sandblasted it took us three days to cross the Taklamaklan Desert weathering constant breakdowns overnighting in spartan THs and arriving in Turpan magnificently dust covered Bai fisherman Erhai Lake Dali Yunnan Â Steve Waters Lonely Planet Crossing the Kazakh border nine years later after weeks travelling through bleak Central Asian â stans still recovering from their collective communist hangovers we found that FECs Mao suits and Transport Hotels had been replaced by thriving private enterprise day glo nylon fashions and sleeper buses A rapidly expanding economy fuelled a growing middle class Internet cafes were everywhere After months of grey greasy mutton Chinese food was a taste sensation The Taklamaklan was still an adventure even sleeper buses broke down though no longer a three day epic Alas the kitsch dragon arch on the Khunjerab Pass was gone Days on a hard sleeper train brought us to Beijing in the a sleepy city of massive grey Soviet era buildings and wide avenues serenaded by bicycle bells Narrow hutongs alleys led to informal markets hidden temples and calligraphy shops while the whole city lay cloaked in a charcoal burner funk Private vehicle ownership was non existent and foreigners could only stay in several designated hotels the infamous Qiao Yuan was the budget favourite Fast forward ten years and the hutongs and bicycles were already disappearing making way for futuristic hotels shopping malls and a concentrically expanding ring road system catering for a newly insatiable appetite for cars By the time the Olympics reached Beijing in the city had a word class subway system and world class air pollution and traffic congestion Clockwise Chinese Immigration checkpoint at Shenzhen Uighur flat bread stall Kashgar Xinjiang The author settling the bill at the legendary Peteâ s cafe Lijiang Â Steve Waters Lonely Planet Every trip I made to Beijing between and astounded me more with the cityâ s progress from dour Maoist past to world leading century megacity While it was once easy to distinguish Overseas Chinese from mainlanders by simply looking at their clothes by the end of the millennium the latest fashions and mobile phones were just as prevalent on Wangfujing as they were in Causeway Bay or Tokyo English was more widely spoken and the people far more friendly helpful affluent and relaxed Yunnan had a laid back reputation among travellers due to its milder climate and large number of ethnic minorities Daliâ s old town on Erhai Lake in the Bai Autonomous Region was a favourite hangout to eat wok pizza and explore the neighbouring villages Under the gaze of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain picture postcard Lijiang was home to the matriarchal Naxi and close to the forbidden Zhongdian route to Tibet Every traveller purchased a piece of Dali tie dye or Naxi calligraphy However by the late growing internal tourism markedly changed the once tranquil picturesque villages as new airports hotels and shopping malls rapidly proliferated Chinese double entry visa for Central Asian trip Khunjerab Pass revisited Â Steve Waters Lonely Planet We took a sporting route from banana pancake capital Yangshuo already a backpacker magnet by bus to Wuzhou with writhing sacks bound for Cantonâ s markets then overnight ferry to Guangzhou At the train station the lucky got jÄ n tiÄ n reservations for Shenzhen the rest just stormed on board anyway We now exercised our perfected mÃ i yÇ u ruthlessly Thankfully it was a non stop express Clearing Shenzhen customs we crossed the bridge to Hong Kongâ s sparkling Lo Wu KCR station The KCR trains were spotless nobody was coughing spitting staring or shelling peanuts onto the floor Someone remarked wow itâ s not like China This effect soon wore off after paying a fortune for a mouldy room in Kowloonâ s notorious Chunking Mansions beer was more expensive than on the mainland and the only place we could afford to eat was McDonalds We almost missed the staring Trailblazers Trekking in East Africa as a Lonely Planet writer in the To follow your own road to China check out Lonely Planetâ s China Travel Guide
