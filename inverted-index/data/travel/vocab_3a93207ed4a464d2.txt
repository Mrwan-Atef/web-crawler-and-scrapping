Photograph by Christina Anzenberger Fink Redux TRAVEL INTELLIGENT TRAVEL Discover Italy s Aperitivo Capital By Paul Abercrombie February min read To most of us vermouth is the stuff you use to make a Martini Or a Manhattan Fair enough But as many of us are rediscovering vermouth is among the most versatile of cocktail ingredients What s more it s great straight Vermouth s origins as with most quaffs are hazy But evidence unearthed in China suggests it just may be the oldest alcoholic beverage in the world No matter its provenance the apéritif was likely first developed for medicinal purposes says Adam Ford author of a book on the spirit Folks found that botanical remedies often foul tasting were more palatable when mixed with wine Over the years better ingredients and recipes would transform vermouth into less a treatment than a genuine if pricey treat But it wasn t until that the aromatized vino got the attention it deserved when Italian distiller Antonio Benedetto Carpano produced a version that combined higher quality wine with less expensive herbs and spices Carpano really created the first commercially viable vermouth Ford says Carpano s home base of Turin Torino would become something of the world capital of vermouth as local rival vermouth makers emerged and improved their offerings including iconic brands such as Martini and Cinzano Vermouth had finally become cool Soon after it was being mixed with other booze and voila cocktail culture was born The Americano cocktail first known as the Milano Torino because its main ingredients Campari and sweet vermouth came from those cities was what really kicked off Italian cocktail culture explains Jacob Briars global brand advocacy director of Bacardi which has owned Martini Rossi since Related

Basso accidentally used spumante sparkling wine instead of gin when mixing up a Negroni The result was an instant hit and it s easy to see why The Negroni Sbagliato is a lovely drink Though traditionalists old school producers such as Contratto Martini and Cocchi have even begun concocting new recipes To celebrate their anniversary several years ago Martini master herbalist Ivano Tonutti and his colleagues cooked up Gran Lusso a limited edition vermouth inspired by a recipe unearthed in the company s archives During a visit then to Martini s headquarters just outside of Turin in Pessione I had a chance to meet Tonutti and share a glass of this richly aromatic vermouth served over ice with twists of lemon We wanted to create something completely unique in the vermouth world he
