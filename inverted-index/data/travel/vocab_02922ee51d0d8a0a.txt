streets of Bermuda refreshingly quiet Â larigan Patricia Hamilton Getty Images On the holiday island of Bermuda cars are regulated to one per household and car rental is non existent So for many the best way to get around is by moped which helps to contribute to the leisurely pace of life on the island The lack of urgency here is part of the appeal Most visit to kick back on sandy beaches splash in crystal waters and wander around the pastel colored streets of Bermuda s tiny towns on warm summer evenings But if you do need to get from A to B â or golden beach to golden beach â there are buses taxis boats and bicycles to get you there Here is how to get around Bermuda Advertisement Renting a motorcycle or moped is the most convenient option for travelers who are comfortable with the rules of the road in Bermuda Â anouchka Getty Images Explore Bermuda by motorcycle or moped With motorcycle shops stationed throughout the island renting a motorcycle or moped is probably the most convenient option for travelers who are comfortable with the islandâ s road rules For those not used to roundabouts and driving on the left however there are some safety concerns as you ll have minimal protection between you and other drivers or worse the pavement On the flip side motorcycles and scooters are a great option for zipping around without having to worry about finding somewhere to park and they re ideal for navigating the winding narrow streets of the island s townships like a local You can visit a rental shop to pick up your vehicle or arrange delivery to your hotel either way make sure youâ re comfortable on the moped before taking off on your own You must be at least years old and present a valid driverâ s license from your home country Go beach hopping by Twizy A portmanteau of twin and easy the Twizy is a two seat electric vehicle that can travel up to miles on a single charge With a little more protection than a moped but a similarly compact size these vehicles are increasingly popular for visitors who feel more comfortable behind a steering wheel Hamilton Princess Beach Club has the widest selection of Twizys which are typically rented out on a first come first served basis You must be at least with a valid driverâ s license from your home country Be sure to drink lots of water if you bike around Bermuda Â Glowimages Getty Images Exploring by e bike or bicycle While we re talking electric vehicles Bermuda also rents out e bikes both from cycle and moped rental shops and from hotels Electric bicycles are a great alternative to scooters and Twizys for navigating downtown Hamilton or traveling between hotels and the beach and as an added perk theyâ re emission free Advertisement Regular bicycles pedal bikes are also available if youâ re seeking some exercise on vacation Due to Bermudaâ s summer heat be sure to apply plenty of sunscreen and bring sufficient water to stay hydrated on longer routes Navigate Bermuda by bus Bermudaâ s pastel pink and blue buses are an important means of transport for islanders and riding on these colorful coaches is considered a tourist attraction by many visitors â and a cheap one at that There are bus routes on the island connecting the downtown Central Terminal on Washington St in Hamilton to the west and east ends of the island or as locals know them Somerset and St George s Visitors can use exact change to pay for bus rides single tickets cost to or purchase a one to seven day Transportation Pass allowing unlimited use of the islandâ s public transport system Most services run between and though a few services run until Services are less frequent at weekends particularly on Sundays Catching a ferry is a great way to explore the island of Bermuda Â Onepony Getty Images iStockphoto Ferries offer scenic transfers along the coast There are four ferry routes around Bermuda with three starting from the central ferry terminal on Front St in downtown Hamilton Taking the ferry is a breezy and picturesque way to traverse the island and there are great views from the sea towards the Bermudian coast Ferries connect Hamilton to Rockaway Dockyard and Salt Kettle with other stops en route and there s a connecting service from Dockyard to St George s Depending on the time of day this can be a quicker way to reach the far ends of the island than traveling by road If youâ re worried about windswept hair head for the covered portions of the boat and youâ ll arrive looking as fresh as when you boarded Unlike the bus the ferry doesnâ t accept change so youâ ll have to use your Transportation Pass or visit the terminal prior to boarding to purchase a ticket or token using cash or a card Taxis and rideshares are handy for day trips Bermuda taxi drivers also double as tour guides for visitors to the island If you form a quick bond with your driver from the airport you might end up using the same driver for your entire stay There are several taxi companies and rides are metered at government rates Taxis can be in short supply at busy times so make an advance booking for your trip to the airport when you depart Bermuda also has its own rideshare service Hitch which uses a similar platform to Uber or Lyft but relies on the existing taxi drivers on the island rather than freelancers The application allows users to order a taxi on demand or schedule a pick up rather than relying on hotels and other venues to call a driver With a private taxi you can easily explore Bermuda s natural wonders Â Getty Images Glowimages RF Walking is a good way to explore Hamilton For locals who live close to downtown Hamilton walking is the obvious route to work but for visitors traveling by foot isnâ t always the quickest option nor the safest given the narrow roads and lack of sidewalks However it s definitely the best way to tour Hamiltonâ s city center Save the bicycles and mopeds for longer trips â strolling from local boutique to pub at your own pace in the tropical sunshine was partly why you came to Bermuda You can also walk along the mile Railway Trail which follows the route of Bermuda s vanished railway line for a scenic nature walk around the island Accessible travel in Bermuda Some attractions restaurants sidewalks and pubs are wheelchair accessible as are the fast ferries but roads are narrow and the lack of sidewalks is an obstacle for wheelchair users and the visually impaired Some hotels have rooms that cater to mobility impaired guests Public buses however are not equipped for wheelchair access and there are only a few taxis that can accommodate wheelchairs The Bermuda Physically Handicapped Association has useful info for disabled travelers For more information see Lonely Planet s Accessible Travel Resources page
