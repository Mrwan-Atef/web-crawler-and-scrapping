Pack trips in the Wyoming wilderness offer a deep connection to nature TRAVEL Looking for room to roam Try a pack trip Horseback journeys in the Wyoming wilderness offer a deep connection to nature Riders and horses thread their way through a blanket of wildflowers during a pack trip in Wyoming s Gros Ventre Range By Matt Stirn Photographs by Matt Stirn July min read I snapped awake in my sleeping bag as the day s first light set fire to the granite peaks above our campsite Deep in Wyoming s Wind River Range the air was frosty as I unzipped my tent and crawled outside Across a meadow vibrant with wildflowers I saw our horses look up from their morning graze Breakfast is ready my dad called Heath our guide and a true Wyoming cowboy handed me a tin cup of coffee and a plate of eggs and grilled trout that we had caught the day before On this third morning of our weeklong wilderness pack trip we had no pressing plans and our only task was to watch the sun rising over the mountains We would need the energy later in the day we would hike to see a glacier along the Continental Divide The history of pack trips in the United States can be traced to the early century when explorers and trappers ventured west into the uncharted territory of the Rocky Mountains Small strings of mules and horses were employed to help lessen the burden of carrying heavy equipment and supplies across great distances Nowadays pack trips continue to offer a travel experience that nods to the past but instead of supporting intrepid expeditions into unexplored country they provide camping adventures in remote mountain locations where comfortable canvas tents solar showers and gourmet meals are the norm Days are spent exploring the stunning landscapes fishing in mountain lakes and watching wild animals roam the high alpine terrain In the evening dinner is cooked over campfires as the Milky Way prepares for a superlative nighttime show In a world where the pace of daily life is ever faster and our interactions increasingly virtual pack trips offer a chance to apply the brakes and reconnect with family friends and nature A fly fisher angles for an elusive golden trout at a high altitude lake in Wyoming s Wind River Range Pack trips allow easier access to remote places that would take considerable time and effort to reach on foot Slowing it down In National Geographic conducted a survey of people regarding travel styles and outlooks for future vacations The results showed an increased preference for trips that are sustainable and foster rich connections with places and cultures A similar study conducted by the Adventure Travel Trade Association ATTA echoed this perspective Recent data shows that slow and immersive travel is on the rise says Shannon Stowell CEO of the ATTA The days of packing on to a bus to hop off snap a picture and get back on feel antiquated it has always been the preference for adventure travel companies to provide one of a kind experiences with people wildlife or nature The growing concept of slow travel parallels the popular slow food movement and encourages meaningful connections with places people nature and oneself through sustainable and environmentally conscious experiences Rather than focusing on the itinerary of a particular journey slow travel advocates for a change in mindset that brings emotional cultural and even physical benefits Such a mantra allows for its doctrines to be applied just as easily in a nearby town as across the sea Opting for a homestay in place of a hotel exploring the history of an unfamiliar neighborhood or venturing into the wilderness are all examples of slow travel Adding nature into the equation seems to boost the benefits even more Related Discover how nature affects your

closed to motorized travel Tory Taylor an author and outfitter of years regularly seeks out the healing power of the natural world on horseback The rhythms of wilderness are slow and soothing he says The drumming plod of horses hooves sets a calming cadence During the coronavirus pandemic air travel and hotel stays have plummeted and international tourism is at a near standstill Outdoor recreation has become the go to experience We are seeing that people are interested in longer trips right now says Peter Linn a third generation outfitter in Wyoming They want to slow down and enjoy a different pace instead of seeing multiple national parks in a single weekend he says Pack trips are providing an opportunity for anyone to enjoy that feeling even if they aren t hardened outdoors people Taking the reins In the western United States outfitters offer pack trips that range from short overnights to multiweek expeditions and they often can cater to specific interests such as hiking fishing or wildlife watching Spring and summer bring warm weather and wildflowers and sometimes mosquitoes while fall is more conducive to spotting wildlife Related Explore gaucho culture at Patagonia s horse
