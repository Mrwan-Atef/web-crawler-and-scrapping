Frazzetta By Aimee Long February The sweet smell of citrus hangs heavy in the air and while that might bring memories of warmth and sunshine to mind for many for Ivreans it conjures up visions of mayhem soaring oranges and the camaraderie of friends Every Carnival season the charming Italian village of Ivrea tucked in the foothills of the Alps becomes a battleground The city s population swells by the thousands comprised of visitors and the infamous aranceri orange throwers who are here for one thing to wage war with flying fruit Eager crowds gather to witness the action as hundreds of citrus projectiles cloud the sky The Carnevale di Ivrea is a multi layered blend of history and legend that plays out over four days Taking place in either February or March depending on when Lent falls the festivities are an unforgettable mix of parades ceremonial fires regional cuisine and plenty of vin brulé to fuel the fun Related Is La Tomatina a waste of food The folkloric origins of Carnevale di Ivrea The origins of the Carnevale di Ivrea are a murky mixture of legend and history Orange throwers battle in the name of Violetta a medieval miller s daughter and folkloric protagonist According to organizers at the Fondazione dello Storico Carnevale di Ivrea local lore states that a notorious tyrant issued a prima nocta the right to a bride s bed on Violetta s wedding night Rather than succumb to his evil ways she proceeded to get the feudal lord drunk severed his head while he slept and presented it triumphantly to the townspeople inciting a revolt The Tuchini team prepares for the Battle of the Oranges in the historic Borghetto neighborhood The crow emblem on the back of their jackets is the symbol of Croatia because Croatians lived in Ivrea long ago Photograph by Andrea Frazzetta Whether the rebellion against the tyrant and the medieval heroine was fact or fiction Ivreans celebrate it all the same even electing a modern day Violetta each year Presented to the town on Carnival Saturday she ll make appearances throughout the festivities throwing candy in parades and watching over the celebrations However customs have evolved over the centuries with most of the festival s historic elements and traditions added later including lobbing oranges which didn t begin until after WWII Generally speaking the medieval origins claimed for such festivals as this are legendary and lack medieval documentation many are later inventions says Professor Daniel Bornstein who specializes in the religious culture of medieval Italy at the Washington University of Saint Louis While the tale of Violetta might be a myth Bornstein does add that Ivrea s historic brawls could be rooted in fact There were certainly occasional riots and factional street fighting in medieval cities with whatever lay at hand used as a weapon Battle of the Oranges For three days from Carnival Sunday to Shrove Tuesday the aranceri will fight to the last peel starting at p m each day Known formally as the Battle of the Oranges or Battaglio delle Arance in Italian these friendly conflicts occur in designated piazzas and streets throughout the city Nine groups of aranceri on foot distinguished by their colorful uniforms and unique emblems fling oranges one by one at horse drawn carriages full of armored men who represent the tyrant and his guardsmen Sourced from Sicily and other regions of Southern Italy it s estimated that over tons of oranges will be thrown throughout the festival People wait in Piazza di Città Ivrea s main square for the ceremony of the burning of the scarli bonfires of poles covered with heather and juniper This is one of the rituals that concludes the city s long carnival celebration Photograph by Andrea Frazzetta In the Aranceri or Battle of the Oranges Team Morte Death challenges the carriages in Piazza di Città Photograph by Andrea Frazzetta Unlike La Tomatina and its soft and squishy tomatoes the oranges at Carnevale di Ivrea pack a meaner punch Revelers will undoubtedly walk away with bloody noses sometimes worse but it s all a part of the fun As painful as it is and it really hurts I am aware of what I m doing and how to protect myself in unpleasant situations says local photographer Alessio Ferreri who has been attending the Carnevale di Ivrea since he was just three years old But he digresses There are also many places to stay safe and fully enjoy the show Spectators watch from balconies behind nets and anywhere else that provides a safe haven to witness the scene unfold and keep them protected from a rogue orange Donning a crimson Phrygian cap representing Ivrea s freedom from tyranny will help the aranceri know you aren t a target By the end of the third day of battle a thick ochre paste of orange peel and pulp carpeted Ivrea s medieval squares and cobblestoned lanes Like the city itself the aranceri will smell like citrus for days if not weeks something that Milanese photojournalist Vittorio Sciosia remembers well The smell of oranges that spreads through the city s air lingers for days even after the event ends But not only that the scent stays on you for days even after taking a shower he says But the Carnevale di Ivrea isn t just a booze fueled slightly masochistic homage to a medieval heroine it s become a part of Ivrean identity While the orange throwing is visually stunning especially when the light filters through the squares the intensity in some of the gazes I ve captured across all ages is unforgettable says Ferreri People truly care about the Carnevale about experiencing it fully and passing down this passion Related of the best Italian Carnivals beyond Venice from north to south Symbolic Carnevale di Ivrea rituals and traditions Recognized as an Italian

everyone to lay down their oranges and come together in peace People gather around There s a sense of community in the air and in the coolness of the night the fire warms us all together says Ferreri describing the burning of the scarli as the festival s most important tradition Depending on how the scarlo burns and falls it s seen as a sign of good or bad luck for the coming year It s a beautiful moment to be together warmed by a living flame in the middle of Ivrea s squares on a cold night Even the festival s final words tell how deeply these annual traditions are felt Arvedse a giobia a n
