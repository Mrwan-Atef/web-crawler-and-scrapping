Lonely Planet Writer Apr min read Share Step away from the tourist crowds in Italy with these lesser visited spots for a summer vacation including the port city of Genoa Roman Sigaev Shutterstock There is no doubting the charm of Italy When Italians are in need of a holiday they usually head to the mountains or sun kissed coasts to cool down Here six Lonely Planet writers reveal the Italian destinations where they escape in summer to enjoy simple pleasures like swimming hiking good food and cultural sites without the crowds Summer cityscape of Bacoli town and Miseno lake Italy Andrew Mayovskyy Shutterstock Campi Flegrei Virginia DiGaetano is a Lonely Planet writer living in Rome where she devises excuses to return to Naples without making it look too obvious Advertisement Why Campi Flegrei This cluster of towns west of Naples is truly magical I was lucky enough to spend a lot of time here researching the upcoming Naples Pompeii the Amalfi Coast guide and I loved it so much that I spent my summer there Locals are so proud of Campi Flegrei and theyâ ll go out of their way to make you feel welcome Thereâ s a real sense of community and family it feels like coming home Campi Flegrei is famous for the unique seismic phenomenon called bradyseism a constant flow of magma underneath the surface that moves the ground like waves Iâ ve felt many tremors there but each town is prepared and every local is an expert so I know Iâ m in good hands Must do activity Everyone needs to visit the Baia Sommersa to see perfectly preserved Roman villas in the worldâ s only underwater archaeological park You can book a trip with Centro Sub Campi Flegrei and either go snorkeling or scuba diving depending on how close you want to get Once you finish head over to the Castello Aragonese di Baia now an archaeological museum full of treasures pulled out of the sea Where to stay I fell in love with the small yet lively town of Bacoli Cala Moresca has rooms and suites looking out over the Bay of Naples Ischia and Procida For a quick break head to Hotel Villa Avellino in Pozzuoli steps from the train station and overlooking charming Rione Terra Where to eat In Bacoli the brilliant family run Sciardac has the best sandwiches cheeses and conversation For a sit down meal Garibaldi is epic make sure to get the signature Linguini alla Garibaldi Pozzuoli is also home to Mar Limone one of my favorite casual restaurants with incredible food and great local beer and wine Panoramic view of Genoa s port in summer day Sergii Figurnyi Shutterstock Genoa Kevin Raub is an American Lonely Planet guidebook author living in Bologna Why Genova Authenticity Italyâ s overtouristed locales are nearly intolerable in terms of maintaining authenticity but this former maritime republic is an unheralded underdog The historic port s medieval center is a rich tapestry of dense streets and caruggi â narrow medieval Ligurian alleyways â awash in port life excellent gastronomy centuries old merchants sex workers transients and artisans Itâ s a real deal Italian city that knows nothing of catering to moneyed tourists Must do activity Hunt down the worldâ s greatest pesto which is nothing like what you get at home or in a supermarket Eating your way through the cityâ s storied trattorias in search of your favorite is pure unrivaled culinary joy I also simply love getting lost in the historic center where domineering buildings instill a sense of claustrophobia often blocking the light from above The resulting darkness only adds to the cityâ s enigmatic appeal Where to stay Iâ m a big fan of Hotel Nuvole a meticulously restored residenza d epoca residences that have existed for at least years and its sister property Palazzo Grillo both in the heart of the old town The latter features an incredible lobby staircase blanketed in grotesque style frescoes by Bergamasco that feel like sleeping in a museum Where to eat I love the harder to find preparation mandilli de Saea thin layered sheets of pasta piled over one another and slathered in pesto often on special at La Cantina Clandestina For Genovaâ s celebrated focaccia seek out Antico Forno della Casana tucked away in a narrow alleyway try the Recco cheese version Advertisement Serapo Beach at Gaeta Lazio Italy essevu Shutterstock Gaeta Federica Bocco is a journalist travel writer and Lonely Planet guidebook author based in Italy Why Gaeta I have the privilege to live in Rome but there are many things I miss from Naples the place I was raised including the sea and the peopleâ s warmth Somehow I found both halfway through my two cities in the beach town of Gaeta While administratively part of Latium Gaeta exhudes unmistaken Campania energy The sea is splendid the seafood delicious and locals here speak Neapolitan and support the Napoli soccer team Itâ s almost like being home Must do activity My safe option for a low stakes time in Gaeta is to spend a day on the beach â I usually relax the moment my toes touch the warm sand of the scenic Serapo shore Looming over the beach is Gaetaâ s iconic landmark Montagna Spaccata perfect for a short hike According to legend the rock split when Jesus died A steep path through narrow staircases will bring you to a small church and sea facing balcony incastonated in the rock The view always takes my breah away Where to stay I recommend staying in Gaeta Vecchia the medieval part of town edged between the sea and the Castello Angioino fort that dominates the scene from the hill From the four star Hotel Gajeta you can stroll along the seafront on Lungomare Giovanni Caboto and enjoy beautiful sunsets on the sea Where to eat The place I always want to have my first meal in Gaeta is comeilmare for uber fresh fish that still tastes like the sea Casual vibe open air and partly under a canopy it has the quality of a fine dining restaurant but feels like fast food as you order at the counter and get called when your dishes are ready In addition to the many cruditÃ and pasta options try their signature Votapiatto battered and fried squid Castelnuovo di Garfagnana with Rocca Ariostesca Ariosto s Castle in the background Eddy Galeotti Shutterstock Garfagnana Tuscany Angelo Zinna is a Lonely Planet guidebook author from Florence Tuscany Why Garfagnana Known for its vineyard covered rolling hills Renaissance treasures and medieval hamlets Tuscany attracts millions each year Still few visitors seem to be aware that in addition to art wine and photogenic countryside vistas the region features a chain of rugged peaks where great hiking opportunities await The area known as Garfagnana in northern Tuscany is home to the Parco Regionale delle Alpi Apuane a marble rich nature reserve crisscrossed by steep remote trails that locals love to tackle on weekends Must do activity Climbing up Monte Tambura or â along the historic Via Vandelli route that once connected the cities of Modena and Massa â requires some stamina but at the summit youâ ll be rewarded by spectacular views of both the Mediterranean coast and the Apennines which divide Tuscany from Emilia Romagna Where to stay At the many farm stays surrounding Castelnuovo di Garfagnana you can taste chestnut and mushroom based local specialties You can also stay in one of the rifugi mountain huts within the parkâ s borders for a full immersion in the wilderness Where to eat If you do get up Monte Tambura be sure to stop for lunch at the sun kissed Rifugio Nello Conti or run by the outdoor aficionados of the Italian Alpine Club Walking in Otra Valley Valsesia Cesare Re Universal Images Group Getty Images Valsesia Piedmont Benedetta Geddo is a writer from Turin Piedmont Why Valsesia One of my favorite regions for a mountain vacation in Italy is Valsesia located in the northernmost part of the province of Vercelli in Piedmont It follows the course of the Sesia River and is under the shadow of the Monte Rosa the second highest peak of the Alps which means youâ re surrounded by stunning views wherever you look Must do activity Whether you come for an outdoorsy summer holiday with hiking biking and water sports or a snow filled winter getaway at one of the stations of the Monterosa ski area in winter Valsesia offers a gentle relaxing pace The charming town of Varallo has many amenities including restaurants bars a riverside beach an art gallery and Sacro Monte di Varallo a medieval monastery complex and UNESCO World Heritage Site Where to stay For something even more laid back stop in the smaller village of Alagna Valsesiaâ s hamlet of Pedemonte famous for its vineyards and consider a stay in a typical Valsesian building such as at Albergo Montagna di Luce Where to eat If staying in Varallo check out the quiet Al Vicolo del Gallo hotel Enjoy local cuisine at restaurants like Piane Belle and unwind with a drink and a view in Alagna Valsesiaâ s bars Two of my favorites include Il Baretto and La Miacceria Montalbano Elicona and Aeolian Islands in the background Marco Crupi Shutterstock Northeast Sicily Sara Mostaccio is a translator and writer from Riposto Sicily who contributed to the Lonely Planet Sicily guide Why Northeast Sicily Northeast Sicily offers an excellent range of mountains medieval villages and gorgeous beaches all within easy driving distance This less touristed corner of Sicily is centered around the Nebrodi Mountains Must do activity During the summer I love hiking in Sicily â s Bosco di Malabotta a beautiful natural area with a lot of charm I usually base myself in Montalbano Elicona a delightful medieval village overlooked by a Swabian Aragonese castle I love wandering the villageâ s narrow streets discovering little churches and baroque doorways along the way For beach days drive minutes north to Tindari on the Tyrrhenian coast Here you ll find the stunning Marinello lakes and beach reserve with crystal clear waters perfect for swimming From the Santuario della Madonna del Tindar i perched high on a rock you can enjoy a spectacular view of the lakes Nearby you can explore the well preserved ruins of ancient Tindari with its impressive Greek theater which stands out as a reminder of the islandâ s rich history Where to stay In Montalbano Elicona La Casetta nel Borno is a cozy guesthouse within the medieval center with countryside views It s centrally located close to the castle and main square Where to eat One of my favorite places to eat in Montalbano Elicona is Il Ritrovo dei Re a homely restaurant where I often indulge in baked pasta
