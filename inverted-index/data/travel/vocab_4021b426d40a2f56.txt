explorers who traveled between the plains and Santa Fe Speculation that gold was hiding under the sand attracted droves of miners in the and centuries By the operations had sprung up along the seasonal Medano Creek at the eastern base of the dunes alarming residents of the nearby Alamosa and Monte Vista communities Members of the Ladies Philanthropic Educational Organization lobbied politicians to protect the landmark and in it was designated a national monument Seventy years later it was discovered that a large inland lake once covered the San Luis Valley but had dried up due to climate change Residents again rallied to protect the local resource wildlife and unique ecosystems and the area was expanded into a national park and preserve in Today more than half a million visitors flock to the region annually to gawk at and play on the vast mountains of sand framed by the low grasslands and high reaching Sangre de Cristo peaks The tallest sand dunes in North America are nestled among diverse ecosystems of wetlands grasslands forests and a towering mountain range where visitors can fish alpine lakes walk among wildflowers listen to songbirds and climb the soft sand in a single day Pronghorn elk and bighorn sheep call the area home while sandhill cranes flood the area twice a year during spring and fall migrations From star designs to sharp defined edges the shapes of the dunes are as disparate as the geography surrounding them Warmed by the sun or coated in snow the sand hills which tower as high as feet offer opportunities for sledding or climbing year round Adding to the awe of the unusual landscape avalanches of sand can create a rare humming sound that inspired Bing Crosby s musical hit The Singing Sands of Alamosa Intrigue and inspiration
