Philippines is the world s third worst plastic polluter according to a report from the University of Georgia It s third only to Indonesia second and China first producing approximately million of metric tons of plastic each year But it s hoping to get ahead of the problem by testing roads built from recycled plastic Companies like San Miguel Corporation SMC the Philippines largest company and Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc are using plastic scraps to power cement plants and build roads A pilot site from SMC was unveiled in General Trias Cavite at the end of last year According to a statement from SMC the company used over sachets and plastic bags for asphalt on the sq metre road that will be used to carry trucks with heavy loads The plastic waste scraps reportedly act as a binder for the production of asphalt and according to Dow SMC s technology partner company it can make roads more durable compared to conventional asphalt We want to create a sustainable use for waste plastics so that they donâ t end up in landfills and our rivers and oceans â San Miguel President Ramon Ang said The Philippines plastic problem is a byproduct of poverty Around of the population lives below the national poverty line according to a report from the World Bank And about one in five of the country s million people lives in extreme poverty getting by on less than a day For many it s relatively cheap to purchase small portions of everyday items like shampoo milk coffee and sauce in single use plastic sachets which are everywhere in the Philippines A study from environmental non profit GAIA estimates that around billion of these sachets are used every year which works out at million a day What s more the Philippines like many communities in South East Asia has become a dumping ground for
