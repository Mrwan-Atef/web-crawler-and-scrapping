First class all the way Exemplary coordination from arrival to departure Special thanks to Lu at the Dive Center I hadn t gone diving in over years Went through the reactivate dive with her son and daughter in law She ensured in the most professional and caring of ways that we all were well equipped for our open water dive but particularly focused on me She made it very comfortable to get back into to the water as I really felt I could completely trust her Our open water dive was amazing with her leading the dive but again Lu payed close attention to me Also excellent was Mohammed the service attendant for the villa my wife and I stayed at Place was disinfected organized and spotless every day Faisel and Caterina were our primary contacts Wow Made our trip flawless Such personalized service was appreciated If you are going to the Maldives the Conrad will not disappoint Really all the staff members clearly worked as a team but delivering a personalized premium luxury experience Family memories for a lifetime Unbelievably Disappointed Paid A LOT of money for my extended family of to enjoy Ruthâ s country dinner When we arrived there was NOWHERE for us to sit There were seats we were able to find different tables and nothing else The man who was to be singing performing offered to disassemble a display table card table and gather some random chairs to accommodate some of my family which was super nice but I felt like there should have been enough proper seating options for us The girl setting things up was also so apologetic and tried to help best she could while my teenagers stood holding their plates and ate standing up I went strait to the front desk where I was told I might find Julie who I was told was in charge of these dinner reservations The girls there gave me Julieâ s business card with a cell phone and other contact info I texted her and got an auto response letting me know that they had received my message and would be in touch That was days ago and still no contact from Julie or anybody for that matterâ when I arrived back at the venue someone had set up a table for my family in the blistering sun to leave space for entertainment in the little left shade with enough chairs and a proper table cover I went to serve myself and there was maybe about a four of a cup of corn left and NO dessert left except watermelon Just over all a huge disappointment and for the money I paid just completely unacceptable App Privacy The developer Tripadvisor indicated that the appâ s privacy practices may include
