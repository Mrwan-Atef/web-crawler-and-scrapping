Where to eat in Chicago beyond the restaurants from The Bear View of Chicago and the Lake Michigan shoreline Photograph by Anthony Larosa Getty Images TRAVEL A culinary guide to Chicago beyond The Bear From deep dish pizza to Michelin starred tasting menus this is a city that caters to all comers By Aimee Levitt June min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Chicago has been called many things the great American city the Windy City the second city And although the latter was intended as an insult when New York based writer A J Liebling penned it in a travelogue Chicagoans have embraced the epithet if only to disprove it by showing their city is second to none especially when it comes to dining Perched on the southern shore of Lake Michigan Chicago has access to so much fresh produce that farm to table isn t so much a novelty but more an expectation particularly at high end restaurants Over the past two decades the most interesting of these have moved from the central business district known as the Loop to the former industrial area now called the West Loop Here on weekend evenings diners wander the likes of Randolph and Fulton Streets stopping for cocktails while they wait for their tables Yet Chicago as the cliche goes is a city of neighbourhoods and some of its best and most beloved restaurants are located in residential areas away from downtown Many of them share a deliberate lack of snobbishness and a willingness to mix fine and casual dining Michelin starred Kasama for instance is a cafe in West Town that serves exceptional pastries and breakfasts by day and a course Filipino inspired tasting menu by night Meanwhile Moody Tongue in Bronzeville serves as both an elegant experimental restaurant and a brewery As with many major American cities Chicago has been shaped by immigrants as well as arrivals from elsewhere in the US Deep dish pizza is a beloved local speciality which of course evolved from the Italian version but there s much more besides The city has one of the largest Mexican populations in the country and in areas such as Pilsen and Little Village good birria a meaty stew tacos and carnitas slow cooked pork are never far away Puerto Rican immigrants in Humboldt Park meanwhile invented the jibarito a sandwich typically containing meat salad and aioli with fried green plantains instead of bread It s now one of the city s signature foods The city s Greek Americans popularised gyros spit roasted lamb and beef in pitta bread And black migrants from the Deep South developed mild sauce a mildly spiced blend of barbecue sauce ketchup and hot sauce that s a key accompaniment to the fried chicken served at rival chains Harold s and Uncle Remus While Chicagoans might disagree over where to get the best chicken one opinion isn t up for debate this city however you look at it is first rate for food A day in Hyde Park Seven miles south of downtown squeezed between Washington Park and Lake Michigan Hyde Park is a gateway to Chicago s South Side dominated by the spires and squares of the University of Chicago Start your day with breakfast at Plein Air Cafe on the U of C as it s known campus where options include pastries and coffee breakfast sandwiches and burritos and mascarpone stuffed French toast Spend the rest of the morning exploring the university particularly the Seminary Co op Bookstore and its less scholarly sibling Street Books Other attractions include the Frank Lloyd Wright designed Robie House and the Oriental Institute a small museum with a wonderful collection of Near Eastern artifacts Grab lunch at Medici on a cosy neighbourhood institution with great burgers then head east towards the lakefront If the weather allows admire the views of Lake Michigan from Promontory Point or ramble through the gardens woods and meadows of Jackson Park before stopping for a pick me up at Build Coffee a cafe that doubles as a community hub If you d rather stay inside visit the Museum of Science and Industry which contains among other things a chicken hatchery a coal mine simulator and vintage aircraft In the evening walk up to Street for drinks and dinner at Virtue Restaurant Bar where chef Erick Williams menu is based on traditional Black American cuisine Don t miss the blackened catfish cornbread with honey butter or fried green tomatoes topped with shrimp remoulade End the day as generations of South Siders have done with a drink at the Woodlawn Tap known to locals as Jimmy s after its founder Prime rib tartare with egg salad and potato chips at Virtue PHOTOGRAPH BY VIRTUE A day in Logan Square Avondale Logan Square a sprawling residential enclave on the Northwest Side emerged in the noughties as the epicentre of Chicago s food scene which has since expanded into neighbouring Avondale The major streets are lined not just with restaurants bars and cafes but urban farms breweries and coffee roasters plus a weekly farmers market between June and October Begin with a very early lunch at Honey Butter Fried Chicken an Avondale favourite that s open from and celebrated not just for its eponymous signature dish but also its mac and cheese If that doesn t appeal try TriBecca s Sandwich Shop offering deliciously overstuffed Midwestern sandwiches such as the horseshoe an open faced burger covered in fries and cheese sauce For a sweet finish try one of the doughnuts in inventive flavours such as chocolate and French fries Hire a kayak from Wateriders Chicago and spend a few hours paddling along the Chicago River a journey through parks and woodlands that will make you forget you re in the middle of a big city Afterwards explore Logan Square with its gorgeous century homes or the shopping strip of Milwaukee Avenue including Bric a Brac Records Collectibles a trove of memorabilia and Adornment Theory a jewellery shop that stocks pieces created by women and people of colour Stop for a drink perhaps at Quality Time a casual neighbourhood bar that serves excellent cocktails along with handmade tamales Then for dinner pay a visit to Mi Tocaya Antojería where chef Diana Dávila Boldin puts her own stamp on traditional Mexican dishes including duck carnitas enchiladas and an exceptional steak burrito Alternatively check out Lula Café a welcoming spot serving a creative farm to table menu End the day by picking up an ice cream pop at Pretty Cool Ice Cream on your way to knock over a few pins at Fireside Bowl or to settle in on a stool at Rosa s Lounge to listen to some Chicago blues Open kitchen at Mi Tocaya PHOTOGRAPH BY MARISA KLUG MORATAYA Pizzerias Lou Malnati s Lou Malnati is sometimes given credit for inventing Chicago s famed deep dish pizza above back in when he was a cook at Uno s the original deep dish restaurant Whatever the truth Malnati put a new spin on the form when he opened his own place by adding a buttery crust and a sausage patty covering the entire pizza Lou Malnati s now has dozens of branches across Chicago and beyond Pequod s Pequod s specialises in pan pizza which has a thicker and chewier crust than deep dish What makes it a cult classic among Chicago pizza lovers is the extra sprinkling of mozzarella between the crust and the pan which creates a ring of caramelised cheese around the edge The story behind Chicago deep dish pizza Vito Nick s While deep dish gets most of the attention from visitors Chicagoans tend to only eat it occasionally Usually most turn to crispy thin crust cut into squares Each neighbourhood has its favourite but Vito Nick s has the pull to draw visitors from all over the city to the far South Side Chicago s famed deep dish pizza PHOTOGRAPH BY ALAMY Hot dog stands Chicago s strict food handling codes mean street food such as hot dogs has had to move inside usually to tiny counter service restaurants At first there was no seating for customers hence the term stand but now most have stools or plastic booths An authentic Chicago dog consists of a Vienna beef frank sausage either boiled or charred on a grill topped with mustard onions pickle relish a dill pickle tomatoes sport peppers a type of hot pepper and a dash of celery salt all served in a steamed poppyseed bun Ketchup is strongly discouraged Chicagoans argue it ruins the balance of flavours Find an excellent specimen at The Wiener s Circle also famous for its sharp witted counterwomen who insult rude late night customers At some stands notably Jim s Original you can find Polish sausage spicy kielbasa topped with grilled onions and mustard And don t miss the Italian beef sandwich a Chicago classic comprising thin sliced spicy roast beef covered in giardiniera a pickled relish and dipped in jus It was allegedly invented and definitely perfected at Al s
