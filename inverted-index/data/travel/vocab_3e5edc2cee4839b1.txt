sunbathing and swimming are indeed fabulous in Malta â yet thereâ s much to do in the cooler months too Jaroslav Moravcik Shutterstock Renowned as one of Europeâ s sunniest destinations the islands that make up Malta are indeed an ideal place for a vacation filled with swims and lying out for hours Advertisement In the middle of the Mediterranean Sea â miles south of Sicily and miles east of Tunisia â the diminutive but mighty country has been a tourism mainstay for generations thanks to its annual days of sun This reputation however brings crowds of holiday makers digital nomads and English language students all of whom naturally drive the prices up in the peak summer months And yet there is an appeal to this archipelago in every season Visiting in the shoulder seasons of early spring or late fall as well as in the off season of winter provides travelers with better temperatures for hiking rock climbing cycling and taking in the islandsâ natural beauty as well as more comfortable temperatures for exploring the astonishing prehistoric temples here Bottom line Malta is much more than a beach destination and our season by season breakdown will help you know what to expect whatever time of year you visit The bright yet cool days of spring make for ideal hiking weather Shutterstock Spring is the best time for sightseeing and hiking Malta and Gozo are home to some of the oldest temples in the world as well as a wealth of stunning coastal trails to hike Springâ s sunny but relatively cool days make for the best moments to experience both The weather is bright and comparatively fresh from March to May with maximum highs of â C â F You wonâ t need to worry about getting scorched when visiting Maltaâ s impressive temples the oldest and best preserved being the limestone wonder Ä agar Qim and its smaller neighbor Mnajdra Archeologists have dated the monuments to as far back as BCE and suggested that the island s prehistoric inhabitants built them to worship the sun and mark the changing seasons Advertisement Hiking the wildly scenic loops and paths along Maltaâ s coast â in particular the Dingli Cliffs and Fawwara Trail â is also best done at this time of year before the summer heat sizzles Spring also brings Easter ceremonies which the Maltese take very seriously Week long celebrations include parades markets and local bakers selling figolli sweet almond filled cakes shaped like lambs or bunnies Festivals take place after dark in villages all over Malta in summer â and invariably feature a procession music street food and fireworks Renata Apanaviciene Shutterstock Summer is the best time for evening festivals Maltese summers get hot Very hot with highs of â C â F and up to humidity From June until late September is the best time to visit Malta and Gozoâ s excellent beaches by day itâ s really too sweaty to consider doing anything else â then head to a festival of local festa once the sun has set International music festivals take place all season long Produced by the music network every year since Isle of MTV brings huge pop acts to Floriana â with all tickets free Glitch Festival has been inviting EDM artists to the island since Film festivals like Kinemastic short films and Mediterrane Film Festival features also run through the summer Festa season truly reflects Maltese culture with each village town and city in producing its own event The settlementâ s patron saint is inevitably celebrated every year with a procession food market and fireworks display the latter of which get very competitive from town to town Since thereâ s a festa happening somewhere pretty much every weekend look up where if youâ re visiting in the summer months Youâ re guaranteed a brilliant view In the sunny but not brutally hot fall you can both enjoy the beach and the stone monuments of cities like Mdina Matthew Mirabelli for Lonely Planet Fall is the best time for perfect weather The best weather in Malta arrives in mid September and lasts until late October when the days are still long and sun drenched but the peak summer heat begins to break This means you can hit the beach and dive into the still mild Mediterranean â while also managing some sightseeing without melting Wandering the picturesque lanes of Mdina visiting the Roman ruins of a villa in Rabat taking in Neolithic temples like Tarxien and the subterranean Hypogeum or hopping on a boat to Comino or the Blue Lagoon wonâ t leave you lobster red still donâ t forget the SPF Our favorite swim spots in Malta include St Peterâ s Pool look out for Leli and his diving dog Sliemaâ s salt pans Ghar Lapsi near Ä aÄ ar Qim the golden terracotta sands of Ramla Bay and the natural phenomenon of Gozoâ s Inland Sea Still on islands as small as Malta and Gozo youâ re never far from a wonderful spot for jumping into the sea wherever you find yourself Visiting in the winter off season means fewer people packing Vallettaâ s historic streets Shutterstock Winter is the best time for budget travelers The November to February period is the archipelagoâ s off season with January and February being the rainiest months This also makes them the greenest ones The winter months are the most affordable time in Malta too with good deals on accommodation Hostels and Airbnbs whose prices spike in the summer now considered May to October become accessible options â sometimes even bargains â in the cooler period Winter also is a great time of year for outdoor pursuits like hiking rock climbing and even scuba diving You can take the plunge all year long here with an impressive number of shipwrecks close to land such as HMS Maori near Valletta Visibility is generally very good â unless thereâ s a storm of course Advertisement Advertisement
