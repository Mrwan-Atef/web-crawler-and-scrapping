Jamaica with our guide to the island s transportation Â Debbie Ann Powell Shutterstock There are so many natural and cultural treasures dotted all over the island of Jamaica that it s no wonder visitors continue to come back years after their first trip Whether you want to bounce from beach to beach in search of your perfect stretch of sand or learn more about Jamaica s rich history every corner of this Caribbean jewel has something new to offer So how do you make your way around to find them all Luckily there are numerous ways to travel the beautiful island of Jamaica from buses and cabs to hiring your own wheels Hereâ s are our top transportation tips Public transport is made up of buses route taxis and motorbikes Jamaicaâ s public transport system consists of a network of buses and cabs that link towns large and small across the island JUTC bus is the national bus system that is found in the major cities of Kingston and Montego Bay Coaster buses form the wider bus network in Jamaica often filling gaps where JUTC buses donâ t go Advertisement There is however no set timetable or schedule for when they arrive â you just have to embrace island time and wait for the next departure on average you can expect to catch a bus or taxi within to minutes Most major towns have designated bus parks or transport centers There are two types of cabs or taxis in Jamaica charter taxis and route taxis Route taxis run like buses and are the much cheaper of the two with a fare only slightly higher than the bus Operated by taxi companies chartered cabs are more expensive You call ahead to book charter a cab with the fare set by the company before your ride arrives In some towns including Negril motorbikes are a popular form of public transport They act like route taxis and take passengers to and from specific points around the town Ready to go to Jamaica Here are the top island experiences The buses don t run to a set timetable in Jamaica so be flexible with your plans Â Getty Images iStockphoto Carry cash to pay public transport fares There is usually a conductor on the buses who collects fares from each passenger Either wait for the conductor to request all fares in cash at once or pay just before you exit at your stop You can pay with cash or purchase a top up transport card at various spots islandwide Advertisement If you take a taxi whether a charter cab or a route taxi you pay your fare at the end of your journey in cash Public transport in Jamaica is relatively safe and affordable Remember to always board public transport at main bus parks or terminals be careful at night and make sure you have cash in small denominations rather than larger bills For route taxis avoid taking empty cars Solo women travelers may also want to avoid cars when men are the only other passengers Uber is available in limited cities Uber does operate in Jamaica but itâ s not as widespread as in many other countries Drivers are concentrated in cities like Kingston and Montego Bay Keep in mind that where there is Uber coverage itâ s certain there will be a cheaper bus or taxi option If you want to explore the island renting your own vehicle gives you the most flexibility Â Debbie Ann Powell Shutterstock Driving is the best way to get around in Jamaica While you donâ t need a car to travel around Jamaica thanks to public transport options your own ride will be far more convenient and comfortable for visiting the island s best places Roads are well connected and easily navigated by car All major towns have paved roads albeit with varying degrees of potholes Any foreign visitor should remember two essential tenets of driving here â everyone drives on the left and motorists especially taxi and bus drivers are more aggressive on the road than you may be used to and use a â defensiveâ driving style Most reputable car rental companies offer unlimited mileage but unfortunately prices in Jamaica are among the highest in the Caribbean Youâ ll find both established local companies like Island Car Rentals alongside international players like Hertz and Avis at the airport Private buses and drivers are available to hire If you donâ t want to take the wheel yourself you can charter a car and driver for your trip best arranged through your accommodation Another option is the Knutsford Express an extremely popular and affordable private bus service that connects major towns and tourist spots across the island Be inspired to hit the road in Jamaica with our guide to the island s top driving routes Sights are quite spread out in Jamaica so walking long distances is not recommended Â Jupiterimages Getty Images Even a short walk may not be worth taking Jamaica is not a particularly walkable country with major towns or points of interest quite spread out For example the minute walk from Liguanea to Half Way Tree in Kingston is challenging in the blazing Caribbean heat with security concerns to factor in when walking at night Public transportation is not accessible in Jamaica While many hotels parks cruise ports and buildings across the country can accommodate wheelchair users and people with mobility issues there are unfortunately few accessibility options related to transportation The best option is usually pre booking a charter taxi or a private tour to get around the island On public transportation accessibility is extremely limited with buses unable to accommodate passengers in wheelchairs Even if youâ re able to get on the bus there are almost no designated areas for your wheelchair The rapid speed at which route taxis load and unload with passengers makes it very challenging for persons with accessibility needs Some charter taxi companies however can provide accessible options mention your specific requirements when you arrange the ride to ensure they send an appropriate vehicle Additionally some private tours provide accessible transport options with tourist attractions around the island welcoming visitors with accessibility needs to varying degrees Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address
