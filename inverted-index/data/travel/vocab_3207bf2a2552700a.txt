Kerry Murray for Lonely Planet When it comes to beautiful villages and petite towns Portugal scores a perfect â and theyâ re found practically everywhere Stuck in time schist hamlets hide in the folds of forested mountains cinematic clusters of whitewashed homes crown coastal cliffs and if you venture toward the Spanish border it wonâ t take long to spy a hilltop medieval townlet From the northâ s handsome vine hemmed villages to the southâ s fetching fishing communities the list of Portugalâ s most striking villages could easily hit triple digits Weâ ve whittled it down to some of our all time favorites where youâ ll find not only photogenic streets and spectacular natural scenes but also a window into Portugalâ s time honored rural soul Ã bidos Estremadura Best medieval walled town for a Lisbon day trip Cute as a button and loved for serving cherry liquor in chocolate cups Ã bidos is a crowd pleaser bragging a complete list of fairytale hilltop town credentials fully intact Moorish walls royalty commissioned churches and a storybook castle Youâ ll fall under a medieval spell the second you step through the azulejo adorned Porta da Vila entrance But the charm comes with a compromise As one of the most popular day trips from Lisbon the town can often be crowded and a little touristy So plan to arrive later and stay overnight to experience the best of Ã bidos Walking atop the walls at sunset is dreamy sleeping in the castle now a pousada open only to guests is enchanting and after dark snagging a seat in the ginjinha cherry liquor bars along the Rua Direita isnâ t a chore Advertisement Local tip Time your visit around one of the town s many festivals Marchâ s International Chocolate Festival Julyâ s all encompassing Middle Ages Mercado Medieval or the International Literature Festival â Ã bidos is a UNESCO City of Literature â in September or October Monsanto is close to the border with Spain RolfSt Getty Images Monsanto The Beiras Best village for storybook medieval marvels Monsanto was once awarded the title of the most beautiful Portuguese village by the government but this hilltop hamlet is far from ordinary Giant granite boulders balance precariously atop stone dwellings the walls and clock tower rise like a pop up medieval storybook tapered cobblestone streets squeeze through rocky crevices and fortresslike castle ruins with sweeping views of the parched golden plain crown it all Prepare your camera to work overtime â itâ s so cinematic that parts of House of the Dragon were filmed here One of central Portugalâ s designated Aldeias de Portugal Historical Villages of Portugal Monsanto is magnificent but miniature â you could see it all in two hours Stick around to watch the sunset at Miradouro do Forno and sleep in a typical stone home to experience all of Monsantoâ s moonlit magic Local tip The Aldeias de Portugal could pack this list but the Roman settlement of Idanaha a Velha just downhill from Monsanto Belmonte s Sephardic Jewish history swoon worthy o and the hydrangea lined streets of Trancoso are especially enchanting The village of Castelo Novo offers complimentary EV rentals reservations open three months ahead allowing travelers to string a handful of aldeias together on a sustainable two day road trip Left The seawater pool at Azenhas do Mar T Ilsanker Shutterstock Right Adobe Stock Azenhas do Mar Sintra Best village for a post Sintra swim or sunset Dainty but dazzling Azenhas do Mar on Sintra â s scenic coast is little more than a cluster of whitewashed terracotta roofed homes cascading down a wave lashed cliff Below the Atlantic Ocean bubbles onto a pint sized beach spilling over a concrete barrier to fill a seawater swimming pool There are no museums or attractions and only a trio of dining spots but the views Impeccable Make a beeline to the Miradouro das Azenhas do Mar for that postcard perfect â wowâ before descending the staircase to the beach where a soundtrack of rolling waves provides a respite from the crowds at Sintraâ s palaces Monsaraz Alice D Shutterstock Monsaraz The Alentejo Best hilltop town for stargazing By day Monsaraz is everything you could ever want from a hilltop medieval town cobblestones threading between whitewashed abodes an undersized castle standing guard and the Alentjoâ s famed food and wine in no short supply Taverna os TemplÃ rios delivers excellent plates and panoramas But itâ s when Monsaraz is bathed in a golden hour glow and you climb the castleâ s walls to peek at the endless plains and the vast artificial Alqueva Lake that youâ ll fall head over heels for this fortified frontier town Just donâ t disappear with the daylight â the worldâ s first starlight destination is nearby and you can snag a front row seat to the constellations at the observatory Local tip Reguengos de Monsaraz a small city usually has more affordable accommodations However if you want to stay in the medieval village donâ t confuse them â they are a minute drive apart Advertisement Left A leather artisan in MÃ rtola Juan Antonio Orihuela Shutterstock Right MÃ rtola Luis Pedro Fonseca Shutterstock MÃ rtola The Alentejo Best town for Moorish heritage Hugging the left bank of the Rio Guadiana MÃ rtola bundles all of The Alentejo â s laid back allure into its weathered walls Between the regionâ s signature whitewashed homes hemmed in mustard and cerulean and the imposing century castle thereâ s no shortage of camera friendly corners To capture all its river rising glory walk the relaxed MTL trail kayak downstream or go easy with a panoramic lunch at Casa Amarela More than just one of Portugalâ s prettiest towns MÃ rtola has been a key trading post for millennia Trace its history at Museu IslÃ mico which displays Moorish pottery and ceramics walk through a former Roman dwelling and see both epochs come together at the AlcÃ Ã ova dig a once buried Moorish neighborhood with Roman mosaics below Local tip Spring and autumn are the best times to visit the Alentejo to avoid the scorching summers Every other May odd numbered years the Islamic Festival revives the townâ s heritage Talasnal Shutterstock Talasnal Serra da LousÃ Best village for offbeat mountain trails Scattered across the mountainous hinterlands of central Portugal the Aldeias do Xisto â a network of schist a type of rock villages â are some of the countryâ s most tranquil bolt holes The subjectively prettiest is century Talasnal a ridge perched hamlet surveying the deer roamed dense woodlands of the Serra da LousÃ range Strolling between the stone homes many of which are now vacation rentals especially when the hydrangeas bloom feels like rolling back the clock a few hundred years One of my favorite local getaways the Serra da LousÃ counts some of Portugalâ s finest forested hikes and stargazing to make your heart sing On warm days thereâ s nothing better than taking a dip in the nearby river beach before devouring regional mountain dishes like chanfana goat stew or javali wild boar at reservation recommended Burgo da LousÃ Local tip The Serra da LousÃ is reachable on public transport using the Metro Mondego bus from Coimbra From LousÃ itâ s a minute taxi to Talasnal or you can loop around the four hour trail to visit a couple of schist villages Left Castelo de SÃ o JoÃ o do Arade in Ferragudo Sam Tanno Shutterstock Right Ferragudo harbor Serhiy Stakhnyk Shutterstock Ferragudo The Algarve Best fishing village for a beach break The Algarve has no shortage of beautiful beach towns but it s in Ferragudo a centuries old fishing village where youâ ll still find southern Portugalâ s old school charm in droves In the harbor colorful boats bob fishers fix their nets and fresh seafood is grilled quayside Just behind a teeny tangle of bougainvillea veiled streets rise to a quaint church And fronting it all is a sandy estuary beach split in two by a privately owned but extremely photogenic castle Feeling cultured Master making azulejos hand painted ceramic tiles at Arti Arte Azulejar or tour one of the regionâ s only sardine canning factories at Conserveira do Arade Make the most of Ferragudoâ s harbor by taking a boat trip up the Rio Arade to castle crowned winery heavy Silves or by sailing into the deep blue to spot dolphins with marine biologists Local tip The Caminho dos cliff trail links Ferragudo with the equally lovely Carvoeiro From there the Algarveâ s best coastal hike the Percurso dos Sete Vales Suspensos continues to the skylight illuminated Benagil Caves Porto da Cruz zedspider Shutterstock Porto da Cruz Madeira Best village for awe inspiring ocean contemplation When you first glimpse Porto da Cruz itâ s impossible not to gasp This spellbinding village on Madeira â s wetter wilder north coast encapsulates everything that makes this Atlantic island so delightfully dramatic Penha d Ã guia an imposing rock formation towers above the humble hamlet waves pound the bay and lush mountains creep around the edges harboring some of Madeiraâ s famed hiking trails Sure the clutch of buildings alone might not make it one of Portugalâ s prettiest villages but Mother Nature has done all the heavy lifting here Prefer to take it easy Prop yourself at the beach bar at Praia da Alagoa and sample a poncha the islandâ s signature sugar cane cocktail Left Sistelo Diogo Varajao Shutterstock Right Sistelo s famous terraces LuisPortugal Shutterstock Sistelo The Minho Best village for hushed walking and cycling paths Few villages in Portugal laud a landscape as gloriously good looking as scarcely populated Sistelo Spilling down a mountain slope layered with socalcos the verdant agricultural terraces used for growing corn the village has even earned the nickname Little Portuguese Tibet Tucked away on the edge of Parque Nacional da Peneda GerÃªs in the unapologetically green northern Minho this is somewhere you come to find serenity Everything is blissfully unhurried and the valleyâ s trails and the excellent bike friendly EcoVia do Vez provide easygoing eye pleasing adventures For more adrenaline explore Peneda GerÃªs Portugalâ s only national park where waterfalls canyoning and rafting await Local tip Given Sisteloâ s size book accommodations well in advance or visit on a day trip while exploring the park Winters can be very wet in northern Portugal â spring to early summer is the sweet spot Sete Cidades and its crater lake Brester Irina Shutterstock Sete Cidades The Azores Best village for volcanic crater lake views Scintillating in shades of jade and cobalt Sete Cidades â twin crater lakes are the poster child for SÃ o Miguel the largest of the Azoresâ nine volcanic islands Inside the caldera a dozen streets at the waterâ s edge form the lakeâ s teeny and picturesque community To reach it embark on arguably the Azoresâ most scenic hike the Mata do CanÃ rio with stupendous lake vistas en route and your calves and camera will get a workout Revive with a pot of the island s locally grown tea at O Poejo Left Provesende Kerry Murray for Lonely Planet Right Kerry Murray for Lonely Planet Provesende Douro Valley Best village for wine tasting Plonk yourself anywhere in Portugalâ s dizzying Douro Valley and you wonâ t be disappointed â the worldâ s oldest demarcated wine region is as visually delicious as its vinhos With near vertical terraces dressed in immaculate vines the higher you head the prettier the panoramas become Case in point Provesende one of the Douroâ s most time honored villages sitting slightly off the typical day trip path Itâ s impossible to resist this community s welcome when you sip a glass of port in the knicknack adorned CafÃ o Arado Museu or glimpse inside the small gilded church When itâ s wine time head to Quinta do Cume for a wholesome tour and tasting or stroll through the vines on the SÃ o o do Douro trail Better still stay a few nights at a quinta wine estate or manor house to experience the valley at its hushed best Local tip If youâ re short on time visit the Douro Valley as a day trip from Porto For Provesende take the scenic MiraDouro train to PinhÃ o then a minute taxi buses are infrequent Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Portugal Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers
