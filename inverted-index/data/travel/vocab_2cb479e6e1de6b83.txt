Bloomsbury Wildlife Photograph by Jack Johns TRAVEL Notes from an author Sophie Pavelle on Dartmoor s wild inspiring landscapes Sophie Pavelle journeys around Britain in search of species threatened by climate change and finds magic in Dartmoor s fierceness and fragility By Sophie Pavelle November min read This article was adapted from National Geographic Traveller UK Dartmoor has always been my landscape of firsts Of the UK s national parks it was my debut moorland at four years old freshly landed from the humidity of Augusta Georgia in the US where my brother and I were born Our parents both naval officers at the time were keen for this chapter on British soil to take a more outdoors approach The types of adventures we d assumed were fiction were suddenly possible on our doorstep Living just nine miles from the edge of the national park and even closer to Devon s famous South West Coast Path altered our understanding of what it meant to explore We had footpaths to find hills to climb hidden corners to bookmark We d arrive home breathless and chapped we were invigorated by this blend of habitats and found a new breed of exhaustion Southern Britain s largest area of open upland Dartmoor s square miles are generously peppered with more than granite rocky outcrops known as tors A love of hiking here came as naturally as adolescence We could be on Dartmoor for an entire day without seeing another soul As an introvert with a penchant for adventure this continues to hold great appeal All landscapes answer to time And yet Dartmoor has finessed the shape shift not just over the past million years but in the minutes that come and go as contrasting as fingerprints by Sophie Pavelle Dartmoor was the first place I wild camped it s one of the few places in the UK to allow it under the Countryside Code During the British Army s infamous Ten Tors physical challenge for under my school friends and I discovered for the first time that year olds had tangible limits that could be stretched in new directions rounding corners and finding flow in a river of physical and mental muscle Soon after Dartmoor staged the scene of my first meeting with a boy who loved and hated the same things as me And I like to imagine it as the glue that s held us together for over a decade These moors are the first place I run when life tackles me to the ground I ve yelled answerless questions into howling winds and at vast horizons finding parts of myself that would have remained hidden How different life would be were it not for this mysterious windswept corner of Britain Which conversations unspoken What relationships undiscovered All landscapes answer to time And yet Dartmoor has finessed the shape shift not just over the past million years but in the minutes that come and go as contrasting as fingerprints Like many people I accept change reluctantly and yet I relish Dartmoor s multiplicity of conditions the abruptness of a hailstorm the glare of winter sun fog as thick as night It s the only scenario where I m at peace with the fact that I both can and can t read the next move Dartmoor nourishes more than million other people who visit the national park every year Its rushing waterfalls ancient woodlands wild ponies and peculiar wildlife could quickly be taken for granted were it not for its interwoven tapestry of globally renowned Bronze Age archaeology folklore farming landscape restoration and military activity These vistas are anything but bare There was no question that Dartmoor would conclude my debut book Forget Me Not Finding the Forgotten Species of Climate Change Britain After all it s only right to finish where it all started Nonetheless after years of walking its ways I should have known that Dartmoor continues to gift the unexpected May another first A springtime bike ride to a disused tin mine in North Bovey became the backdrop of my encounter with Britain s endangered bilberry bumblebee Like every one of the species I chose in Forget Me Not I was unaware of what was surviving right under my nose An upland invertebrate whose existence has surrendered to land use changes urbanisation pollution and habitat loss this striking bumblebee has declined dramatically in numbers since the Its life on Dartmoor reveals an ugly truth rising temperatures are making life for pollinators and other key species increasingly turbulent Seeing this bee grip so tightly onto Dartmoor was a reminder that no future is guaranteed in the face of climate change As with people fragility persists no matter how rugged the exterior Still like the bilberry bee we forge on During autumn Dartmoor calls me the loudest with an affirmation of fresher air quieter trails colours I can t paint and rivers urgent with life For those of us lucky enough to spend time on the moors I needn t elaborate This landscape s truth is both known and unknown Dartmoor s magic is its ambiguity Sophie Pavelle is the author of Forget Me Not Finding the
