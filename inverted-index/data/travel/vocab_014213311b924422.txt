Why Tbilisi s One of My Favorite Cities in the World A view of Tbilisi s old town district also known as the Kala Photograph by robertharding Alamy Stock Photo TRAVEL Why Tbilisi s One of My Favorite Cities in the World Georgia s capital is anything but orderly Despite this or because of it it s one of the best most strikingly original cities in the world By Tara Isabella Burton April min read There are cities that make sense The streets glide along straight clean lines their names uniform from start to finish Bridges are crossable Signs point in the proper direction Then there s Tbilisi Riotous and anarchic the capital of Georgia is anything but organized Locals use Soviet era street names Leselidze Davitashvili Perovskaya found only on decades old maps Wine is sold in repurposed Coca Cola bottles for a dollar a liter from boulevard underpasses The electricity still cuts out in the heart of the Kala Tbilisi s historic old town Despite this maybe even because of it this city is one of the best most strikingly original travel destinations in Europe or Asia if not the world Pop into an unmarked courtyard near the Armenian Norashen Church overgrown with ripe pomegranates and find yourself among well fed stray cats in a bohemian artist s studio one of the workers may invite you for home brewed noxiously alcoholic chacha he will not let you refuse nor should you wish to Sneak into the basement of the red brick seminary across from Sioni Cathedral and buy Tbilisi s best bread dough thrown against the scalding sides of a circular tone oven from an elderly kerchief wearing woman for cents a loaf Head up a slanting set of town house stairs in the fin de siècle neighborhood of Sololaki and find yourself in a speakeasy style apartment café called Linville where tables hide behind vines on wrought iron balconies and afternoon tango milongas take place under decorative Victorian parasols Slip across the Dry Bridge past the ruined frescoes of the former Grand Hotel to the flea market and bargain with bearded ex professors for wooden icons Soviet era gas masks and Turkish tea glasses Come more than once and the vendors will remember you I buy my jewelry traditional Georgian enameling from the same seller every year she recalls not just my taste but that of the mother and grandmother I purchased gifts for The cliché of course is that Tbilisi represents the epitome of East meets West a Silk Road crossroads where Arab Ottoman Mongol and Russian imperial forces each left their own distinctive cultural mark And in the heart of the old town where rugs dangle from whitewashed wooden balconies and bearded Georgian Orthodox priests jostle with tourists on narrow cobblestone streets it s a compelling fantasy But the city s reality is far more complicated and intoxicating East and West are all but meaningless terms here where the ancient fortress lording over old town has been used both by and against each set of conquerors where the horizon and the snowcapped Caucasus beyond is punctuated by smoky Soviet tower blocks On Grishashvili Street near the sulfur bathhouses traditionally staffed not by ethnic Georgians the by far majority in this famously tolerant city but by Muslim Azeris a half hidden chaikhana or teahouse serves baklava at carpeted banquettes before an open fire A five minute walk along the Kura River leads to Tartine a French brasserie popular with expats and well heeled locals alike and café au lait delivered in gargantuan bowls And at KGB a restaurant whose tagline is We re still watching you Soviet kitsch takes on a hipster vibe Not all locals are as gleefully tongue in cheek about their city s past however Shopping at the bazroba bazaar or feasting on caraway spiced khinkali meat dumplings in wood paneled working men s taverns you re as likely as not to be dragooned into someone s rhapsodic ode in a mixture of Russian Georgian English and fervently expressive gesturing to the beauty of the mountains the Virgin Mary Mother Georgia the tradition of hospitality or women who happen to be in the vicinity National Geographic Expeditions Travel with National Geographic Search Trips Still if Tbilisi has an aesthetic it s retro collage Hidden bars like O Moda Moda which doubles as a vintage clothing atelier offer mulled wine and cocktails alongside traditional tarragon lemonade and syrupy Lagidze nectars served from massive soda fountains Tbilisi s most iconic eatery Purpur is a collection of mismatched tablecloths century lamp shades and crumbling flea market bric a brac But few places capture Tbilisi s energy like the city s hottest new restaurant Café Littéra brainchild of new celebrity chef Tekuna Gachechiladze located in the palatial mansion that once housed the Soviet Writers Union The food chakapuli stew made with mussels instead of the traditional lamb pomegranate dusted river trout served a la tartare classic badzhe sauce made all but blasphemously with almonds instead of the customary walnuts reflects the best of Tbilisi s breathless fusion culture Sure the electricity might still go out at times But Georgians will light candles shrug and pour you another
