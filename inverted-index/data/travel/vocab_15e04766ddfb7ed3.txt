things to see and do located in the capital of Doha you might be surprised by how many must dos you can squeeze into a short stopover Advertisement Qatar is smaller than the US state of Connecticut so it doesnâ t demand as much time to explore as its larger neighbors Here are things to do in Qatar that are worth shuffling to the top of your itinerary Marvel at Dohaâ s next level museums and galleries Rising up from a purpose built island off Dohaâ s Corniche the postmodern fortress styled Museum of Islamic Art is Qatarâ s showpiece gallery housing the largest collection of Islamic art on the planet In it was joined by another unmissable cultural institution Rebuilt to resemble a desert rose the name for the crystal clusters found in the Qatari desert the National Museum of Qatar charts the nationâ s history with the help of century technology But these arenâ t Qatarâ s only museums and galleries worth seeking out Mathaf the Arab Museum of Modern Art showcases a vast collection of contemporary art with an Arab connection while the Qatar Olympic and Sports Museum which opened in is a sophisticated ode to sports Carpets wraps and rugs are among the traditional textiles on sale in Souq Waqif Â LordRunar Getty Images Get lost in Souq Waqif In the heart of Doha the sprawling Souq Waqif complex is one of the most atmospheric corners of Qatar best visited in the evenings when it brims with locals Built on an ancient market site Souq Waqif was redeveloped in the noughties to look like a century souq market with mud rendered shops and exposed timber beams plus some beautifully restored heritage buildings Despite the rise of Qatarâ s mega malls the Souq Waqif remains at the heart of social and commercial life in Doha one of the few places where people from all rungs of society come together to feast on regional cuisine shop for everything from antique daggers to custom thobes traditional robe commonly worn by men on the Arabian Peninsula or simply sip karak cardamom tea and watch the world go by The Falcon Souq offers a fascinating insight into a favorite Qatari pastime though some visitors may find the leashed falcon displays distressing Nearby stables house Arabian horses and just off the Corniche end of Al Jasra Street a pen is usually filled with camels Go off roading to Qatarâ s iconic â inland seaâ Sign up for a thrilling off roading adventure to Khor Al Adaid Qatarâ s spectacular â inland sea â where enormous shifting sand dunes meet the azure waters of a unique tidal embayment system that creates a natural border between Qatar

displays showcasing the history and pearling heritage of Al Zubarah a once thriving pearling port abandoned in the early century A hour drive from Doha the fort is the only part of the site currently open to the public but if you stand outside and look toward the sea you can just make out the sprawling ruins of the long abandoned town Advertisement Seek out the mysterious Al Jassasiya Rock Carvings This profusion of petroglyphs â nearly rock carvings depicting rosettes fish dhow boats and more â on a rocky outcrop in northeastern Qatar is one of the nationâ s biggest mysteries Up close you may feel underwhelmed by the poorly preserved shapes but imagining communities here hundreds perhaps thousands of years ago is still an evocative experience Some archaeologists have suggested the petroglyphs located miles north of Doha could date back to the century BC while other experts believe they were created between the and centuries AD Signboards offer some background information and maps of the site but thatâ s currently the extent of its tourist facilities Explore the ultra modern Msheireb Downtown district In the heart of Doha the Msheireb Downtown district bills itself as the worldâ s first sustainable Downtown regeneration project While the marketing should perhaps be taken with a grain of salt thereâ s no denying that this compact precinct â blending Islamic and contemporary design elements â is architecturally stunning While most of the buildings are brand new four heritage houses have been beautifully restored and opened to the public as the Msheireb Museums Msheireb is also home to the design and innovation hub which has hosted fashion exhibitions by the likes of Christian Dior and HermÃ s since opening in late A free tram runs through the district which is dotted with restaurants and luxury hotels Eat your way around the world without leaving Doha Qatarâ s melting pot of cultures â less than of the population is ethnic Qatari â has birthed an incredibly diverse food scene that makes dining out in Doha a joy While hotel restaurants tend to focus on European Latin and East Asian cuisines Dohaâ s proliferation of migrant run restaurants serve up a huge range of authentic affordable eats from the Middle East the Subcontinent and beyond with some top wallet friendly eats including Turkey Central for excellent mezze and grilled meats and Bandar Aden for hearty Yemeni dishes You donâ t have to go far in Doha to find a terrific Indian meal Seek out Qatarâ s excellent public art Not all of Qatarâ s art acquisitions are hidden away in museums With a reported arts spending budget of around US billion the nation is constantly adding to its public art collection In Souq Waqif you canâ t miss Pouce a giant golden digit modeled on the late French sculptor CÃ sar Baldacciniâ s own thumb while multiple works can be found in MIA Park and Katara Cultural Village Farther afield in the Education City precinct look out for The Miraculous Journey a series of bronze sculptures by Damien Hirst and US artist Richard Serraâ s huge Eastâ West Westâ East installation rising out of the western desert Even Hamad International Airport has a dozen odd pieces of art including a huge golden falcon by Dutch sculptor Tom Claassen thatâ s perched on a railing outside the departures hall The modern and striking Imam Muhammad Ibn Abd Al Wahhab Mosque is worth a visit Â Walkabout Photo Guides Shutterstock Admire the national mosque Dohaâ s impressive modern Imam Muhammad Ibn Abd Al Wahhab Mosque the largest mosque in the country has a fort like appearance with more than two dozen domes on its roof Itâ s perhaps more striking from the outside particularly at dusk when the mosque s arches and domes are attractively illuminated Taking a peek inside its cavernous largely unadorned prayer hall is allowed outside of prayer times and should be arranged in advance with a local tour agency or through the Sheikh Abdulla Bin Zaid Al Mahmoud Islamic Cultural Center in Souq Waqif Katara Cultural Village is a great spot to learn about Qatar Â Atlantide Phototravel Getty Images Spend a morning wandering Katara This purpose built cultural precinct can feel a bit Disneyland ish but Katara is still worth a visit even just to see its two splendid mosques the glittering gold tiled Golden Mosque and Katara Mosque with its beautifully ornate ceramic tiling Kataraâ s numerous performance and gallery spaces include the classical Greek style Katara Amphitheater while the Al Thuraya Planetarium offers a crash course in Arabic astronomy Katara has a good selection of restaurants and food stalls and itâ s also home to Dohaâ s main public beach Cheer on the camels during the wintertime races Â Cristian Dobre Shutterstock Catch a camel race Camel racing took off in Qatar in the and remains a popular wintertime spectator sport with races held at the Al Shahaniya camel racetrack west of Doha on Fridays from October to February Major events â such as HH the Emirâ s Main Race â are also held in March and April Pioneered in the robot jockeys are now used in Qatari camel races This shift effectively ended a cruel child labor industry once common in the Gulf but visitors with animal welfare concerns should know that the robot jockeys are fitted with remote controlled whips While thereâ s no betting allowed sponsors provide lucrative purses for race winners Wander the â Arabian Rivieraâ at The Pearl Qatarâ s answer to Dubaiâ s The Palm Jumeirah The Pearl is a luxurious artificial island development on Dohaâ s northern fringe that well shows you how oil and gas riches can be spent The Pearlâ s Porto Arabia precinct encircling a yacht studded marina has a pleasant waterfront promenade lined with cafes and restaurants But most visitors get a bigger kick out of visiting the Venetian inspired Qanat Quartier complete with canals brightly colored apartment blocks and even a replica Rialto Bridge Itâ s a far cry from the real deal but youâ ll feel a world away from Qatar Get an unexpected culture hit at a new kind of wellness resort Perched on Qatarâ s northeastern tip Zulal Wellness Resort offers an opportunity to experience Qatari culture in a whole new way The first international outpost from iconic Thai wellness retreat Chiva Som the sprawling complex officially
