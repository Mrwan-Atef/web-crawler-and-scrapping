Cambodia Photograph by Aluxum Getty Images TRAVEL NEWS Travel is said to increase cultural understanding Does it While researchers say travel does affect the brain s neural pathways true empathy remains an elusive destination By Ruth Terry July min read Empathy is commonly defined as putting yourself in another person s shoes or feeling the emotional states of others It s a critical social tool that creates social bridges by promoting shared experiences and producing compassionate behavior But can empathy be learned And can travel help facilitate this learning The answer is complicated Research has shown that empathy is not simply inborn but can actually be taught writes psychotherapist F Diane Barth in Psychology Today While past research has indicated that empathy is an unteachable trait newer research including a Harvard study suggests that the neurobiologically based competency of empathy is mutable and can be taught under the right circumstances Whether seeing the world actually opens travelers minds that it makes travelers more empathetic is up for debate In a Harris Poll of business travelers percent said that business trips helped them to be more empathetic to others reports Quartz And in a study Columbia Business School professor Adam Galinsky found that travel increases awareness of underlying connections and associations with other cultures While self defined empathy and awareness are unreliable measurements it stands to reason that cross cultural exposure through travel would at least create conditions for checking conscious and unconscious biases If we are to move in the direction of a more empathic society and a more compassionate world it is clear that working to enhance our native capacities to empathize is critical to strengthening individual community national and international bonds writes Helen Riess associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and author of the report But the coronavirus pandemic and more recently the global Black Lives Matter protests have forced an uncomfortable reckoning that all the travel in the world might not be enough to engender the deep cross cultural awareness people need now There s this false adage that travel opens minds but that s not a built in fact about what travel does says Travis Levius a Black travel journalist and hospitality consultant based in London and Atlanta Travel does not automatically make you a better person nor does it clue you into what s going on in terms of race relations Black Travel Alliance founder Martina Jones Johnson agrees noting that tourism boards have made it overwhelmingly clear that travel doesn t necessarily build empathy The lack of diversity within the travel industry itself suggests that there s much work to be done to make the industry as inclusive as the world of travel consumers According to a annual report by the U S Commerce Department s Bureau of Labor Statistics workers in the leisure and hospitality industry were overwhelmingly white Consumers meanwhile say they want to spend their money on travel companies whose employees reflect the world they work in according to the World Travel and Tourism Council Additionally companies that embrace inclusivity may have a better chance of avoiding tone deaf messages such as using free at last the line is from Martin Luther King Jr s Dream speech to

Atlantic slave trade in Bordeaux France in June Participating in activities that amplify marginalized voices and experiences can go a long way toward developing empathy say experts Photograph by Andrea Mantovani The New York Times Redux A road paved with good intentions Interestingly modern tourism has fairly empathic origins In the Thomas Cook used new railway systems to develop short haul leisure travel as respites for hard working British laborers according to Freya Higgins Desbiolles a senior lecturer on tourism management at the University of South Australia A hundred years later the United Nations declared reasonable working hours paid holidays and rest and leisure as human rights By the spurred by related movements to increase holiday time the leisure sector had coalesced into a full fledged professional industry Since then the World Tourism Organization and international aid groups have championed tourism as both a vital force for world peace that can provide the moral and intellectual basis for international understanding and interdependence as well as an economic development strategy for poorer nations But not everyone agrees that the travel industry has lived up to these lofty goals In recent decades it has been accused of doing just the opposite As Stephen Wearing wrote nearly years ago tourism perpetuates inequality because multinational corporations from capitalist countries hold all the economic and resource power over developing nations Related This is how national parks are fighting racism These days inequality is baked into the very process of traveling says veteran Time magazine foreign correspondent and Roads Kingdoms co founder Nathan Thornburgh Your frequent flier status the stupid little cordon separating the boarding lines the way you take an Uber or cab from the airport after you land not a bus or colectivo or matatu those all reinforce divisions not empathy he writes in an email And that s just getting to a place Empathy s downsides Experts say developing empathy isn t easy and comes with a host of problems Joseph M Cheer a professor at Wakayama University s Center for Tourism Research in Japan notes that empathy inherently others another person In his study of westerners on a bike tour in Cambodia Cheer found that despite the prosocial aspects of the experience visiting local non governmental organizations interacting with local Cambodians post tour interviews revealed that the tourists didn t understand the cultural context of the outing The visitors leaned into problematic tropes like happy lovely and generous when describing locals or simply saw Cambodians as service providers This othering bias Cheer says becomes more noticeable the greater the distance between tourists and locals and especially so in strictly transactional encounters such as in hotels A worker at a resort in Bali Researchers say visitors should make a commitment to understand local cultures by moving past transactional interactions Photograph by Philippe Charlot Redux Our individual travel experiences oppose our best intentions says travel writer Bani Amor who has written extensively on race place and power The stated positive intentions are completely contradictive to what happens in the tourism industry and how oppressive it is to BIPOC Black indigenous and people of color around the world how tourism laborers are being treated and how they re being dispossessed not having a right to their own land and to enjoy our own places says Amor who has worked in the tourism industry in their ancestral home of Ecuador You can only really know your own experience adds Anu Taranath a racial equity professor at the University of Washington Seattle and a second generation immigrant I think we can develop empathetic feelings and sort of crack open our sense of self to include other people s experiences in it We can only deepen our own understanding of who we are in an unequal world and how that makes us feel and how that motivates us to shift our life in some way or another I think in its purest form empathy is basically impossible I can weep for you but I can t weep as you Nathan Thornburgh founder Roads Kingdoms Or as Thornburgh puts it I think in its purest form empathy is basically impossible I can weep for you but I can t weep as you Traveling deeper While experts conclude that travel may not inspire enough empathy to turn tourists into social justice activists the alternative not traveling at all may actually be worse B ecause travel produces encounters between strangers it is likely to prompt empathetic type imaginings which simply wouldn t be there without the proximity created by travel says Hazel Tucker in a study published in the Annals of Tourism It s also one reason why it s important to expose children to travel at an early age Yet truly transformational experiences require more than just showing up with a suitcase It requires energy effort and commitment on the part of tourists as well as specific conditions says Higgins Desbiolles Visitors need to be prepped for the interaction so that they are ready to engage with the people on an equal level she notes Taranath s book Beyond Guilt Trips Mindful Travel in an Unequal World may provide some starting points It s an invitation to think more carefully about our good intentions and where they really need to be challenged Taranath explains How do you think about identity and difference in an unequal world What does it actually look like Additionally Tucker suggests embracing what she calls unsettled empathy learning about the cultures you re planning to visit and sitting with uncomfortable legacies of colonialism slavery genocide and displacement from which no destinations are exempt Barbara Manigault a Gullah sweet grass basket weaver practices her craft in Mount Pleasant South Carolina American tourists with limited travel opportunities can find many places in the U S to learn more about other cultures Photograph by Richard Ellis Alamy Stock Photo That background can be the basis for meaningful conversations which Cheer found are the key element that prompted empathy Thornburgh adds that travelers should seek out places where there is an equal and humanistic exchange or something approaching it between the visitors and the visited Related The E U has banned American travelers So where can they go Toward that end experts generally ruled out cruises Instead immersive experiences like Black Heritage Tours that amplify historically marginalized voices provide better opportunities for meaningful connections Fortunately for would be travelers those opportunities can be found even in these pandemic times when many countries are restricting international travel especially for Americans We are so lucky in this country that the whole world has come here to build their lives in big cities and small and that we have Black and Native American
