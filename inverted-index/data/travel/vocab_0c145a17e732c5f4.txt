Yoon Mar min read Share Bukaksan and the leafy Seongbuk dong neighborhood Stock for you Shutterstock Away from the bustle of business and tourists neighborhoods in Seoul brim with inviting cafes intriguing galleries and historic sites In these smaller slices of a huge city you can make a deeper connection with both the area and its residents and get to know the city and its rhythms of daily life throughout the year So after youâ ve taken in the landmarks of the ultramodern central district make like a local and head to one of the South Korean capital s vibrant boroughs to unwind Whether exploring temples in Seongbuk dong or alleyways in Bukchon Hanok Village dog spotting in Yeonnam dong barhopping in Euljiro or gallery hopping in Seongsu dong youâ re certain to love these five of the best neighborhoods in Seoul Advertisement The rooflines of traditional style buildings in Bukchon Hanok Village Vincent St Thomas Shutterstock Bukchon Hanok Village Best for soaking up historic atmosphere Nestled between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung palaces Bukchon Hanok Village is a popular destination thatâ s worth the hype When youâ re strolling along the streets lined with hanok traditional Korean houses â a budget friendly activity in a pricey city â it doesnâ t take long to realize why Seoulites recommend this place so ardently and why it continues to charm all who visit The authorities say that the more than hanok here offer the best representation of Seoulâ s year old urban history While the buildings are almost entirely reconstructed or full on replicas you will feel like youâ re in another time when you wander this area In recent years that atmosphere has been accentuated by the popularity of borrowing hanbok traditional Korean gowns for photo walks Visit during the week to avoid the crowds Start by grabbing a map of the neighborhood from Bukchon Traditional Culture Center which pinpoints great photo spots Then sneak down quiet alleyways filled with small cafes and tea shops venturing away from large groups and into Koreaâ s past Yeonnam dong Best for dog lovers An estimated six million households in South Korea have dogs and one of the top places to see them living their best lives is in Yeonnam dong a neighborhood northwest of Hongdae thatâ s full of dog friendly spaces Advertisement Start your dog spotting journey at Gyeongui Line Forest Park This green space built on top of railroad tracks that once extended to North Korea is popular with both the two and four legged residents of the neighborhood In the grassy area outside Hongik University Station Exit youâ ll see humans enjoying a bit of day drinking and dogs of all sizes shapes and fashion styles itâ s common for dogs to wear clothes in South Korea Brunch eatery Grain and a branch of the vegan restaurant Plant are just two of the many places that welcome dogs in Yeonnam dong Some like Gelateria Eta and Thanks Oat even have canine specific items on the menu A few dog friendly cafes like Oui Oui Club and Bite Me have clothes and accessories you can pick up as souvenirs for your puppy pal at home Nogari Alley aaron choi Shutterstock Euljiro Best for cool bars and traditional dried fish From bars lit with a neon glow to hidden places tucked behind unassuming doors Euljiro has so many cool spaces that locals call it â Hip jiro â The evolution or gentrification of this neighborhood started around when younger people began moving to the district then known for warehouses electronics shops and printing presses One of first newcomers was Seendosi which means â new cityâ a laid back independent bar that extends from the floor to a floor rooftop Since few businesses like this existed in this part of Seoul when it opened visiting used to mean walking into a dark neighborhood and climbing up four flights of stairs in an empty warehouse before reaching Seendosiâ s dim pink ambiance and alternative music Seendosi has added more lights since then and the area is now teeming with bars following a similar formula of industrial chic Owned by a group of friends is a wine bar marked only by simple sign with â wineâ written out in red tape Eulji Maekok Euljiro Brewing is a two story craft beer pub with fun illustrations of partying cats and excellent drinks For those who prefer a more down to earth vibe Nogari Alley brims with old school pubs that sell local beer and nogari dried pollock fish with seats often spilling out on the streets Seongsu dong Best for creative types Many call Seongsu dong the Brooklyn of Seoul Yet before younger generations moved in the neighborhood was the go to place for shoes home to of the nationâ s handmade shoe manufacturers While this part of town still has a few dozen shops dedicated to custom footwear art galleries cafes and vintage clothing boutiques occupy many of the converted warehouses One of the first businesses to attract attention to the area was Daelim Changgo a cafe and art gallery outfitted in a former factory warehouse Cafes like Onion Grandpa Factory and Dorrell later replicated the warehouse conversion formula and the uptick in artsy types gave birth to a vibrant street art and gallery scene Have a cup of coffee and check out Collast Art Project CO and Kabinett three talked about galleries where contemporary Korean art is front and center The Seongsu dong art scene is focused on up and coming experimental artists and the vibe is more chill than in better known neighborhoods of Seoul such as Gangnam Bring your camera for fun shots of street art get caffeinated at one of the many cafes and gallery hop to your heartâ s content Buying new shoes is optional Gilsang sa aaron choi Shutterstock Seongbuk dong Best for slowing down A short bus ride from Hansung University Station Seongbuk dong is a relatively quiet hillside district lesser known to visitors The neighborhood once housed refugees and lower income families after the Korean War today itâ s better known for its wealth of diplomatic residences and upscale homes Itâ s implied that the fancy house from the film Parasite is located here Seongbuk dong feels distinctly different from other parts of the city since itâ s not as dense and the greenery of the Bugaksan and Bukhansan slopes is visible from most corners of the neighborhood The area has several often overlooked attractions many of which allow you to take a breather from the bustle of typical Seoul life At Gilsang sa consider a Templestay program a cultural experience that immerses you in traditional Korean Buddhism Activities include conversations with Buddhists tea time and sometimes overnight stays Nearby you can drink Korean tea at Suyeon Sabang which was once a poetâ s house Uphill Manhae Han Yong un Simujang used to be the home of Buddhist reformist and poet Han Yong un Now owned by the government the house is open to the public but because itâ s not an official museum it doesnâ t have guards and thereâ s little foot traffic Visitors can simply enter take off their shoes and relax in the same room where the poet took naps â a perfect place to enjoy the quiet of the hillside Advertisement
