Planet Editors Jul min read Share Vegas offers more places to stay and explore than just the Strip Â Mark Read Lonely Planet The perennial adult playground of the USA Las Vegas is famous for its bright lights dice and indulgences But there is more to this jewel in the Nevada desert than bling and slot machines Locals have created individual neighborhoods with cultural offerings beyond the usual Vegas tropes Take your time to explore each one rather than rush through at a hectic pace â Las Vegas s neighborhoods have a lot to offer and are worth your time Advertisement Atomic Liquors on Fremont Street is the oldest freestanding bar in Las Vegas Â Greg Thillmont Lonely Planet Downtown Best neighborhood for vintage Vegas With its retro casinos the vibrant Arts and Fremont East Entertainment districts cool museums and free entertainment galore a visit or stay Downtown is the antidote for all Strip related maladies It s is a great place to base yourself if the Strip doesn t appeal The area s clutch of old school casinos usually have good quality rooms at ridiculously good rates that will make you never want to stay in a hostel again Walking west on Fremont takes you along the Fremont Street Experience you can t miss Slotzilla greeting you upon arrival South of here is the loosely organized Arts District Walking east you ll immediately be in the Fremont Street East Entertainment Precinct chock full of interesting bars restaurants and community galleries If you re a fan of vintage shopping racks of bowling shirts gold rimmed martini glasses and neon signs on the myriad shops on Main St await you Another retro must see is the Mob Museum â Las Vegas old federal courthouse that has been repurposed to house a cutting edge collection of mob memorabilia and the history of organised crime in early America Steer clear of the area east of the Container Park and north of the Interstate you have to walk underneath it so you ll know at night instances of street crime are not uncommon Stick to the well lit tourist areas and you should be just fine Rocky desert landscape at sunset Red Rock Canyon National Recreation Area Â Dean Pennalad Summerlin Best neighborhood for outdoor adventures If you re excited by Las Vegas but everything about the Strip makes you a little anxious Summerlin is for you Consider making Red Rock Casino or the area around Downtown Summerlin your base less than minutes drive from spectacular Red Rock Canyon the star of the Las Vegas Valley This part of town has a selection of comfortable and stylish accommodations and a wealth of great restaurants spanning a range of genres and tastes in settings from smart casual alfresco to high end country club Advertisement Summerlin might not be your bag for your entire stay in Vegas but it s worth considering spending a night here especially when the rowdiness of the Strip starts to wear you down and you need a fix of nature or a meal you can actually savor without dreading the bill or the song and dance of choosing which celebrity chef If it s comfort you seek without the hype Summerlin will deliver â it doesn t skimp on fine dining high end shopping quality accommodations or natural beauty The Las Vegas strip photographed at night with streaks of white and the Caesar s Palace Sign lit up Â Dennis Hohl Getty Images EyeEm The Strip The best neighborhood for sensory overload It s Vegas entertainment central the epicenter in a vortex of limitless potential where almost anything goes and time becomes elastic Heads spin at the endless sales pitches some get lucky many have such an unspeakably good time they don t seem to mind incinerating their hard earned cash Magic dwells in this mile garden of earthly delights but finding yours can be tricky the Strip excels at distraction Vegas is famous for its shameless re creations of famous sights Egyptian pyramids the Eiffel Tower Venetian canals Jet from Europe to Polynesia and back without changing time zones â or even leaving the Strip Start at the Big Daddy Caesars Palace on the center Strip and you ll know straight away that you re in Vegas baby Linger a little in Ancient Rome then cross over to the slightly more chilled LINQ Promenade where you can take a breather down a beer a cupcake fish and chips or a sushirrito sushi burrito then decide north via Venice to the Stratosphere Nevada s tallest building for more views thrills and spills or south to Mandalay Bay the something for everyone tropical oasis in the desert via Paris a pyramid and New York If you throw a lucky dice or two on your world tour of the Strip move on to retail therapy Shopping here ranges from the sublime to the ridiculous with almost any human luxury you can imagine available somewhere That said luxury comes with a price tag If you didn t win big on the floor check out the excellent selection of discount merch at the not on the Strip but not far from it Las Vegas Premium Outlets North and South Two guys play pinball at the Pinball Hall of Fame in Las Vegas Â Brian van der Brug Los Angeles Times via Getty Images East of the Strip The best neighborhood for a local experience Visits east reward explorers with a deeper understanding of what makes Vegas tick You won t find many typical Vegas style sights here but instead there are collections of vintage pinball machines rock and roll memorabilia and a glimpse into the city s dark atomic past You ll also find cheap eats bars where bartenders drink and a vibrant LGBTIQ scene This is locals Vegas home for many of the folks whose hard work makes the Strip tick the anything goes mentality that passes on the Strip isn t kosher here Aside from the Pinball Hall of Fame and the National Atomic Testing Museum sights east of the Strip are few This is where you come to get a sense of real life Las Vegas â how things are for the majority of Las Vegans You ll likely find the working class neighborhoods of this big desert city have a very different feel to other parts of the US or where you call home Keep an open mind and have a friendly demeanour â there s much to discover Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas Â Ray Laskowitz Lonely Planet West of the Strip The best neighborhood for oases in the desert It s really hard to define the area west of the Strip but the easiest way to get a handle on it is to head to Rio in the daytime and ride the elevators up to the patio of the VooDoo Rooftop Nightclub It probably won t be open for food and beverage service but you can still enjoy the incredible views of the Strip and the Las Vegas Valley and make a plan A good place to start is the legendary Palms Casino which has undergone a serious makeover featuring revamped rooms the scalding hot new Kaos nightclub and pool and some excellent celebrity chef helmed restaurants Throw in a sky high zipline Vegas newest casino an eco minded desert oasis and the diverse flavors of Chinatown Plaza and suddenly you ve got a neighborhood or at least an evening to rival the Strip Don t try and walk between sights â nothing is really near anything else and you re in the Mojave Desert if you d forgotten When the buzz of the casino gets a little too much wander through the gorgeous desert gardens at the Springs Preserve for a soothing respite from all that neon Enjoying these educational meticulously maintained botanical gardens which are literally oases in the desert You might also like The best parks in Las Vegas The best day trips from Las Vegas The best things you can do for free in Las Vegas Advertisement Advertisement
