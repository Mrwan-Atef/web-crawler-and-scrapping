Find the best time to relax on one of Fijiâ s dazzling islands Getty Images White sand beaches swaying palm fronds colorful coral reefs for many the allure of Fiji is in its landscapes Yet this South Pacific archipelago offers just as many incredible local experiences that complement its natural assets The best weather in Fiji coincides with higher prices and bigger crowds but thereâ s never a bad time to visit â not even during cyclone season I ll explain why Advertisement Whether you want to lounge on a beach sail between islands or snorkel with manta rays hereâ s the best time to head to Fiji June to September is a great time to play in the surf scuba dive or laze at a resort Justin Lewis Getty Images June to September is the high season in Fiji â with idyllic weather Fiji has two seasons summer the wet season and winter the dry season The latter generally June to September is the peak tourist season in Fiji with temperatures hovering between Expect an uptick in accommodation prices The large resorts on Denarau Island are usually filled with families from Australia and New Zealand who come during their winter school holidays The words â high seasonâ might conjure images of crowds jostling for a spot in the sand but outside of Denarau resorts are spread out amongst the islands making it possible to find a slice of serenity even at this busy time of year This is also the best time to enjoy Fijiâ s ocean adventures Surfers saddled with board bags and spare leashes come to catch waves at iconic surf spots like Cloudbreak at Tavarua Island home to the World Surf League Championships Even if youâ re not a surfer itâ s worth catching the minute boat ride out to watch the pros try to make it through near perfect barrels Advertisement Peer out on the horizon during these months and youâ ll likely notice the silhouettes of sails out over the water Sailors from throughout the South Pacific blow into Fiji to explore the islands by boat and participate in Fiji Regatta Week during September Itâ s a great time to sign up for a dayâ s sailing or try your hand on your resortâ s Hobie catamaran For a glimpse at Fijiâ s long seafaring history pay a visit to the Fiji Museum and admire a replica drua a traditional sailing canoe A working traditional vessel the Uto Ni Yalo often sails around the islands during this time as well Under the seaâ s surface thereâ s plenty going on during this time too The best time to scuba dive and snorkel with manta rays is from May to October as they hang around Fijiâ s Yasawa Islands and the Great Astrolabe Reef off Kadavu A lack of rainfall around the islands of Vanua Levu and Taveuni creates great visibility during this time for scuba divers keen to explore thriving reefs of soft and hard corals Most of the tourists have gone but the weather is still amazing in the shoulder season RuslanDashinsky Getty Images Visit Fiji in May or October for fewer crowds but plenty of sun May and October are considered Fijiâ s shoulder months offering that sweet spot of fewer fellow tourists and pleasant weather In May the start of the dry season temperatures climb towards the high Cs high By the end of October Fijiâ s temperatures consistently warm up to the low Cs low with relatively low humidity October is also one of Fijiâ s most festive months At the start of the month Fijians celebrate Fiji Day commemorating their independence from British rule Many Fijians will use this long weekend to head to the beaches enjoy a hearty feast called a lovo and put on music and dance performances In October or early November Uprising Beach Resort hosts the largest music festival in Fiji Itâ s a chance to kick your shoes off and dance as local musicians play from midday until late into the night on the beach At the end of October or November depending on the year Fiji also celebrates the Hindu holiday Diwali Diwali is a festival of lights where Fijiâ s skies are alight with fireworks Itâ s customary to hop from home to home enjoying incredible Indian curries and sweets lighting candles and exchanging gifts Nearly half of Fijiâ s citizens â predominantly the Indo Fijian population â are Hindu though Diwali celebrations extend to everyone Even in the wet season you ll catch plenty of sunshine on the islands like Vanua Levu Chris Chen for Lonely Planet Take advantage of low season rates during Fijiâ s cyclone season November to April The climate in Fiji is warm all year round especially during tropical cyclone season This falls during the wet season which begins in November and runs until April According to the Fiji Meteorological Service the peak tends to be between January and February the hottest months in Fiji While planning a holiday to Fiji during this time can feel a bit risky if you seek sunshine and calm seas there is still a high chance of having pleasant weather Temperatures can climb during the day though most days theyâ ll linger around the high high On the smaller islands heavy rainstorms come and go quickly often leaving blue skies in their wake Outside of the Christmas and New Yearâ s school holidays youâ ll find that accommodation prices tend to be cheaper than most other months of the year Youâ re also likely to have your pick of room choices Christmas is one of Fijiâ s largest religious holidays as over half of the population is Christian Special markets music performances and events take place on the main islands and a floral shirt or dress paired with sandals makes for the perfect party attire Fijiâ s major cities throw parties for New Yearâ s Eve and celebrations continue late into the next day as Fiji is one of the first countries to ring in the New Year The International Date Line once ran through the island of Taveuni and straddling the former date line on New Yearâ s Day is a novel thing to tick off your bucket list March is usually the wettest month on Viti Levu â s western end with an average rainfall of in in Nadi In the cities Hindu Indo Fijians bump up the saturation by throwing colorful powders at one another in celebration of Holi a festival of new beginnings At the end of March and early April join a church service for Easter and prepare to be enchanted by Fijian hymns April salutes the end of cyclone season with rainstorms dwindling by the end of the month Temperatures however linger into the high high
