Collection TRAVEL The rise of vegan safaris A plant based lifestyle is about more than just diet Can African safaris meet the challenge By Jennifer Billock January min read There are some experiences vegan travelers know they might feel uncomfortable with such as an African safari A typical safari serves meat heavy cuisine has guests lounging on leather couches and takes diesel fueled safari drives to observe game animals For the growing number of Americans who follow a lifestyle that not only eschews eating meat but also focuses on sustainability and conservation of the Earth s resources that means safaris can be a big turnoff Now though some outfitters are offering safaris that are more accessible to vegans These trips do more than just serve plant based meals they also focus on limiting exposure to animal products minimizing impacts to the environment and offsetting carbon emissions from the journey itself But how vegan friendly can safaris really be What s a vegan friendly safari The first vegan safaris launched around with Vegan Safari Africa and World Vegan Travel offering experiences in Botswana South Africa and Rwanda Now with more travelers identifying as vegan or vegetarian according to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA these safaris are not only more accessible and sustainable but also a new income stream for outfitters These trends are transforming traditional safaris for the better Vegan Safari Africa based in Botswana and run by married couple Helene Sandenbergh and David Forward has offered vegan safaris through partner lodges for about six years It s a departure from David s history there His father arrived in Botswana in with a group of big game hunters and when David was a child he had wanted to follow in his father s footsteps Giraffes are one of the animals that can be seen during walking safari tours at Shamwari Private Game Reserve in South Africa Photograph courtesy of Shamwari Private Game Preserve Guided boat tours with Vegan Safari are a less obtrusive way to view wildlife in the Okavango Delta in Botswana Photograph courtesy of Vegan Safari Africa Now the Forwards take about six people at a time out on vegan safaris in Botswana and Zambia They use a four wheel drive vehicle with a professional local guide and spend up to nights camping in the bush They don t have a permanent lodge instead partnering with existing vegan friendly lodges when needed to lessen their environmental impact Campsites operate with a leave no trace policy Guests have reusable water bottles soaps are handmade by locals biodegradable and not tested on animals and all the food served is vegan Wildlife drives go out every morning and guests relax at camp the rest of the day The guides are very sensitive in the way they go around looking for animals says Helene If guides need to shine a spotlight to see animals on a drive for example they use a red tinted light to minimize disruption Another company Vegans Baby in collaboration with Alluring Africa offers safaris in South Africa and new for Botswana The company uses cruelty free toiletries meaning they weren t tested on animals and contain no animal products and wool and silk free linens and they avoid spaces displaying animal skins such as leather chairs or hunting trophies such as horns hung on a wall Camp accommodations with Vegan Safari typically feature animal friendly decor and materials Photograph courtesy of Vegan Safari Africa The South African itinerary is hosted at Shamwari Private Game Reserve where meals might incorporate vegetables from the lodge garden roasted on a bonfire Activities include drives to spot big cats elephants and giraffes in reserves that limit off roading walks to learn about the bush ecosystem planting trees to offset carbon emissions and helping at sanctuaries and rehabilitation centers for orphaned wildlife Will plant based meat ever satisfy America s hunger for the real thing Other options include Kings Camp in South Africa which provides vegan food and a safari guide who is vegan and Emboo Camp in Kenya Emboo is the first company in east Africa to have a full fleet of electric safari vehicles that are charged with solar power At the lodge which also runs on solar power water and trash are recycled and a garden provides ingredients for meals Visitors to Emboo Camp in the

awards for animal friendly African safaris this January It was the first time PETA has given this award Nevertheless the number of vegan safari outfitters is still quite low says Wolfgang Strasdas a professor of sustainable tourism management at Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development in Germany The market for this type of safari remains small he says but there could also be a cultural difference The countries where safaris take place have a meat eating culture partially due to the natural semi arid conditions where growing crops may be difficult Strasdas says Opportunity or opportunistic Going meatless is just one aspect of vegan travel however All safaris impact the local ecosystem and environment especially in the popular parks where animal harassment habitat destruction pollution and off road driving can occur We have seen reduction in grazing land as well as soil erosion in certain areas of the Maasai Mara due to the intensity of off road trucking says Shem Wambugu Maingi a safari ecotourism expert and lecturer at Kenyatta University in Kenya Considerations of overall sustainability would also address the airline and car transportation that travelers took to arrive at their destination as well as how far food was shipped if not grown onsite I don t want to be too pessimistic about that because it s a contradiction that we have to live with Strasdas says Safari tourism if it s well managed has a lot of benefits to the destinations Here s how to do wildlife tourism the right way Ultimately Strasdas and Maingi agree that vegan safaris even though they might not be completely vegan are fairly sustainable especially if the companies are hiring locally the lodges are growing their own food and the safari groups focus on habitat preservation and restoration As long as travelers keep the environment and community top of mind vegan safaris can be beneficial to both people and the planet Connect with people from around the world find out about their lives explore the wilderness and deeply appreciate what we have to lose recommends Helene Sandenbergh Get inspired by it and then work towards solutions Jennifer Billock is an
