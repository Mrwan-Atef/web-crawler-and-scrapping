You ll need to hire a car or organise a taxi for the day to watch the sunset over Sete Cidades on SÃ o Miguel Island Â Maya Karkalicheva Getty Images The Azoreans travel frequently between islands all year so the archipelago has a reasonable network of inter island flights and ferry routes making it easy to navigate all nine islands Weather is the only thing that might cause a sudden change of plans but as locals put it that s just a part of the Azorean experience On the islands of the Azores buses are not the most reliable option so renting a car or hiring a taxi is often the better alternative â except in Corvo where the island is so small you can walk everywhere Advertisement Explore SÃ o Miguel Island on your own time with your own wheels Â Vitor Miranda Shutterstock Explore the Azores on your own time by driving Renting a car is the most practical way to travel around the Azores at your own pace â signs for major sights are clear the traffic is often low and most of the main roads are well maintained However during peak season especially in smaller islands with fewer resources a scarcity of cars sees an increase in prices and parking spaces can be hard to find near restaurants top attractions and beaches Some rural roads are so narrow they appear to be one lane when in fact they re two way streets â unless a traffic sign states otherwise always expect cars coming in the opposite direction And itâ s not a myth that most of the countryside traffic jams are caused by farmers leading herds of cows between grasslands Get as close to the side of the road as possible turn off your engine and wait it out Want to explore the Azores without hiring a car Find out how to do it Non drivers can hire a taxi to visit must see attractions For non drivers or if you couldnâ t rent a car due to peak season scarcity hiring a taxi to cover the highlights is a practical way of getting around in the Azores Taxis arenâ t metered so theyâ ll either charge a fixed fee based on the area or destinations you want to cover or charge you by the hour plan for around â per hour Taxi drivers often speak English although sometimes only well enough for basic communication Those who are a little more fluent will be happy to answer your questions about the island and the sights to the best of their knowledge Also expect no strings attached local tips on where to eat and must sees especially on the smaller islands Advertisement Finding a cab that offers round the island tours or sightseeing trips is as easy as asking the person driving the taxi from the airport to the hotel â it s typically a service they offer and if they don t they ll know someone who does Negotiation is usually between you and the driver but prices generally donâ t vary much between taxi companies Prices are usually quoted as a fixed fees per trip rather than per passenger but always check before agreeing to a rate From above the volcanic origins of the Azores becomes apparent Â Enrico Pescantini iStockphoto Getty Images Island hop comfortably by flying Government owned SATA Air AÃ ores is the only airline operating all inter island flights and locals use it pretty much like a bus system travelling between islands for shopping doctor s appointments and business trips That said not all routes are convenient and for neighbouring islands it s usually easier to take the ferry Keep in mind especially when travelling with small children that flying between islands is sometimes an exercise in patience Some flights will make one or two stops before you reach your final destination which means disembarking for every layover even if itâ s no longer than or minutes â this is very common when flying from SÃ o Miguel to smaller islands in the Central and West groups Some planes are small with limited space in the overhead compartment and under the front seat Most passengers only discover which plane they re boarding at the gate or on the tarmac If the flight is full you can ask the crew if they can accommodate your luggage in the cargo hold Keep an eye out for whales and dolphins between May and July on the way to Pico Â Tane Mahuta Getty Images See more islands for the price of one by taking the ferry One ferry ride between close islands can take up to minutes â making it faster cheaper and more convenient than a flight Islanders use it frequently especially between Faial and Pico to commute to work Purchase tickets online at the AtlÃ ntico Line website or before your trip at the boat station The routes with the most frequent trips are the Blue Line which connects Pico and Faial a minute ride and the Green Line which goes all the way to SÃ o Jorge close to a one hour ride The Pink Line connects Flores and Corvo twice a day minute trip from two times a week in the winter to six days a week in the peak season From June to September the ferry company increases the trips frequency with three seasonal routes operating two to three days a week The Orange Line connects Pico and SÃ o Jorge at least twice a day travellers on the White Line can visit all five islands in the Central Group twice a week and the Purple Line connects Terceira to SÃ o Jorge Pico and Faial two times a week A localâ s tip for riding the ferry Take it from a local with motion sickness ferry trips between the â triangle islandsâ Faial Pico and SÃ o Jorge are a breeze in the summer and a little rougher in the winter but not impossible to make it with the help of preventive motion sickness medication Ferries are big and stable and the weather is usually good enough for passengers to sit outside on the top tier Between Flores and Corvo though frequent choppy waters and a small boat can make trips a bit more uncomfortable The Azores transportation FAQs and things to consider Is Uber in the Azores A few years ago there was a short lived attempt at implementing ride share services on the larger island of SÃ o Miguel but it never truly took off For the time being Uber is not available in the Azores Is the public transport in the Azores reliable Each island except Corvo has its own public bus system but schedules and frequency are not the most reliable for travellers Typically there s one bus in the morning and another at the end of the day mainly serving schools and workplaces SÃ o Miguel is the island with the best options to travel by bus to top sites but it takes some planning and flexibility Accessible travel in the Azores Unfortunately regarding accessibility the Azores have not quite hit the mark yet For now only Azores For All a SÃ o Miguel based private tour operator has transportation options for travellers living with a disability Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Portugal Let a
