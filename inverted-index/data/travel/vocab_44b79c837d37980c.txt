Plitvice Lakes National Park Plitvice Lakes National Park Croatia Attractions Lonely Planet Lonely Planet Destinations Planning Inspiration Shop Search Saves Open main menu Getty Images Flickr RF Plitvice Lakes National Park Croatia Europe Top choice in Plitvice Lakes National Park Login Save By far Croatia s top natural attraction and the absolute highlight of Croatia s Adriatic hinterland the Plitvice Lakes National Park is a glorious expanse of forested hills and turquoise lakes Within the boundaries of this heavily forested national park crystalline lakes tumble into each other via a series of waterfalls and cascades The mineral rich waters carve through the rock depositing tufa in continually changing formations Clouds of butterflies drift above the miles of wooden footbridges and pathways that snake around the edges and across the rumbling water It s exquisitely scenic so much so that in Unesco proclaimed it a World Heritage Site The name is slightly misleading though as it s not so much the lakes that are the attraction here but the hundreds of waterfalls that link them Exploring the park From Entrance the southernmost of the two entrances it s an easy amble down to the shore of mile long Kozjak Lake and a hut and boat stop Surrounded by steep forested slopes Kozjak is the park s largest lake and forms a boundary between the upper and lower valleys It contains a small oval island composed of travertine A good path runs along the lake s eastern shore follow it to reach the spectacular lower lakes with forests grottoes steep cliffs and waterfalls or take one of the regular free boats Next is emerald Milanovac Lake then the path runs below cliffs beside Gavanovac Lake Above is the open topped cavern of Šupljara where there s a lovely viewpoint over Plitvice s lower reaches A wooden walkway cuts across to the north bank around reed fringed Kaluđerovac Lake and past two towering sets of waterfalls The second the aptly named Veliki Slap is the tallest in Croatia with a drop Follow the trails to see the cascades of Plitvice Mark Read Lonely Planet To explore the upper section of the lakes return to and follow the trails to Gradinsko Lake bordered by reeds that often harbor nesting wild ducks A series of cascades links Gradinsko to beautiful Galovac Lake where an abundance of water has formed a series of ponds and falls A set of concrete stairs over the falls constructed long ago has been covered by travertine forming even more falls in a spectacular panorama Several smaller lakes are topped by the larger Okrugljak Lake supplied by two powerful waterfalls Continuing upwards you ll come to Ciginovac Lake and finally Prošćansko Lake surrounded by thick forests Various combinations of boat road train a tourist bus with carriages and hiking are available depending on your level of fitness and the amount of time you have A useful map is printed on the tickets and the information booths are extremely helpful Spring and fall are the best times to visit Mark Read Lonely Planet When to visit While the park is beautiful year round spring and fall are the best times to visit In spring and early summer the falls are flush with water while in autumn the changing leaves put on a colorful display Winter is also spectacular although snow can limit access and the free park transport doesn t operate Unquestionably the worst time to visit is in the peak months of July and August when the falls reduce to a trickle parking is problematic and the sheer volume of visitors can turn the walking tracks into a conga line and cause lengthy waits for the buses and boats that ferry people around the park If you have limited time focus on one section of the park SJ Travel Photo and Video Shutterstock Tickets and other practicalities Tickets must be purchased online at least one day in advance of your visit The extraordinary natural beauty of the park merits a full day s exploration but you can still experience a lot on a half day trip from Zadar or Zagreb You must be able to walk a fair distance to get the most out of the place If you ve got limited time the upper lake section can be completed in two hours The lower section takes about three although it s best to start with the bus ride and end with the boat to save yourself a climb Swimming is not permitted in any of the lakes Hotels and campsites near Plitvice National Park The four hotels operated by the national park are relatively charmless institutions but they re conveniently positioned right on the park s borders There are also two campsites Otherwise there are excellent guesthouses within walking distance in surrounding villages For a particularly atmospheric alternative hunt for private rooms in tiny Korana an idyllic village set by a gurgling stream and reached by a narrow road north of the Korana bridge Read more Exploring Croatia s national parks Read more Contact Get In Touch https www np plitvicka jezera hr Suggest an edit to
