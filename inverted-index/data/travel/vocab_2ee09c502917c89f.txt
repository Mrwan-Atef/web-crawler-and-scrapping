Wellness in the wilderness Scotland s nature retreat for the modern age Taking in the view across Glen Dye private estate in the Highlands TRAVEL Wellness in the wilderness Scotland s nature retreat for the modern age The Highlands of Scotland offer a unique sense of remote serenity making it the perfect location for Glen Dye s School of Wild Wellness and Bushcraft By Lucy Gillmore Photographs by Flore Diamant April min read This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK If I could pass on anything to the world it would be how to use a dock leaf properly As gifts to humanity go it s a little left field but I m not going to argue with the army s first female commando turned wild wellness instructor and therapeutic forest practitioner Pip Wright I m at Glen Dye a Highland estate on the eastern edge of the Cairngorms National Park with a very modern take on wellbeing and a newly launched School of Wild Wellness and Bushcraft For my first morning I m with Pip foraging and forest bathing a bimble as she puts it beside the peaty brown River Dye On the other side of the river a huge pink billboard asks Shall we just love each other It s late in the season and we ve missed most of the mushrooms but there are still plenty of plants if you know where to look Like under a hedge Bending down Pip picks a few small green leaves for me to taste Wood sorrel is packed with potassium and great in salads It has an almost citrussy tang A patch of half dead dock leaves and nettles catches her eye The dock leaf flowers are now stringy and brown You can grind them down to make flour which is good for stodgy baking like brownies she tells me rubbing the flowers between her fingers The leaves are also a good source of vitamin C and an alternative to spinach I ve heard that you should pick nettles only in the spring but she uses them year round in soup and smoothies They are so densely packed with nutrients adding them to your diet on a regular basis really boosts your immune system and they re free she smiles People think you need a lot of knowledge to go foraging but everyone knows what a nettle is And the proper way to use a dock leaf You have to chew the leaves before rubbing them onto your skin Or peel back the small leaf at the base of the plant and you ll find a gooey substance like aloe vera It acts as a cooling gel when you rub it onto the nettle

wilderness venture With acres of woodland hill moor and river there s forest bathing tree hugging hiking and cold water therapy aka wild swimming on the doorstep And wild wellness fits snugly into estate owners Charlie and Caroline Gladstone s slightly offbeat philosophy and vision After converting a number of workers cottages and the old steading into a handful of vibrant vintage chic hideaways they re also the founders of homeware brand Pedlars they turned their hand to a series of camps or mini festivals themed around wild food crafts and wellness Not a huge departure they also established the Good Life Experience festival with Cerys Matthews back in an eclectic celebration of singalongs storytelling and campfire cooking on their other estate in North Wales There has been the odd stumbling block along the way The launch of the camps coincided with the pandemic but creative thinking is part of their DNA Daughter Xanthe reinvented the wild food camps into a series of guest chef residencies with foraging food demos and supper club feasting And now the wild wellness school offers bespoke wellbeing sessions in the wilderness along with the opportunity to create your own DIY wild wellness retreat The concept of wild wellness is one we re all becoming more familiar with As we learnt during lockdown spending time outdoors is vital for our mental and physical health You don t need to visit a spa Just go outside for minutes says Pip as she leads me along a rough moorland track before turning uphill into the woods We very rarely engage all our senses which is why being outdoors is so good for us looking at what s around us listening to the birds feeling the air on our faces And tasting The woodland floor is blanketed with wild blueberry bushes and we snack on nature s bounty as Pip unpacks a small mat from her backpack and instructs me to find a sit spot For minutes I m to sit with my back against a tree empty my mind and focus on nature Wandering off I find a gnarly trunk balance the mat on the springy vegetation and still my mind I listen to birds singing the wind rustling through branches I touch damp earth and experience a deep stillness and connection I could happily have stayed under the tree for hours but there is more to do Meandering back to the rustic open sided camp kitchen where the food demos are held we light a fire with a flint and steel brew a pot of dandelion root coffee it has an earthy nutty flavour and is said to be good for the liver and prepare to make a pine resin balm Melting a few nubs of beeswax over a small stove we gradually stir in olive oil infused with pine resin The balm is antimicrobial and increases circulation and can be used for scrapes scratches and dry skin Adding an essential oil I choose sage for muscular aches and pains can turn it into a muscle rub or decongestant Glen Dye s cottages and cabins each have a private hot tub but North Lodge where I m staying also has its own river cabin along with a wood fired hot tub bath shaped with a chimney hidden among the trees on the water s edge and for the afternoon s activities I m experimenting with DIY wellness Just preparing the tub is an exercise in mindfulness as it takes time read hours to heat it You need to fill it with a hose fetch kindling and logs from the wood store light the fire and feed the flames until eventually steam starts to rise from the water Undressing in the cosy wood burner warmed cabin I pad across a carpet of fallen leaves slip off my robe and sink into the water for a warm woodland soak while gazing out onto the river rushing peaty red like oxtail soup beneath the fir trees feathery fronds The dramatic rock formations of the Highlands can make for scrambly hikes The next day Pip has chillier water based activities lined up It s been raining all night and the river is too dangerous for wild swimming but not cold water therapy However first we head to the river cabin for a dynamic breathwork session With the fire crackling and the rain pattering on the tin roof we sit on rugs on the floor as Pip guides me through some breathing exercises Most of us don t breathe properly into our diaphragms and are guilty of shallow breathing and breathing through our mouths Nasal breathing filters pollution and also puts air into our lungs at the right pressure We practise a couple of powerful Wim Hoff techniques and the horse stance Spreading our legs hip distance apart then squatting arms at chest height we punch the air away to each side as we exhale The last exercise is a Haka breathing in bent double then exhaling as we fling our arms up over our heads to get the circulation moving With cold water therapy she explains you are consciously putting your body under stress by immersing yourself in icy water but your mind is in control The idea is that when you encounter a stressful situation in the future your brain will recognise that it can deal with it It s also a short sharp reboot and flushes out your system as all the blood surges to your core and then back to your limbs as you warm up Wrapped in huge dry robes and wellies we tramp down through a field to Pip s wild swimming spot picking spruce needles on the way which she adds to a flask of hot water to make a warming pine needle tea said to stimulate circulation and boost the immune system for after our dip On the riverbank we do the Haka and the horse before hanging our robes on a branch Following Pip into the icy water I sink first up to my waist and then submerge my shoulders Just breathe she says her voice calm and reassuring and I do My whole body tingles but I breathe in and out feeling strangely calm The two minutes is up before I know it Clambering out of the water I grab a towel and we walk up and down the sandy shore The tingling is like violent pins and needles but I ve never felt so alive The blood rushes back to our skin in a vivid red blush as Pip pours us mugs of pine needle tea and wrapping ourselves in the dry robes we start to tramp back up the hill to the wood fired sauna As we walk and she talks me through the science she has a degree in sports science and human biology we pass another giant billboard Large pink letters on a purple background declare I think you are the most beautiful creature in the world And I m flooded with a wonderful sense of wellbeing That s wild wellness right there I think wise words woven through the woods glorious affirmations that make you break out in a smile Left Relaxing with a good book at the firepit Photograph by Flore
