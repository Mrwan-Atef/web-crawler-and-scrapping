read Share The Step Pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara makes an incredible day trip from Cairo Â Angel Villalba Getty Images The capital of Egypt has more than enough charms to fill a travelerâ s itinerary and even more fascinating sites stretch far out from Cairo in all directions Big hitter cities like Luxor and Aswan are farther away and require more time but a handful of must see destinations can be done on a day trip from Cairo Pick out your favorite pyramid in Giza and Saqqara Travel time minutes from Cairo to Giza minutes from Giza to Saqqara Advertisement As the only remaining wonder of the ancient world the Pyramids of Giza usually get the most face time from visitors but Egypt s oldest pyramid is actually just a little farther south from the capital If you want to fill an entire day with just pharaonic burial grounds start out with the Giza Necropolis after breakfast to hike around the pyramids of Menkaure Khafre and the Great Pyramid of Khufu Check at the ticket office which pyramids have inner chambers open to the public as it changes daily and even hourly Surprisingly the inner chamber of the smallest pyramid Menkaure is the largest and most interesting with three different levels You can also head out into the desert from there to hunt for an iconic photo op with all three pyramids Exit the plateau past the Sphinx into the hustle of Giza to find a taxi or pick up an Uber If you forgot to pack water or a sandwich for lunch now is the time to pick something up at one of the many shops outside the walls of the site before starting the mile drive to Saqqara which has no good food options Once in Saqqara head to the Step Pyramid of Djoser the oldest pyramid in Egypt and one that offers a unique aesthetic contrast to the smoother Giza pyramids Built as a sort of architectural experiment during the reign of Djoser BC the first pharaoh of the Third Dynasty the Step Pyramid was the first burial chamber to be built from limestone instead of bricks of clay and at was the tallest structure at the time How to get to Giza and Saqqara from Cairo The easiest way to visit Giza and Saqqara is to join an organized tour or hire your own private guide and driver or taxi for the day You can use Uber to get to Giza but not Saqqara which is farther away Dahshur s Bent Pyramid is worth a stop on a day trip from Cairo Â Upperhall Ltd robertharding Getty Images Check out little visited pyramids and an ancient capital at Dahshur and Memphis Travel time hour minutes from Cairo to Dahshur minutes from Dahshur to Memphis South of Saqqara you can visit the lesser known Red Pyramid and Bent Pyramid both named after their most unique characteristics before heading to Memphis to see Egyptâ s former capital during the Old Kingdom For history buffs the name Memphis is synonymous with pharaonic Egypt and most pyramids built around Cairo were raised while Memphis was the seat of power While little remains of the ancient city there is a worthwhile open air museum and a sphinx Advertisement How to get to Dahshur and Memphis from Cairo Joining an organized tour that includes Dahshur and Memphis or hiring your own private guide and driver or taxi for the day is the best way to visit See the museums architecture and Mediterranean seafront on a day trip to Alexandria Â Getty Images Explore Alexandria Egyptâ s second city Travel time hours Cairo may be the capital but in the minds of poets scholars and artists of the and â Alexandria and its crashing waves will always contain the restless soul of Egypt As the setting of Nobel Prizeâ winning author Naguib Mahfouzâ s novel Miramar the city is its own character and visiting even today itâ s easy to see how it charmed not only Egyptians but the artists and scholars of Europe as well Head to the Alexandria National Museum an impressive colonial structure housing a carefully curated selection of artifacts that tell the cityâ s tumultuous history through the Pharaonic Roman Coptic and Islamic eras Take a minute walk toward the water to the cityâ s center of culture and learning the Bibliotheca Alexandrina With its unique sloping disk shape and exterior walls decorated with dozens of different scripts itâ s an architectural wonder Check out the main reading hall and take a tour From there you can take a leisurely stroll along the Corniche stopping at one of the many cafes or restaurants to enjoy the waterfront before arriving at Fort Qaitbay a beautifully maintained harbor citadel and popular hangout spot Pick one of the cityâ s top rated fish restaurants like Kadoura or

Ramses Station in Cairo Discover a desert mirage at Al Fayoum Travel time hours The popular oasis destination of Al Fayoum miles south of Cairo rightfully deserves at least two days of exploration but if you re pressed for time you can still take in a number of the areaâ s natural wonders during daylight hours Leave Cairo early enough to beat morning traffic and first stop at Karanis miles north of Fayoum city center After admiring the ancient ruins which include two Graeco Roman temples move on to the natural wonders of Al Fayoum including the Wadi Rayyan Protected Area with its waterfalls rowboat tours to the middle of the lake and wildlife in the surrounding national park Birdwatchers should be on the lookout for eagles falcons and migrant birds The visitors center on the lakefront can help with any questions Afterwards head to the pottery school in Tunis village to mingle with local artists and stop in the many pottery studios to pick up a gift The pottery center is a good point from which to explore the vast Lake Qarun where during fall and winter months you can spot flamingoes and other birds resting before heading farther south How to get to Al Fayoum from Cairo Many
