after sunset Dinner is eaten later than usual and many wake up early for a filling breakfast before dawn Although you will not be expected to observe the fast eating in public is still frowned upon Hence many restaurants are closed during the day until iftar the evening meal when the fast is broken â though if you call ahead to restaurants in tourist areas you may have luck Plan ahead load up on snacks in the market to eat indoors make arrangements for breakfast or lunch in the privacy of your guesthouse and ask locals about a good place to enjoy iftar Moroccan dining etiquette tips Depending on the type of dining setting you find yourself in during your Moroccan stay itâ s important to pocket a few customary etiquette tips In many settings meals are served at low round tables with communal style dishes designed for everyone to dig in Moroccans typically eat with their right hand â skipping the silverware â as the left hand is traditionally reserved for cleaning purposes Reaching across the table is also a no go in favor of only accepting food that is passed to you And for those with the gift of gab youâ ll be glad to know that eating in silence is rude so chat away This family style experience makes dining in Morocco a treat that feels like the comfort of home After dinner consider taking a stroll a popular activity often enjoyed by locals and visitors keen on embracing this leisurely aspect of Moroccan culture Typically spanning several hours â between afternoon tea time to post meal wind down â the culinary experiences of Morocco are best enjoyed by
