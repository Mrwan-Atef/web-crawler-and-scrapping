the blood here for centuries Hamburg was a stridently independent city state and free port a kind of European Singapore on whose docks sailors and goods from distant continents mingled You can

Gateway to the World endures armadas of container ships still dock here forests of cranes still fidget along the wharfs At ground level too ordinary visitors can witness how saltwater has shaped the city At the centre of Hamburg are the UNESCO listed warehouses of the Speicherstadt district where merchandise from coffee to carpets was unloaded in the and centuries and restaurants and cafes now also ply their trade in the You can tour the nightclubs of Hamburg s legendary thoroughfare the Reeperbahn where shore sick sailors once came for salty adventures though landlubbers outnumber them

extraordinary concert hall its roof contoured like rolling swells The profits of ocean going trade have helped make Hamburg rich since the century its skyline is marked by some of Europe s tallest and most opulent churches their spires collectively resembling the masts of a flotilla Hamburg s futuristic concert hall Elbphilharmonie sits in the middle of the river Elbe Photograph by Christian Kerber

utilitarian fish sandwich that s Hamburg s civic delicacy usually sold at a profoundly democratic price of under And you can feel it standing on one of the city s many bridges watching the tide ebb and flow through Hamburg The water is a perfect metaphor for the city it laps against restless dynamic and forever on the move What to see and do in Hamburg Miniatur Wonderland Hamburg is a city built
