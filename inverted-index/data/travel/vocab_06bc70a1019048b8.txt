sumo wrestling and kabuki theater to cutting edge contemporary art and on a more playful note giant robots and anime characters Here are the best neighborhoods to explore in Tokyo We recommend picking just a couple of areas close together to discover in one day The city is huge and while public transportation is effortlessly smooth you donâ t want to spend half the day getting around Marunouchi is home to Tokyo s Imperial Palace golaizola Getty Images Marunouchi and Nihombashi Best neighborhoods at the heart of Tokyo Most visitors are naturally drawn to the city s geographical and cultural centerpiece the Imperial Palace â you could easily spend a day exploring this historic complex and the surrounding streets Immediately east of the palace the high powered business district of Marunouchi has blossomed in the past decade with a slew of new and revamped buildings housing high end hotels shops and restaurants Tree lined Naka dÅ ri has morphed into one of Tokyo s most pleasant thoroughfares â the ideal way to saunter from Tokyo Station s handsomely reappointed red brick frontage to YÅ rakuchÅ taking in the dramatic architecture of the Tokyo International Forum along the way

are great for train journeys or picnics in the Imperial Palace East Garden Nihombashi the location of Tokyo s original fish market for years is also a top culinary destination with many venerable

come cheap Book a night at Hoshinoya Tokyo for a luxurious ryokan traditional Japanese inn experience right in the center of the city Mitsui Garden Hotel Nihonbashi Premier is near many of the

in the world It s a compact area but you could easily spend a day here sashaying from Mikimoto and Louis Vuitton to Uniqlo Ginza is also strong on small commercial art galleries and creative spaces sponsored by major corporations like Sony Nissan and Mitsubishi A major attraction is the cityâ s dedicated kabuki theater Kabukiza devoted to Japan s ancient tradition of dance drama The fantastical facade â a contemporary reimagination of a traditional Japanese theater â and the rooftop garden are worth a look even if you re not drawn by the plays performed here The famous wholesale fish fruit and vegetable market at nearby Tsukiji shifted across Tokyo Bay to a new home in Toyosu in However the area is still well worth visiting for the mouthwatering array of food related businesses that fill the area around the old Tsukiji marketplace formerly known as the â Outer Marketâ Ginza is famed for its high end sushi counters but amid the expense account establishments there are also plenty of more affordable dining and drinking options including classy ramen bars The neighborhood s tiny and exclusive bars can easily bleed your wallet dry should you manage to gain access in the first place but there are affordable places to drink the night away as well look for bars under the railway tracks from YÅ rakuchÅ to Shimbashi Where to stay in Ginza and Tsukiji Ginzaâ s central location and prestigious reputation generally mean pricey hotels including the Tokyo EDITION â a deluxe accommodation with lavish in house dining Muji Hotel Ginza is a boutique hotel entirely furnished with products from Muji Japan s favorite lifestyle store There are also some affordable business hotel chains and capsule hotels catering to travelers on a budget The sophisticated neighborhood of Akasaka

Roppongi and Akasaka Both Roppongi and Akasaka are great places to base yourself with good transport connections and a wealth of top class eating drinking and shopping options on the doorstep Go high end at Hotel Å kura if your budget allows but there are also plenty of mid range business hotels The cherry blossom lined Meguro gawa in Tokyo s Meguro neighborhood Shutterstock Ebisu and Meguro Best neighborhoods for peace and quiet Ebisu and Meguro are gateways to a series of residential districts some artsy some upscale some both where Tokyo takes on a more human scale The sights here are smaller and generally less crowded than those in the center There are some excellent art museums to explore including the TOP Museum the cityâ s photography museum and the Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum Trendsetting boutiques abound in Daikanyama and Naka Meguro Bookmark this area for a day when you re looking to take it easy and set aside time for a stroll along the cherry tree lined canal Meguro gawa After hours Ebisu has a dynamic dining and bar scene that s worth checking out even if you pass on the sights In fact this is the one occasion where you may have to contend with crowds â popular restaurants and bars are packed most nights of the week The lively Ebisu bar scene is particularly popular with young professionals most places to drink are small sometimes little more than a service counter and it s fun to bounce from one to the next Where to stay in Ebisu and Meguro Ebisu and Meguro are both stops on the convenient Yamanote train line and you ll avoid the overwhelming crowds and disorienting sprawl of Shinjuku and Shibuya Both make great bases for travelers In addition to the usual business hotels there is the stylish Ebisuholic near the station and comfortable capsules at Â C pronounced do C People walk across the famous Shibuya crossing Juergen Sack Getty Images Shibuya Best neighborhood for youth culture Shibuya hits you over the head with its sheer presence the continuous flow of people the glowing video screens and the tangible buzz This energy is perfectly summed up by its top attraction the busy junction known as Shibuya Crossing This neighborhood is currently undergoing a massive transformation evidenced by new developments such as Shibuya Stream a skyscraper complex marking the junction of two buried Tokyo rivers Advertisement Shibuya is a place that warrants a late start Come for lunch or later â it is above all an entertainment district and it really comes alive at night There are dance clubs live music venues and movie theaters galore While weekends are the busiest youâ ll find people from all over Tokyo here any night of the week and you may find yourself drawn back night after night by bars and karaoke parlors that stay open until dawn If you re keen to immerse yourself in urban Tokyo and its nightlife Shibuya makes for a great base and it s got excellent transport links too For food hang out around Shibuya Center gai which is packed with fast food joints cheap izakaya Japanese pub eateries and chain restaurants aimed at a younger cash strapped crowd â not a bad thing Where to stay in Shibuya Shibuya has some good accommodation options among them boutique hotels such as Hotel Indigo flash packer hostels such as Turn Table and cabin style capsule hotels such as the Millennials Wise Owl Hotels offers dorm style rooms Meiji jingÅ a torii entrance gate to a ShintÅ shrine at Yoyogi kÅ en in Harajuku Marco Taliani de Marchio Shutterstock Harajuku and Aoyama Best neighborhoods for boutique shopping Harajuku is one of Tokyo s biggest draws thanks to the grand century shrine Meiji jingÅ and adjacent Yoyogi kÅ en among the city s most popular parks It s also Tokyo s real life catwalk a world renowned fashion destination where the ultra chic and chic in training come to browse and be seen Neighboring Aoyama meanwhile is a shopping and dining district for the city s fashionable elite Many boutiques in both districts â and along the boulevard Omote sandÅ that runs between them â have been designed by influential architects Harajuku is a neighborhood that rewards an early start Meiji jingÅ can get very busy so the earlier you get here the more likely you are to experience the kind of serene atmosphere that does the shrine justice Shopping is of course a major attraction for many locals included Harajuku is also famous for being the location where foreign franchises drop their first Tokyo outlet which usually attracts a lot of media buzz and some huge lines There are boutiques from major Japanese fashion brands in Aoyama and edgier looks can be found in the boutiques among the winding side streets on either side of Omote sandÅ Then there s the trendy teen shopping strip Takeshita dÅ ri which by late afternoon will be positively packed with the young and hip As you d expect from a trendy shopping district Harajuku and Aoyama have lots of great inexpensive lunch spots covering a variety of cuisines Both neighborhoods become pretty quiet after the shops close for the day there are a handful of places with glowing windows after dark but you have to know where to find them Where to stay in Harajuku and Aoyama These two districts have very few sleeping options which is a shame because both would otherwise be attractive places to stay with lots of cafes and restaurants and good transportation links on both the JR Yamanote line and the subway You can try nearby Shibuya which offers more choice KÅ enji is a largely residential neighborhood in West Tokyo Page Light Studios Shutterstock West Tokyo Best neighborhood for going local During the boom years of the the neighborhoods west of Shinjuku were developed as commuter towns for the capital s rapidly expanding population with connections to the center on the ChÅ Å train line Today they feel like time capsules of mid century architecture and urban planning Neighborhoods such as Nakano KÅ enji Asagaya and Nishi Ogikubo are immensely popular with counter culture types who reject the constant construction and upward trajectory of the city center Their tastes are reflected in the eclectic shops restaurants and bars found here What makes this part of Tokyo so fascinating is that each of the neighborhoods has developed its own unique culture Nakano is popular with otaku fans of anime and manga while KÅ enji just one stop away attracts street artists and social activists As these are largely residential districts there are few splashy must see sights exploring this area is more about getting a feel for how Tokyoites see Tokyo The one big attraction out here is the enchanting Ghibli Museum dedicated to Japan s most famous animated movie studio It would be tempting to write these residential neighborhoods off as sleepy however they are anything but Each has its own nomiyagai eating and drinking area that draws locals in the evenings Of all the districts on the ChÅ Å train line KÅ enji has the most going on after dark with lots of shops that stay open late plus restaurants bars and live music venues Where to stay in West Tokyo Staying out west can save you a little money as chain hotels are a bit cheaper out here It s also a chance for a more local experience in these largely residential neighborhoods BnA Hotel in KÅ enji which has works by local artists on the walls is our top pick here Having to take the often crowded ChÅ Å line to get anywhere can be a drag but it does give you direct access to hubs such as Shinjuku and Tokyo Station in Marunouchi Views across the city to Mt Fuji from the skyscraper district of Nishi Shinjuku shigemi okano Shutterstock Shinjuku Best neighborhood for all day exploration Shinjuku is almost a city within the city Developed in the latter half of the century it s become synonymous with Tokyo itself The breadth and scale of this post war development are simply awesome â more than three million people pass through Shinjuku train station every day Clustered in and around this enormous train station are many department and electronics stores which make easy work of shopping for souvenirs plus plenty of restaurants and food courts On the east side of the station the grassy oasis of Shinjuku gyoen is great for a picnic and a breather pick up snacks in one of the department store basement food halls Shinjuku works neatly as a day to night destination Start with the skyscraper district of Nishi Shinjuku â you ll have the streets to yourself if you come after to avoid the morning rush Morning is usually the clearest time of day and thus your best chance to see Mt Fuji from the free observatories atop the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building Shinjuku s east side home to the cityâ s largest nightlife district really shines at night â quite literally Come here at dusk as natural light gives way to arresting artificial neon and Tokyo takes on an alluring glow There are myriad bars izakaya karaoke parlors music spots and more to keep you entertained until dawn While Friday nights are the most crowded Shinjuku buzzes every night of the week There is a huge spread of eating options and there s little you can t get here The neighborhood is so large in fact that it contains multiple sub districts Shinjuku nichÅ me is Tokyo s LGBTIQ enclave Shinjuku sanchÅ me is full of izakaya popular with commuters stopping off on their way home and the tiny bars of Golden Gai are a draw for artists musicians and increasingly travelers Running through the middle of this is Yasukuni dÅ ri the main artery electrified with a thousand glowing signs Where to stay in Shinjuku Shinjuku is a convenient base popular with travelers and with options at all price levels Hole up at hostel slash reading room Book

running alongside Soto bÅ ri the former outer moat of Edo Castle and the Kanda River one of the cityâ s main waterways To the west there s the charming old geisha district of Kagurazaka and the KÅ rakuen area home to the gorgeous traditional garden Koishikawa KÅ rakuen and the Tokyo Dome baseball stadium Further east browse the bookstores of JimbÅ chÅ the traditional restaurants of Kanda and the electronics pop culture and contemporary craft emporiums of Akihabara Kagurazaka has many exclusive extravagantly priced restaurants but there are some attractive affordable options too Once a busy geisha teahouse area this is now one of the most atmospheric parts of the city to wander around at night and find a nice cafe or bar Where to stay in KÅ rakuen and Akihabara KÅ rakuen Kanda Kagurazaka and Akihabara are all central locations with good transport connections and great eating and nightlife on hand This area has plenty of budget and midrange accommodations Within walking distance of downtown Akihabara near Asakusa bashi subway station is a branch of the futuristic Henn na Hotel a unique hotel staffed by robot receptionists AND Hostel Akihabara has a capsule style dormitory Keep an eye out for the reopening of the art deco Hilltop Hotel a one time hangout for the Tokyo literati currently undergoing renovations The century garden of Rikugi en is a highlight of the Yanesen neighborhood Takashi Images Shutterstock Ueno and Yanesen Best neighborhoods for museums Ueno is the cultural heart of Tokyo Its central park Ueno kÅ en has the city s greatest concentration of museums including the Tokyo National Museum The neighboring areas of Yanaka Nezu and Sendagi are collectively known as Yanesen â a charming part of Tokyo where it feels as though time stopped several decades ago Transporting you even further back in time is the beautiful century strolling garden Rikugi en the highlight of the Komagome area Ueno isnâ t much of a culinary destination although there are some lovely traditional restaurants in and around the park and also in Yanesen With the exception of the area immediately around Ueno Station these districts are pretty quiet at night though Yanaka has a few hip hangouts Where to stay in Ueno and Yanesen As one of the major gateways in and out of Tokyo Ueno is well stocked with business hotels â Nohga Hotel is the most attractive of the bunch Yanesen meanwhile has Tokyoâ s best selection of ryokan Family run Ryokan Sawanoya which has a wonderfully welcoming vibe has long been a traveler favorite Grids Tokyo Ueno Hotel Hostel is a budget option near Ueno Station SensÅ ji a Buddhist temple complex in Asakusa marcobrivio gallery Shutterstock Asakusa and Sumida River Best neighborhoods for tradition On the banks of the Sumida River Tokyo s eastern neighborhoods have an old fashioned feel with venerable temples and shrines lovely gardens traditional restaurants and artisan shops Zone in on Asakusa s famously atmospheric Buddhist temple complex SensÅ ji and the sumo hot spot of RyÅ goku home to the ancient sport s main Tokyo stadium and a top class history museum the Edo Tokyo Museum closed for renovations until spring Asakusa is one of Tokyo s principal tourist destinations and during the day it s pretty much jam packed If you step off the main drag though you ll find fewer tourists and the craft shops and small restaurants that have long defined these quarters Walking around the peaceful neighborhoods east of the Sumida River gives a good feel for the culture of old Tokyo These districts are not without their pockets of hipster cool either thanks to cheaper rents compared to the city center Asakusa offers an abundance of street food stalls selling unpretentious Japanese dishes generally at modest prices You ll also find some of the city s longest running and most traditional restaurants here Overall this neighborhood is one of Tokyo s quieter areas for nightlife and it gets even snoozier on the east side of the Sumida River Where to stay in Asakusa and Sumida River Asakusa is Tokyo s budget traveler center If you re looking to meet up with other travelers this is the best place to stay There are loads of hostels to choose from â our favorite is Nui whose first floor cafe is a popular local hangout There are also several business class and tourist oriented hotels here as well as some excellent ryokan such as Cyashitsu Ryokan Asakusa The main downside of staying in this area is its relative distance from other central Tokyo districts The Unicorn Gundam statue in Odaiba MasaPhoto Shutterstock Odaiba and Tokyo Bay Best neighborhoods for families In central Tokyo itâ s easy to forget this city started as a seaside town This is not the case in Odaiba a collection of artificial islands on Tokyo Bay One of Odaiba s biggest selling points â in addition to its views of the bay and the Tokyo skyline â is its family friendly feel Attractions include the hands on National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation which has live demonstrations of humanoid robots the augmented reality arcade Tokyo Joypolis and a massive statue of the anime character Unicorn Gundam â perhaps the most only in Tokyo sight imaginable Adjacent to Odaiba is the island of Toyosu home to the city s new wholesale market which replaced the iconic Tsukiji Market in The best place to eat around Tokyo Bay is at the new Toyosu Market which has several floors of restaurants â among them some truly excellent sushi shops naturally and some superior shokudÅ inexpensive casual restaurants and cafes Odaiba s malls are packed with mostly uninspiring but family friendly food courts and chain restaurants Odaiba is a daytime destination and has little to offer at night beyond expensive and somewhat old fashioned hotel bars which admittedly have good bay views although the late closing immersive teamLab Planets sensory exhibition has become a stand out and promises to be around until the end of Where to stay in Odaiba and Tokyo Bay Accommodation options in Odaiba and around Tokyo Bay have improved in recent years with options including resorts business hotels and â ideal for families â affordable self contained apartments Unless Odaiba is the focus of your visit to Tokyo however it might be better to base yourself elsewhere and visit for the day Advertisement
