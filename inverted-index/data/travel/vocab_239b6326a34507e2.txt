What is Omicron and why is there heightened concern Omicron was first detected in South Africa s Gauteng Province in late November Since then the World Health Organization WHO has classified Omicron as a variant of concern along with Alpha Beta Gamma and Delta Viruses are constantly changing including the one that causes COVID These changes occur over time and can lead to the emergence of variants that may have new characteristics Ongoing analysis shows Omicron is the most contagious variant to date It shares many key mutations with previous variants of concern but it has accumulated a dozen novel mutations on its spike protein the part of the virus that is essential for infecting human cells Overall Omicron has mutations some of which could infect cells faster and transmit more easily from person to person Here s why you shouldn t panic over the Omicron variant Positive cases in the region where Omicron was first detected increased from less than one percent to more than percent in three weeks Despite mounting concerns White House chief medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci says that he doesn t foresee a lockdown in the U S The CDC says that vaccines continue to reduce a person s risk of contracting the virus that causes COVID and are highly effective against severe illness Although research is still being done some early studies suggest booster shots are at least percent effective at preventing severe illness caused by Omicron Moderna announced Monday that preliminary data shows their half dose booster shot increases antibodies against Omicron Still only one in six eligible Americans have received a booster worrying health officials How does the coronavirus spread As the CDC outlines COVID spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes nose or mouth In some circumstances droplets may contaminate surfaces People who are closer than six feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected Remember the safety basics While there is no current need for Omicron specific boosters early data indicates that a booster dose of either Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can restore antibody levels to their peak values providing enhanced protection against Omicron Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is required in indoor areas of public transportation including airplanes and indoors in U S transportation hubs including airports The CDC recommends that you check your destination s COVID situation before traveling The CDC actively updates warnings against international travel and cautions about travel within the U S Best advice is to delay travel until you are fully vaccinated Discover how booster shots can help protect you from Omicron If you are not fully vaccinated and must travel get tested both before and after your trip If you re concerned about your own potential exposure but can t test and quarantine before a holiday trip hold joint festivities outdoors keep six feet apart and stay masked at all times Related health and safety measures outlined by the World Health Organization include washing your hands well avoiding touching your face coughing and sneezing into your elbow disinfecting frequently touched items like your phone and staying home if you re sick When should you not travel The CDC recommends that you should not travel if you have been exposed to COVID unless you are fully vaccinated or recovered from COVID in the past days you are sick you tested positive for COVID and haven t ended isolation even if you are fully vaccinated you are waiting for results of a COVID test If your test comes back positive while you are at your destination you will need to isolate and postpone your return until it s safe generally until you have taken several consecutive negative PCR tests Your travel companions may need to self quarantine Consider whether the benefits of travel outweigh the risk that you might spread the virus Can travel insurance protect you or your trip Travel insurance and even credit cards can protect you if you must cancel or change your trip By far the most flexible option is a Cancel For Any Reason CFAR policy It can help recoup as much as percent of your trip s cost but it can be pricey Standard coverage can cost about percent of your trip cost but CFAR can push that up to percent Experts recommend doing your homework and contacting an agent with specific questions long before you pack your bags Sites

December My mother is and healthy but I m still concerned Photograph by Brandon Bell Getty Images How to deal with masking and non maskers Wearing masks when traveling on planes trains and other forms of transit continues to be one of the cheapest easiest and most effective ways to zap your risk of catching COVID The CDC recommends wearing them inside in areas with high numbers of COVID cases and anytime you will be in close contact with others who are not fully vaccinated The U S government extended the mask mandate on airplanes and trains until March For details on wearing masks check out the CDC s extensive guide Although cloth masks were widely used early in the pandemic due to a PPE shortage there is now an ample supply of surgical and masks These block at least percent of micron particles and are more effective at preventing disease than cloth masks Masking customs and local laws differ from state to state and country to country The best way to assure protection in an indoor congregate setting is to cover your face If people around you on an airplane or crowded place aren t masking you could politely ask anyone who gets too close would you mind giving us a bit more space please but it might be easier just to move away It s likely not worth the risk or the stress to confront a stranger If you can t escape the situation ask a store manager or flight attendant for help Do you need to take a test If you re symptom free and following stringent health rules at home you generally don t need to test before leaving for domestic travel But travel to some international destinations requires a recent negative test in addition to proof of vaccination several European countries including France and Switzerland require a recent negative COVID test for entrance usually within hours There are several types of COVID tests with molecular ones like RT PCR tests seen as most reliable At home rapid tests which U S President Joe Biden s ays insurance will pay for soon can provide some assurance that you aren t actively infectious If you can afford it and you can find them get rapid at home tests My wife refers to them as day passes said COVID expert and former White House advisor Andy Slavitt on a recent In The Bubble podcast Take it and that day you re pretty clear you re not infectious If you re coming over spring for a box Still you could have a negative result and still be infected with and pass along COVID After exposure the average person takes about five days to develop measurable levels of the virus known as the incubation window This window doesn t always match the symptoms which can take up to days to appear In the meantime people could pass the virus to anyone they come into close contact with Some percent of COVID transmission comes from those without symptoms Navigating air travel Road trips have soared in popularity during the pandemic and driving to your holiday destination while avoiding contact with others does mean less indoor time with strangers than flying But many experts say airplanes are safer than you think High tech filtration and low tech masks make flying safer The air you breathe in flight though not necessarily entirely virus free is much cleaner than the air in restaurants bars stores and most homes Remember that COVID most often spreads when people come in close contact increasing their exposure to hefty respiratory droplets or smaller particles called aerosols that linger in the air over a few feet Airplane ventilation systems filter out percent of those particles Which plane seat is safest How to choose the least germy spot The bigger danger is the airport which presents the highest risk of catching the coronavirus during air travel The labyrinth of human bodies means you ll want to practice social distancing mask wearing and good hygiene bring hand sanitizer in check in and boarding lines If you re hungry eat far away from other people On the flight open your overhead vent The gust coming out is not only filtered it also creates an invisible buffer between you and others Snacking or drinking en route should be OK as long as you don t take your mask off for longer
