Paraguayan cuisine goes gourmet at this restaurant Amy Booth Dec min read Share Classic Paraguayan dishes get a gourmet twist at Pakuri Â Courtesy of Pakuri Paraguayan food might not enjoy the international fame of Peruvian ceviche or Argentine asado but a stylish restaurant in is determined to put local cuisine on the map The formula Time honored local dishes and a traditional oven in the garden Classic Paraguayan dishes get a gourmet twist at Pakuri Â Courtesy of Pakuri Advertisement At Pakuri hearty family favorites get a refreshing contemporary makeover The restaurant is named after the fruit of the platonia tree which grows in the humid rainforests of South America It was the favorite fruit of chef Sofia Pfannlâ s grandmother who grew it on her land and even named her fields after them â We felt like there was a gap people werenâ t trying Paraguayan food â explains sommelier Jose Miguel Burga who co owns the restaurant with Pfannl The pair were inspired to open their own place while working in a restaurant in New York Surrounded by international cuisine they felt Paraguay wasnâ t doing enough to promote its local food Back in they opened Pakuri in May Enjoy fresh baked bread from a tatakua Â Loli Ferres Pakuri The first bite The meal starts with complementary mandioca balls with tomato Crusty round chickpea flour sourdough bread are served with miel de caÃ a a sort of sugarcane â honeyâ and butter carefully singed just enough to create a smoky caramelized flavor Pfannl is coeliac so the entire restaurant is gluten free The bread is baked in a traditional Paraguayan wood oven known as a tatakua which means â hole of fireâ in the indigenous language GuaranÃ The restaurantâ s own tatakua is a giant white sphere in the tropical garden Taller than a person it has a small round metal door that makes it look strangely like a diving bell A Paraguayan classic Also prepared in the tatakua is one of Paraguayâ s best known foods sopa paraguaya Paraguayan soup The name is famously misleading itâ s solid and closer to cornbread than a soup There are competing stories about how Paraguay came to have solid soup according to Pfannl Some say Paraguayâ s first president Carlos Antonio had a cook who accidentally added too much cornflour to a soup To disguise her mistake she put the dish in the oven and baked it solid and the president loved it so much that it became a national favorite Others say it comes from a Spanish ensopado of bread soaked in milk adapted to use corn Regardless the sopa paraguaya served at Pakuri is so smooth and creamy you could almost take it for soup if it werenâ t for the crispy crust Pfannlâ s special recipe uses polenta and although some versions use animal fat Pakuriâ s is vegetarian Paraguayan cuisine is often stodgy intended to fuel workers heading out for long days in the fields Advertisement â That gets really heavy â Burga says â We wanted something lighter and fresher â The filled pasta is a great example Stuffed with crunchy greens and served in a light smoked beetroot sauce with a fruity aroma it has bite without being chewy To avoid using wheat the pasta is made from corn tapioca and rice flour with corn and tapioca starch The presentation is simple but the effect is delicious Skipping dessert would be a mistake at Pakuri Â Courtesy of Pakuri Save room for dessert If heavy is what youâ re after youâ ll find it on the dessert menu Thick slices of syrupy candied papaya are served with little cubes of Paraguayan soft cheese tofu and mature cheese ice cream If you think cheese ice cream sounds odd donâ t knock it â til youâ ve tried it it blends wonderfully with the fruit Raise a glass The drinks menu puts a creative twist on local favorites too CaÃ a a Paraguayan sugar cane spirit is shaken up with fresh fruit juices and local herbs to create stylish drinkable signature cocktails Burga is especially proud of the â Cocido Kaâ ureâ Kaâ ure means drunk or tipsy in GuaranÃ Cocido is a yerba mate drink prepared by burning a mixture of mate and sugar with hot coals before boiling it up with water creating a sort of hot caramel flavored tea At Pakuri they reduce it to a syrup and serve it with caÃ a gin and grapefruit Itâ s served under a bell jar with some of the smoke from the cocido Despite this elaborate preparation neither caÃ a nor cocido are fancy drinks in Paraguay â One day a client came in and ordered kaâ ure and he said â I used to drink this in prison â â Burga says Pakuriâ s architecture Almost as exciting as the food is the building itself Pakuri is an angular contemporary structure made from converted shipping containers Donâ t think this is some hipster popup though it looks more like an upscale hotel and after dark you could be forgiven for thinking it was the outlandish home of some contemporary architect Pfannl and Burga got the idea from a container hotel they saw in Lima that moved to the beach every summer â We were looking at houses but we didnâ t know where and we would have had to refurbish them anyway â Burga says â Then Sofia said â Why donâ t we do it on empty grounds with shipping containers â â Pakuri itself has never been moved although Burga says that it could with a little building work The decor Hanging on the walls are paintings by up and coming Paraguayan artists Some are of birds while others are more obscure geometric images but all represent national motifs in some way according to Burga The hard architectural look is softened out by its setting in a large lush garden of tropical plants and trees Dotted along the bar are graceful cuttings in glass vases The ambiance is wonderful As you would expect from a fine dining establishment this isnâ t somewhere to come for cheap eats in Paraguay One personâ s bill for three courses and a soft drink plus tip came to Paraguayan guaranÃ es USD with cocktails around guaranÃ es USD But if you want to try traditional Paraguayan dishes like youâ ve never had them before Pakuri is hard to beat Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address Subscribe now Subscribe to
