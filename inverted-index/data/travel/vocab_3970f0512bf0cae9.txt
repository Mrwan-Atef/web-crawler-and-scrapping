Ryndam Maasdam Volendam Westerdam Noordam Veendam Statendam Zaandam Select a Ship Close Fodor s Expert Review Cruise Style Premium Ship Size Midsize Holland America Line has enjoyed a distinguished record of traditional cruises world exploration and transatlantic crossings since all facets of its history that are reflected in the fleet s multimillion dollar shipboard art and antiques collections Even the ships names follow a pattern set long ago all end in the suffix dam and are either derived from the names of various dams that cross Holland s rivers important Dutch landmarks or points of the compass The names are even recycled when vessels are retired and some are in their fifth and sixth generation of use Read More Noted for focusing on passenger comfort Holland America Line cruises are classic in design and style and with an infusion of younger adults and families onboard they remain refined without being stuffy or stodgy Following a basic design theme returning passengers feel as at home on the newest Holland America vessels as they do on older ones Top Reasons to Cruise Comfort Ships in the fleet are noted for their cozy and warm atmosphere Consistency From afternoon tea to the chimes that announce dinner each ship in the fleet delivers the expected experience The Promenade A trademark of each ship is its wraparound promenade deck for walking jogging or stretching out in the shade on a padded steamer chair Service It s not unusual for crew members to remember passengers names even if they haven t seen them for years Tradition Rules Holland America Line is one of the most traditional cruise lines and the line s history is an important part of the experience Is This Line Right for You Choose this Line If Don t Choose this Line If You crave relaxation Grab a padded steamer chair on the teak promenade deck and watch the sea pass by You like to go to the movies especially when the popcorn is free You want to bring the kids Areas designed exclusively for children and teens are hot features on all ships You want to party hard Most of the action on these ships ends relatively early Dressing for dinner isn t your thing Passengers tend to ramp up the dress code most evenings You have an aversion to extending tips The line s tipping not required policy has been dropped What to Expect on Board Food Entertainment Fitness Recreation Food Holland America Line chefs led by Master Chef Rudi Sodamin utilize more than different food items on a typical weeklong cruise to create the modern Continental cuisine and traditional favorites served to their passengers Vegetarian options as well as health conscious cuisine are available and special dietary requests can be handled with advance notice The food quality taste and selection have greatly improved in recent years A case in point is the reservations required Pinnacle Grill alternative restaurants where fresh seafood and premium cuts of sustainably raised beef from Washington State s Double R Ranch are used to prepare creative specialty dishes The per person charge for dinner would be worth it for the Dungeness crab cakes starter and dessert alone Other delicious traditions are afternoon tea a Dutch Chocolate Extravaganza and Holland America Line s signature bread pudding Flexible scheduling allows for early or late seatings in the two deck formal restaurants An open seating option from to has been introduced fleetwide Entertainment Entertainment tends to be more Broadway stylish than Las Vegas brash Colorful revues are presented in main show lounges by the ships companies of singers and dancers Other performances might include a range of cabaret acts comedians magicians jugglers and acrobats Live bands play a wide range of musical styles for dancing and listening in smaller lounges and piano bars Movies are shown daily in cinemas that double as the Culinary Arts Centers Holland America Line may never be considered cutting edge but their innovative
