eat and more Brett Atkinson Sep min read Share Remember to cover up in largely conservative Malta especially in churches like the magnificent St Johnâ s in Valletta Matthew Mirabelli for Lonely Planet Compact easy to get around and with a friendly English speaking population Malta is a relaxed and convenient destination filled with pleasures Taking note of a few pre departure tips will make a trip to the Mediterraneanâ s smallest island nation even more enjoyable Hereâ s all you need to know before your trip to Malta Advertisement Walks around historic cities like Mdina are a highlight of any visit to Malta pack comfortable shoes Shutterstock Pack a good pair of walking shoes Malta is a great place to explore on two legs especially around Valletta and in the hilltop walled city of Mdina Note that both places involve plenty of steps and centuries old cobblestones and wearing a comfortable pair of walking shoes is recommended even essential If thereâ s a bit of rain lanes and plazas can also become slippery and are probably not best negotiated in a pair of sandals or flip flops Good walking shoes will also serve you well when exploring clifftop hiking routes like Maltaâ s Dingli Cliffs or the Xlendi Walk on Gozo An effective sun hat and sunglasses are also essential to combat the heat of a Mediterranean summer Gozo in particular is becoming a popular walking destination with marked trails linking villages clifftops and beaches See the Visit Gozo website for recommended trails Book well ahead for Maltaâ s most amazing sight A year old subterranean necropolis only rediscovered in Maltaâ s Ä al Saflieni Hypogeum is one of the countryâ s essential sights As such itâ s extremely popular â and to protect the fragile centuries old interior entry is limited to people per day Booking ahead online â far ahead ideally as long as three months before arriving in Malta â is highly recommended Also if you miss your timed entry itâ s not possible to join the next guided tour Last minute entry tickets which also sell out quickly are available the day prior for an additional charge of â Book a food tour soon after you arrive in Malta to get the most out of the countryâ s fascinating cuisine Matthew Mirabelli for Lonely Planet Hit the ground running when exploring Maltaâ s fascinating food scene As an island country in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea Malta has a cuisine thatâ s been influenced by various cultures throughout the centuries French British Italian â especially Sicilian â and Arabic flavors all overlap in the diverse food traditions here Before leaving home book a private walking tour with Offbeat Malta Food Trails for early in your trip That way youâ ll be up to speed and armed with cultural and historical culinary insights as you explore local restaurants island vineyards and food markets across Malta and its smaller sister island of Gozo Itâ s also worth booking well ahead for popular Michelin starred restaurants like Vallettaâ s Noni especially during Maltaâ s busiest travel months July and August Held in early August near Valletta the annual Malta International Food Festival is an essential event for traveling foodies Around one month earlier in July Gozoâ s version of the same festival enlivens the traditional village of Xewkija Sign up for an International Driving Permit Malta is an excellent destination to explore independently in a rental car especially on the quieter roads of Gozo Car rental prices are some of the lowest in Europe and having your own ride offers more convenience and efficiency than relying on Maltaâ s extensive but sometimes slow bus service As in the UK and most Commonwealth countries drivers need to stick to the left hand side of the road Booking ahead for rental cars is recommended for visits in July and August Advertisement Travelers from the UK and European Union countries can use their home driving licenses â but if youâ re coming from a non EU country youâ ll also need an International Driving Permit IDP These are issued for a one year period by local automobile associations in travelersâ home countries Bring your driving A game Especially when driving around Maltaâ s main urban conurbation incorporating Valletta Sliema and St Julianâ s itâ s worth channeling a confident approach to getting behind the wheel The roads are usually very busy and local drivers can regard indicators for signaling a turn as optional Yielding giving way at roundabouts is also routinely ignored If you remember to drive with confidence plus an added level of awareness youâ ll be fine Many Maltese roads especially through villages can be narrow so be patient and courteous to oncoming traffic if you need to yield give way As a pedestrian also never assume that local drivers will stop for you at pedestrian crossings Outside of Maltaâ s most built up areas driving is much less stressful and having a car makes getting around Gozo and to Maltaâ s more remote beaches and destinations much easier Be sure to bring confidence and awareness when you get behind the wheel in Malta Lukas Bischoff Shutterstock Practice in car safety Malta has a low rate of violent crime though there are occasional reports of rental cars being broken into at beach car parks especially if theyâ re adjacent to a more remote stretch of sand Take care to always lock your car and never leave anything of value inside Also be aware of your belongings when swimming and sunbathing on all beaches as occasional opportunistic thefts do occur A few words of Maltese will get you far Everyone speaks English in Malta but itâ s still worth learning a few key phrases in the countryâ s national language also known as Malti Most closely related to the Arabic dialects of western North Africa Maltese is Europeâ s only Semitic language a grouping that also includes Arabic Hebrew and Amharic as well as a language with a few loan words easily traced to their country of provenance Here are a few key Malti words to assist you during a trip merÄ ba hello bonju good morning bonswa good evening grazzi thank you Remember that Malta is a largely conservative country With a strong Roman Catholic heritage Maltese society remains largely conservative Dress respectfully when entering a church â having a shawl to cover shoulders is a good idea â and hats and sunglasses should be removed Away from the beach cover up with a sarong and t shirt and note that topless and nude sunbathing is illegal When meeting someone for the first time a handshake is appropriate Expect a high level of health care High standard health and dental care is readily available and Maltese pharmacists can give advice and sell a wide range of over the counter medications Holders of a European Health Insurance Card EHIC â available to citizens of the EU and Iceland Liechtenstein Norway and Switzerland â receive free or reduced cost health care while in Malta and the country has reciprocal health care agreements with Australia and the UK Visitors from other countries should definitely have travel insurance Take your cues from locals about where and when to enter the water at Maltaâ s countless swimming spots Jaroslav Moravcik Shutterstock Look to the locals for safe swimming The Maltese have a well known phrase â Il baÄ ar ratba u rasu iebsa â meaning â The sea has a soft belly but a hard head â While beaches are largely safe in calm weather storms windy weather and strong undercurrents can present danger and locals advise never to swim in rough seas Major beaches operate a flag system and have lifeguards on patrol from June to September If thereâ s no flag system operating or if youâ re in doubt ask a local about whether and where itâ s safe to swim When diving into popular swimming locations such as St Peterâ s Pool and Il Kalanka in southern Malta take extra care Be vigilant in nightlife areas Fueled by alcohol fights and drunken violence have been known to occur in nightlife zones especially around the late night clubs of the Paceville area of Valletta Keep your wits about you even or especially after a cocktail or two Malta and COVID No documentation showing either a vaccination certificate or a negative PCR test is required to enter Malta As of mid August the country was experiencing its highest number of COVID cases in the prior months As public buses can be very crowded especially around rush hour wearing a mask is a sensible and prudent way to minimize spread and potential infection Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere
