trip in Croatia Lucie Grace Apr min read Share The Paklinski Islands off the coast of Hvar Croatia Ajan Alen Shutterstock When I moved to Croatia I was aware of the length of the country and its sprawling coastline But the number of islands and islets here That came as a surprise I would never have guessed the answer was â more than â So after arriving I decided to leave my suitcases at my friendâ s hostel in the leafy laid back capital of Zagreb and trundled off with just a backpack to see as many of the inhabited islands as I could I started with the Dalmatian Coast keen to visit the most famous destinations and catch a glimpse of the dazzling Renaissance churches and baroque town halls Advertisement I donâ t drive a car â but since bus train and ferry links in Croatia are cheap and efficient you donâ t need to get behind the wheel to get offshore And no matter how long the journey takes once you dip your toes in the clear waters of the Adriatic youâ ll forget all about the bus that brought you there The ultimate island hopping trip does take a bit of planning though â not only to home in on your must see destinations but also to research ferry schedules off season closures and local festivals My best advice Accept that youâ ll barely scratch the surface repress that FOMO and aim for the spots that appeal most Fewer is more in the island game Luckily weâ re here to demystify the process with some helpful tips and practical pointers as you plan the ideal Croatian island trip just for you The harbor at Vis Croatia Getty Images iStockphoto How many islands should I visit First things first ask yourself if youâ re committed to multiple jumps between islands If not you can always do as the locals do and spend your vacation happily grazing and lazing on just one Rustic Å olta olive groveâ dotted Ugljan or the rugged shores of Vis are great picks all three are idyllic yet easily accessible from mainland city ports Definitely keen to visit a few Decide between doing a loop of the Dalmatian islands in the south or exploring the equally charming archipelago in the Kvarner Gulf to the north The classic Dalmatian coast route will take you on ferries starting in Split and link BraÄ Hvar KorÄ ula and Mljet before ending in Dubrovnik or the other way around starting in Dubrovnik and ending in Split This itinerary includes popular islands like Hvar as well as two of the countryâ s top cities for travelers Advertisement The Kvarner islands are ever so slightly less trodden and include Krk Cres LoÅ inj Pag and Rab in the bay between the vibrant maritime cities of Rijeka and Zadar This cluster is just as wonderful as the Dalmatian islands if marginally less popular due to their lack of Game of Thrones cachet or hype depending on your point of view Regardless all of Croatiaâ s islands have buckets of charm with different traditions foods and scenery A ferry off the coast of Croatia Frequent services connect the countryâ s hundreds of islands Brian Logan Photography Shutterstock When is the best time to go island hopping in Croatia Give careful thought about just when you want to go to Croatia when it comes to visiting the islands youâ ll have to also work around ferry schedules Spring and autumn are the perfect seasons to immerse yourself in local culture and gastronomy and the climate is pleasant and ideal for sightseeing cyclists and hikers enjoy the fresh temperatures of these seasons too They just require some extra organization as youâ ll need to work around irregularly scheduled ferry service The two main ferry companies â Krilo and state owned Jadrolinija â start ramping up their daily services come May and June adding ever more service throughout the glorious summer months Yet August is best dodged Croatians subscribe to the tradition of closing the office for the month of August to relax on you guessed it an Adriatic island This makes accommodations both scarce and pricey and adds traffic to otherwise quiet beach roads Aside from August summer is ideal for beach lovers the konoba restaurants and guest houses are open and thereâ s a swathe of festivals that will enliven your itinerary A few top local shindigs to have on your radar the Easter weekend procession Za â Following the Crossâ on Hvar the KorÄ ula Sword Dance Festival performed from June to September EDM fun at Hideout Festival on Pag in July and the BraÄ Film Festival in August Finally if youâ re a committed off peak traveler itâ s not impossible to cruise to a few islands in the winter as skeleton ferry services do run to keep the islands connected Just keep in mind that the winds are fierce and many businesses close during the off season I wouldnâ t recommend visiting during this time unless you have a novel to write Zlatni Rat on BraÄ is one of Croatiaâ s most memorable beaches DeFodi Images Getty Images Which islands should I visit based on my interests Now that youâ ve pinpointed your region and time of year to visit itâ s time to pick the islands that provide the sort of experience you want from your holiday Do you fancy wild unspoiled beaches Head to Cres Pedaling through UNESCO listed farmland Itâ s Hvar youâ re after Wine tasting at rolling vineyards Donâ t miss KorÄ ula Dancing all night long Pag is for you And then thereâ s the most scenic beach in the country the famous peninsula of Zlatni Rat on BraÄ I also rate Krk very highly as I love to visit abandoned buildings the seaside town of Malinska is home to the Haludovo Palace Hotel a dilapidated modernist masterpiece since youâ ll have to enter at your own risk you didnâ t hear that from me Once youâ ve worked out whether youâ re after rest and relaxation or all the food and culture you can get your hands on decide how many days to spend on each island The ferries may dictate the length of your sojourn depending on the month you go either way donâ t rush it I definitely advise two nights minimum per stop â ideally three to really ease into the pace of island life No one wants to end a vacation more exhausted than they started it Beachgoers in Hvar We recommend reserving accommodations and transport in advance especially in peak summer MariaMaslova Shutterstock Do I need to book accommodation and transport in advance Finally itâ s time to get booking Iâ d start the accommodation research a few months before you go to have your pick of the best places Itâ s also smart to book your bus tickets a few weeks prior Local carrier Arriva Croatia offers bus service on the islands with seats bookable up to days in advance you save by buying as soon as they go on sale with fares cheaper on the phone app than the website download it in advance Iâ d also advise booking ferry spots ahead of your trip Youâ ll be fine booking the main routes a day or two before you set sail â but best not to chance it if youâ re traveling outside the summer months when service is less frequent If youâ re taking the scenic railroad from Zagreb to Split or vice versa thatâ s worth pre booking too as itâ s a small train and it fills up fast The village of Lubenice on Cres island Croatia Jan Hendrik Shutterstock Top tips for a Croatian island trip My next visit to a Croatian island or two or will certainly be less rushed and Iâ ll plan to stay on each island for longer One night on sleepy Cres is not enough Iâ m still reminiscing over the smell of cypress trees and the light dancing on crystal blue bays I wonâ t be staying bang in the center of Hvar Town again though itâ s the clubbing center of the Dalmatian islands so not for you unless you want to party all night If you do then donâ t miss it Pack your own food if youâ re vegan dietary requirements are catered to in big Croatian cities but less so on the islands And of course driving is much easier than relying on buses Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Croatia Let a local expert craft your dream trip
