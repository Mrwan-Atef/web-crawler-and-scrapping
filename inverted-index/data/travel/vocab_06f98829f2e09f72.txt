The unlikely rebirth of London s legendary St Pancras Station St Pancras station anchors a revitalizing area in north London In recent years the station has undergone its own transformation Photograph by Georg Knoll Laif Redux TRAVEL The unlikely rebirth of a London legend A Victorian train station saved by a poet is the jewel in the crown of this urban renewal By Nicola Trup February min read With its red brick exterior and soaring clock tower London s St Pancras International train station is hard to miss The Victorian Gothic structure is widely considered an architectural masterpiece But a hundred years after it was built British Railways wanted to tear it all down and repurpose the land Then a poet with a love of Victorian architecture stepped in Sir John Betjeman who later became one of the United Kingdom s most popular poets laureate successfully led a campaign to save St Pancras planting the seed for a world class train station that would form the beating heart of a flourishing neighborhood Today on the station s mezzanine away from the hordes of travelers waiting for trains to Loughborough and Luton or Eurostar trains to Paris and Amsterdam stands a statue of Betjeman holding his hat and gazing up at the spectacular vaulted ceiling Around his feet are inscribed the words Who saved this glorious station Love London Check out this ultimate guide to England s capital city From coal to conservation Betjeman s spirit lives on in this part of postcode where all around a blur of construction is transforming this hub of transportation into a destination itself In the area between St Pancras and King s Cross stations industrial elements shape shift into cafes shops and luxury apartments Across Regent s Canal in Granary Square converted grain stores opened their doors as restaurants and bars in Once the site of a coal transport stop Coal Drops Yard is now the place to go in King s Cross for vintage records and expertly brewed coffee Photograph by James Veysey Camera Press Redux More recently neighboring Coal Drops Yard began its own new chapter in The collection of old warehouses and viaducts takes its name from their original design and purpose an elevated railway for unloading hoppers of coal which by the was obsolete Instead the buildings were serving as the site for illegal raves before they later morphed into landmark nightclubs The Cross The Key and Bagley s later Canvas With the sunshine glinting above them the curved roofs of Coal Drops Yard s twin buildings now resemble a pair of wings an organic shape amid a sea of industrial angles Underneath is a mix of designer chains and upmarket restaurants with some smaller brands too In a carriage house like space along the side of one of the buildings punctuated by potted plants and a mishmash of furniture coffee lovers order flat whites at Redemption Roasters The beans here are roasted at HM Prison Aylesbury where inmates are also trained to be baristas Just north of King s Cross and St Pancras stations sleek modern office buildings and luxury apartments look out at Regent s Canal Photograph by Sarah Lee Eyevine Redux Nearby the sound of soul music drifts out of Honest Jon s an offshoot of the legendary record shop that s stood in the same Portobello Road location for years Along the canal towpath a trio of Victorian era gas storage tanks has been repurposed as luxury apartments their florid cast iron frames encircling the cylindrical edifices within On the southern banks of the canal lies Camley Street Natural Park two acres of woodland meadows and wetland It too was once a coal drop reclaimed by nature when it fell out of use overgrown it became a haven for wildlife Learn how London is pledging to be greener healthier and wilder When there was talk of the site being redeveloped the London Wildlife Trust successfully campaigned to turn it into a nature reserve a green oasis in the middle of a concrete jungle as manager Karolina Leszczynska Gogol puts it The park reopens in spring with a new visitor and learning center Red light legends reinvented For all the smart new bars and restaurants there are still a few proper old school pubs such as The Scottish Stores whose overtly contemporary signage does it a disservice Inside you ll find the Platonic ideal of a pub There s wood paneling and William Morris wallpaper real ale and jars of nuts You see those They re original says Gerard Oliver a cheery South African who s managed the pub since He s pointing to a series of cartoon like drawings of huntsmen and beagles inset into the wood and preserved behind glass Before the current owners took over the pub these illustrations were lost behind layers of grime and cheap paint The reconstructed interior of King s Cross station in London highlights a latticed diagrid ceiling similar to the one that graces the British Museum s Great Court Photograph by Doug Armand Getty Images The Scottish Stores was originally an inn offering rooms to traders many of them Scots who d come to King s Cross by train but it gained a reputation as a rather insalubrious hangout for sex workers and criminals and was notorious for bar brawls In the at the height of the neighborhood s red light infamy it became a strip bar It was grimy and dark the windows were blacked out and the wood was nicotine stained Oliver tells me I came in once back then and I remember thinking this place has so much potential Eventually the pub s current owners spotted that potential too restoring and reopening the place in Characterizing the area s recent history as a phoenix like rise from squalor to respectability doesn t tell the whole story Alongside the prostitution drug abuse and illicit nightlife the post industrial enclave provided workspaces for artists It was pretty ropey but of course studio space was cheap says visual artist Michael Pinsky who s lived and worked in the area since The Cubitt studio complex before it moved to nearby Angel had a community that included Turner Prize winners It really was quite high level he says Pinsky s view of those days however certainly isn t rose tinted I prefer it the way it is now he says The King s Cross development is quite upmarket but that being said the area where I live between Caledonian Road and York Way is still quite run down given how central it is It s not completely turned around yet
