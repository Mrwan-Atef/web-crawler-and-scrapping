Photograph by Francesco Riccardo Iacomino Getty Images By Sean Newsom March This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Tempted by the idea of hiking holidays but worry they ll be too gruelling Here are eight beginner friendly hikes that are less about endurance and more about the simple pleasures of the Great Outdoors Some will take you just a few hours others last several days But regardless of which you choose to tackle each has been chosen for their combination of easy terrain well maintained paths and spectacular surroundings Just be sure you re properly shod before you start A pair of well fitted walking boots appropriate for your hike and chosen with the help of an experienced shop assistant will save you a world of pain once you get going Essential day hiking gear from trail clothing to clever backpacks Tre Cime di Lavaredo Italy Length miles Time hours In the mountains hikers have a simple rule of thumb the best views come on the biggest walks Unless that is you re walking the Tre Cime di Lavaredo circuit in the Italian Dolomites It girdles three of the most gobsmacking walls of shattered rock you ll ever clap eyes on and yet the path is broad and steady throughout with each ascent carefully paced It begins and ends at a series of car parks by the Rifugio Auronzo access is controlled and there s a fee to pay as well and from there you can walk either way It s also served by bus from Auronzo Hike it in June or September to avoid the high summer crowds and bring a pair of telescopic hiking poles if you re tackling it in June in case there s still snow on the path You don t want to slip as you stare slack jawed at the extraordinary scenery When the right weather conditions prevail the route to Riomaggiore can be a scenic trip with heavenly views Photograph by Carlo Alberto Conti Getty Images Sentiero Azzurro Italy Length miles Time days Most hikers could complete the whole coast hugging length of the Sentiero Azzurro from Monterosso to Riomaggiore in one short but intense day of walking But why would you want to chew through such a magnificent route in a few hours Linking the five villages of Liguria s famous Cinque Terre this narrow path is a route to savour getting the walking done early in the day to avoid any crowds then taking your time over lunch boat trips and sea swims during the rest of the day July and August are best avoided on account of both the heat and the overtourism But that s no bother because the weather is already balmy in April and can stay warm till October On a sunny day the sense of height and space is so intense you ll think you re peering over the edge of a cloud Bring walking poles if you re at all unsteady on your feet check beforehand if your chosen sections of path are open landslides can close them and don t forget to buy a path permit You can catch a train from any the five villages when you re done The Chemin de Puy France Length miles Time days Don t worry we re not suggesting you hike the full miles of this pilgrim s trail which links the French town of Puy en Velay with the Camino de Santiago in Spain We ve cherry picked a short section through rural Gascony starting in Éauze where the land is rich and green the gentle hills easily tackled and the food and wine always tempting You do however need to walk it the wrong way against the flow of hikers so that your final goal is the loveliest town on the route For three miles before you reach it hilltop Lectoure beckons you along leafy lanes and between rolling wheat fields Once there expect to be greeted by an ensemble of cafes boulangeries and medieval walls The other stops Montréal du Gers Condom La Romieu are all ancient and lovely too and because the route is covered by France s long distance footpath it s served by excellent online mapping Agen is the key railway station linked by bus or taxi to both Éauze and Lectoure Walking along Hadrian s Wall is a treat for history buffs passing ancient ruins and archeological sites Photograph by Roy James Shakespeare Getty Images Hadrian s Wall England Length miles Time days For hikers with a penchant for history the central section of Hadrian s Wall from Birdoswald to Chollerford is a long and continuous treat packed with evocative ruins mind expanding archaeology and an ever present sense of communion with the people who garrisoned the frontier It is also by upland standards easy going The long distance trail that follows the wall is well maintained and is shadowed by a lower flatter route when the ridge line dips and rolls too steeply Peppered with B Bs the path offers plenty of places to break the journey while the and bus services connect you to railway stations on the Carlisle to Newcastle line Just remember to keep each day s walking short That way you ll have time to explore key sites and museums as well as diverting south to the fort at Vindolanda Britain s richest trove of Roman remains it s still producing extraordinary evidence after nearly years of excavations Stockholm Archipelago Trail Sweden Length miles Time days All told this extraordinary island hopping trail covers miles across islands in the Stockholm Archipelago But thanks to excellent ferry services it s easy to pick out a section or two from the list and add an outdoorsy extension to a Stockholm city break The island of Grinda is the obvious choice About minutes from the city s quay at Strömkajen it s far enough out to deter most day trippers but also home to the Wärdshuset a pretty guesthouse and restaurant for anyone who needs a longer escape So if you book far enough in advance you ll enjoy understated Scandi style comfort after your walk Come in June or July avoid the weekends and bring your bathers The footpath around the island serves up forested bluffs smooth half submerged boulders and sheltered little bays perfect for swimming Boats putter seabirds swoop and you ll wish you could stay a whole week Heidschnuckenweg Germany Length miles Time days Voted Germany s most beautiful hike in this Trail of the Heath Sheep is also one of its easiest For miles it explores the long north south strip of the Lüneburg and Southern Heaths with no hill higher than and the path broad and sandy for most of its length Hike it in mid to late August when the heather blooms and turns the landscape into a sea of lilac but don t feel obliged to go the full distance The three day stretch provided by stages to from Handeloh to Bispingen offers a lovely taster with rail access at either end and some serene villages en route for overnight stops None however are quite as soothing as car free Wilsede You ll probably stop for lunch here on day two and for a brief and blissful moment it ll seem like you ve hiked out of the century altogether Heischnuckenweg is known as one of Germany s most scenic hikes Photograph by Markus Gebauer Getty Images Lechweg Austria Length miles Times days How do you have a multi day hiking holiday in the Alps that doesn t strain every sinew Simple you follow a river downstream And not just any river This mile trail follows the Lech one of the wildest watercourses in central Europe which floods with snowmelt every spring and has carved out a landscape of gravel banks and floodplains that look more Canadian than Austrian On your hike two magnificent walls of mountain will be your companions as you descend the valley through forests meadows and over dramatic suspension bridges A combination of train and bus will get you from Zurich or Innsbruck airports to the mountain town of Lech while Reutte s railway station is a good place to catch a train to Munich for the journey home Hallin Fell England Length one mile Time one hour For a family friendly hike try Hallin Fell Set halfway along Ullswater in the Lake District National Park it s all but a mound compared with Helvellyn s glowering massif nearby You can drive a third of the way up it too but that just adds to the sense of drama It begins with the switchback road up to the car park continues with a short but breathtakingly steep ascent through vertical feet and finishes with a dizzy degree view of open water round topped fells and busy Cumbrian skies And even with the obligatory snack stops you ll all be at the top in half an hour The smooth grassy path means it can be tackled in wellies or grippy trainers too For those without a car the Ullswater Steamer service from Pooley Bridge to Howtown offers even more exciting access though it does double the length of the walk To
