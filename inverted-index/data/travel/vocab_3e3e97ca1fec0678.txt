State ferries is half of the fun There are a few classic inns and B Bs in the historic towns of Langley and Coupeville if you want to spend the night It s definitely worth planning your trip around

restaurant La Boucherie is at the top of the locavore pack Bainbridge Whidbey and the San Juans also have a myriad of small farms and charming restaurants worth a visit Seafood of course is a big draw Local crab salmon and shellfish should be on your not to miss list including the word renowned Penn Cove Mussels from Whidbey Island Whidbey Island has the most spectacular natural attractions but it requires the biggest time commitment to get to it s miles northwest of Seattle Bainbridge is the most developed island it s something of a moneyed bedroom community with higher end restaurants and shops supplementing its natural attractions It s also the easiest to get to just hop on a ferry from Pier on the Downtown Seattle waterfront Vashon is the most pastoral of the islands if you don t like leisurely strolls beachcombing or bike rides you might get bored there quickly Bainbridge and Whidbey get tons of visitors in summer Though you ll be able to snag a walk on spot on the ferry spaces for cars can fill up so arrive early Whidbey is big so you ll most likely want to tour by car you can actually drive there too as the north end of the island is accessible via Deception Pass and a car is handy on Bainbridge as well especially if you want to tour the entire island or visit spectacular Bloedel Reserve Otherwise Bainbridge is your best bet if you want to walk on the ferry and tour by foot Sights Listings Restaurants Listings Hotels Listings Shopping Listings Guidebooks for Every Journey Fodor s Pacific Northwest Portland Seattle Vancouver the Best of Oregon and
