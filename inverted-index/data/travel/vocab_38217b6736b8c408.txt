best road trips plus tips on scooter hire and more Theodora Sutcliffe Oct min read Share By two wheels or four these road trips will take you around the best of Bali Â molchanovdmitry Getty Images iStockphoto Driving in Bali is not for the faint hearted but it does offer rewards You can get off the beaten track and away from the crowds that besiege the southern highways savoring soaring views over mountains and rice terraces and pausing at simple roadside eateries for signature Indonesian meals of ikan bakar grilled fish and babi guling suckling pig Whether you choose to drive yourself or hire a car and driver â a safe and increasingly popular option â a road trip in Bali will give you a sense of the islandâ s dramatic geography and rich culture thatâ s hard to come by from the back seat of a tour bus let alone from Bali s frustratingly limited public transport system To get the best from this beautiful island here are five highly recommended routes for a Bali road trip Ubud Waterfalls Route Best road trip for photographing rice terraces and waterfalls Advertisement Start and end â Ubud miles one day Famed for its temples and crafts Ubud in the age of Instagram is gaining attention for its many scenic waterfalls including towering Tegenungan and canyon framed Tukad Cepung which looks amazing when photographed illuminated by rays of sunlight This satisfying one day loop strings together rice field vistas and three of the most popular falls plus the Ceking rice terraces in Tegalalang and the beautiful Gunung Kawi Sebatu water temple a less visited alternative to the more famous but less spectacular Tirta Empul sacred springs Local tip Set out early in the morning so you have time for photo stops at the Tegenungan Tibumana and Tukad Cepung falls before veering north to Gunung Kawi Sebatu and south through the rice terrace landscapes around Tegalalang then circling back to base Pop into the historic water palace in Tirta Gangga on the East Bali Loop Â Elizaveta Galitckaia Shutterstock East Bali Loop Best road trip for hiking and snorkeling Start and end â Candidasa or Padangbai miles two or more days East Bali offers some of the islandâ s most dramatic landscapes as well as slender but satisfying beaches where you can evade the crowds Experience all of this on a leisurely multi day loop that can take anything from two days to as long as you like Start either from the sweet little port town of Padangbai or the more developed tourist enclave of Candidasa and set out early to beat the crowds to Pura Lempuyang a gorgeous complex of seven temples on the slopes of Mount Lempuyang Rather than simply standing in line to photograph the Gates of Heaven â a Balinese open gateway that frames perfect views of the Agung volcano â itâ s worth hiking all the way up to the top temple to enjoy the architecture atmosphere and vistas Next detour southwest via the historic water palace in scenic Tirta Gangga enjoying lunch with a rice field view then take the winding mountain road to the strip of fishing villages at Amed and spend at least one night by the shore Be sure to dive or snorkel the USAT Liberty wreck a hollowed out World War II transport ship that now throngs with marine life such as sweetlips trevally bumphead parrot fish crustaceans and sea turtles Close the loop by following the pretty eastbound coastal road stopping at the Taman Ujung water palace and other regal relics around Amlapura Around the Island Best road trip for Bali s famous beaches Advertisement Start and end â Sanur miles three days Driving right around Bali is a time consuming endeavor With the main west coast road a major inter island trucking route and the main east coast route from Sanur to Padangbai one of the islandâ s few fast highways it can also be both dangerous and stressful But there are rewards for those who make the effort If you re committed to the trip start from the beach town of Sanur head northeast and then trace the north coast go down the west coast and circle around the Bukit Peninsula to get back to your starting point allowing at least three days En route you can drop in on many of the island s most famous â and busiest â surf beaches and shore temples including Kuta Beach and Pura Tanah Lot Local tip Traffic is generally slow and journeys generally take much longer than Google Maps indicates As you drive around the island take full advantage of the surf on Bali s beaches Â Wonderful Nature Shutterstock South to North across Bali Best road trip for Bali first timers Ubudâ Singaraja miles two days Driving across Bali from south to north is much easier than driving around Bali Volcanoes crater lakes rice fields temples and waterfalls offer ample rewards for landscape lovers and photographers Start from Ubud or farther south if thatâ s where youâ re based and follow the main cross island route northwards towards Singaraja Stop in Bedugul for the world class botanical gardens and the lakefront Pura Ulun Danu Bratan temple Continue north via the towering Gitgit Waterfalls â waterfall addicts will want to hit the Sekumpul Falls as well â to Singaraja After an afternoon exploring Singaraja return the way you came the next morning Detour If you want to extend your trip head west along the attractive coast road to Taman Nasional Bali Barat West Bali National Park or Pemuteran Beach Nusa Penida Overnight Best road trip for exploring caves Start and end â Ped Nusa Penida miles two days Nusa Penida â s narrow cliffside roads offer some of Baliâ s most scenic driving and itâ s worth spending a few days exploring this appealing island off Bali s southeast coast Spend one day investigating the southern and eastern sides of the island stopping at the dramatic cave temple Goa Giri Putri beautiful Diamond Beach and Atuh Beach The next day explore the more traveled northwest of Nusa Penida snorkeling at Crystal Bay photographing vertiginous Kelingking Beach admiring the collapsed sea cave known as Broken Beach and swimming in the natural infinity pool known as Angelâ s Billabong Local tip Wrap up with a sunset drink at the Amok Sunset bar on the northwest shore Bring a mask and snorkel there are plenty of places to dive in around Nusa Penida Â Artush Shutterstock Tips for driving in Bali Driving in Bali can be challenging Expect to find yourself sharing the road with anything from dogs and chickens to kaki lima street vendor food carts not to mention over tired truckers surging throngs of scooters and tourists who are as unfamiliar with local road etiquette as they are with the controls of their motorbikes Road conditions vary widely but even what passes for major roads may feature uneven surfaces and potholes marked if youâ re lucky by a plastic bag waving from the end of a stick Driving in Bali is officially on the left although you ll see some creative approaches at junctions Itâ s not uncommon for motorbikes to head the wrong way down the inside of a highway rather than attempt to turn across the traffic Smaller vehicles are expected to move to make way for larger vehicles on the often narrow roads never try to hold your position on the road against an oncoming truck As a general rule driving in Bali is about managing whatâ s in front of you rather than worrying about whatâ s behind If driving without the correct papers you will be expected to pay at the very least a cash bribe if stopped Foreigners are vulnerable to exploitation after even a minor traffic accident so drive cautiously and stick to the rules even if locals don t seem to Make sure you re properly insured if you re planning to hire a scooter in Bali Â Stephane Victor Lonely Planet Should I rent a scooter Rather than renting a car many travelers follow locals lead and rent a scooter which costs around per day Before considering this keep in mind that your travel insurance will only cover you to drive if you have a valid motorbike license from your home country along with a valid international license or an Indonesian driverâ s license Though it s widely flouted by law both drivers and passengers must wear a helmet Bali really isnâ t the place to learn to ride a scooter â if you donâ t already have a license consider renting a small car instead Renting a car in Bali A small entry level rental car with all damage covered at your own expense can cost as little as daily However renting from an international rental company with full insurance coverage â which is advisable â will cost considerably more Renting a car with a driver can often work out cheaper than self hire costing around per day This will give you all the freedom of a Bali road trip without having to take the risk of driving yourself Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
