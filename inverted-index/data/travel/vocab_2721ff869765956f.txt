Rica Megadiverse Costa Rica has long impressed adventure travellers with its lush rainforests and outstanding wildlife but the country s Monteverde region is increasingly becoming a top destination for families too Families are being drawn to Costa Rica and especially to the Monteverde region with its abundance of family friendly sights and activities Photograph by Kevin Wells Getty Images By Steph Dyson August Think of Costa Rica and the images that first come to mind are of untouched rainforests teeming with wildlife and dotted with waterfalls cascading into clear blue pools It s the first tropical country on the planet that has actively reversed deforestation and now protects a quarter of its territory one of the largest proportions in the world Hidden away in the Tilarán Range in the country s northwestern interior misty Monteverde is a canton with serious environmental credentials Nearly half of Costa Rica s biodiversity is found within its surrounding virgin cloud forest which is protected by several reserves Monteverde s main attraction is its wildlife ranging from the red eyed tree frog to the country s huge variety of colourful birds Travellers of all ages will be equally awed by treetop bridges and nighttime walks which make for a magical introduction to the region s unique ecosystem the cloud forest Here s how to plan an adventure fuelled family trip Keep an eye out for Costa Rica s vibrant red eyed tree frog Agalychnis callidryas found in Monteverde s humid rainforests Photograph by Getty Images What to do The Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve is the nature reserve that put the area on the map Arrange your ticket in advance as only visitors per day can explore the reserve s paths which weave between evergreen trees slung with bromeliads and strangler figs The trails are quieter however at the Santa Elena Cloud Forest Reserve further north Keep your eyes peeled for white faced capuchin monkeys perched up in the canopy and groups of coatis raccoon like animals also known as coatimundis trundling along the paths What s more on clear days you can spot the huge conical Arenal Volcano looming in the distance Next experience the rainforest from a perspective normally reserved for birds and monkeys at the acre Selvatura Adventure Park Eight hanging bridges are suspended within the forest s mist veiled canopy and form part of a mile trail that is suitable for all ages Families can join a guided tour of the forest for the chance to learn more about it from a biological and ornithological perspective Dusk falls early so even the youngest travellers will be awake for a guided night walk through the Children s Eternal Rainforest reserve The family friendly trails turn into a buzzing metropolis of creatures you re unlikely to see in the day if you re lucky you might spot golden orb spiders pit vipers and even slumbering toucans The Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve offers visitors more than miles of well maintained trails to explore the cloud forest Photograph by Simon Dannhauer Getty Images Where to eat For a relaxed brunch stop for a coffee freshly made pancakes or a typical Central American dish of huevos rancheros eggs with chillies tomatoes and peppers in burritos at the excellent Stella s Cafe a low key cafe surrounded by greenery and darting hummingbirds If you need a sweet treat after an active day book a tour at Don

iridescent plumage of shimmering green and red half metre long tails and a feathery mohawk the quetzal s are simple to identify but surprisingly challenging to find Fortunately Monteverde ranks as one
