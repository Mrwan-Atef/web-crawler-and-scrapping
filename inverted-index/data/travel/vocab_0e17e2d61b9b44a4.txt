A guide to Valletta Malta TRAVEL A guide to Valletta the Maltese capital with an eye for art and entertainment In Malta s harbour framed capital a rich and evolving art scene unfolds among honeyed baroque facades echoing the global influences that have shaped the city over the centuries Valletta Malta s capital bursts with art and history that echoes centuries of influences Photograph by Francesco Lastrucci By Alicia Miller June This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK It s an extension of God a celebration of his beauty and perfection Father Charles remarks as we stand at the threshold of St John s Co Cathedral in central Valletta necks craned towards the ceiling Armies of painted angels swirl overhead elaborate carvings festoon archways lining the nave and painstakingly detailed marble inlay covers the floor But all this splendour pales in comparison to the gold thick gleaming coats of which adorn nearly every surface in dazzling maximalist fashion This cathedral was built by the knights for the knights Father Charles continues a smile spreading across his white bearded face And as you can see the knights were very wealthy It s impossible to speak about St John s Co Cathedral or about the Maltese capital Valletta at all without speaking about the Knights of St John This religious and military order founded in Jerusalem in the medieval ages was charged with the defence of the Holy Land under papal charter With support from Pope Clement VII the exclusive collective consisting solely of wealthy men from elite noble families made Malta its new headquarters in the century It would go on to rule here for more than years building countless artistic wonders including the entire fortified city of Valletta and its crowning glory this cathedral The knights came from noble families all across Europe and you can see each of their nations represented in different chapels along the nave Father Charles says as we begin to walk the glinting interior As the cathedral s in house conservator he knows each piece of artwork inside out and has restored many of them himself As we move he shares stories of the paintings their artists and the trials of upkeep I needed to reline the frame on this Mattia Preti painting it took me a year Valletta s baroque old town is filled with handsome honey hued streets Photograph by Francesco Lastrucci In the comparatively austere French chapel he points out the restrained Nazarene style fleur de lis motif and in the Aragon elaborate metallic sculptures It quickly becomes clear that St John s Co Cathedral is not just a church but a showcase of some of the finest and century European art and architecture a bit like a living Louvre or Rijksmuseum Look at this wood it doesn t come from Malta we don t have big trees like this Father Charles enthuses over a ceiling beam before adding The knights brought in all the best artists of the time and all the best materials too Stepping back out into the daylight after my ecclesiastical art history lesson winged angels and silver plated liturgical paraphernalia still spiralling through my mind I find I have a new found appreciation for Valletta s baroque downtown Handsome honeyed facades are lined in ornate stonework subtle cream townhouses sport painted wooden gallarija closed balconies and narrow cobbled streets run downhill towards the expansive Grand Harbour its waters criss crossed with yachts and colourful luzzu fishing boats As I wander through the compact grid of streets a UNESCO World Heritage Site I pass restaurants gift shops and pods of tourists as well as locals lucky enough to live among this aesthetic wealth year round couples walking fluffy Maltese dogs and collared priests scooting around corners into tiny churches The old city headquarters of the knights may be extraordinarily pretty but they re also brimming with life How to spend a day in Valetta Malta s baroque harbourside city It wasn t always like this of course When the knights began to build their capital in atop a raised peninsula on Malta s east coast the land flanked by that rambling natural harbour was almost barren Or so it seemed Long before the knights arrived however the area had been pockmarked with the imprints of much more ancient peoples That s what I learn at the National Museum of Archaeology where I head that afternoon less than a block away from the cathedral Simple displays in glass cabinets belie the irreplaceable treasures within artefacts recovered from Malta s numerous neolithic sites Scattered across the island some spots are thought to date to BCE older than the Egyptian pyramids or Stonehenge Over millennia travellers from across the Mediterranean came to this sun soaked island to settle each civilisation leaving their mark before the next succeeded As I move from room to room in the museum I learn about the prehistoric Sicilians who ushered in elaborate megalithic structures between BCE and the Phoenicians smooth pottery precious gold amulets and purple dyed fabrics dating to around BCE The MUŻA National Museum of Art is only a short walk from the National Museum of Archaeology Photograph by Francesco Lastrucci I see rudimentary miniature sculptures and stone necklaces of imported greenstone and swirling stone carvings removed from the year old Tarxien Temples whose ruins lie four miles from the museum Most remarkable of all is one of the smallest exhibits a tiny clay figure entitled Sleeping Lady discovered in the subterranean galleries of the Hal Saflieni Hypogeum an ancient necropolis less than minutes drive from where I stand Lying on her side eyes peacefully closed she looks as if she s just slipped into her eternal slumber despite being carved millennia ago As museum visitors pause in the dimly lit exhibition space to admire her gentle serenity they can t help but hush as if not to wake her Timeless appeal Over my next few days in the city more of Valletta s artistic riches slowly reveal themselves The MUŻA National Museum of Art in a beautiful baroque building a short walk from the National Museum of Archaeology bursts with oil paintings mosaics and polished wooden marquetry tables In the historic Teatru Manoel one of the oldest working theatres in Europe a grand chandelier illuminates rows of gilded boxes Casa Rocca Piccola a year old noble family home cum museum showcases an extensive collection of visual treasures including elaborate gold filigree and Maltese lace There are historic knights related oddities too such as a chess set minus the queens designed specifically for the male only order As I enter a dining space laid with precious cutlery and ceramics I feel almost like I m in a residential version of St John s Co Cathedral unsure how to take in the sheer amount of artistic detail in front of me As I continue to explore I find that the city s aesthetic charm is not only hidden behind closed doors One evening at sunset I stand in the landscaped Upper Barrakka Gardens overlooking the harbour as toy sized boats zigzag through the waters far below and nature paints the sky pink and orange with its own masterful palette The Upper Barrakka Gardens overlook the harbour and is a popular sunset hangout Photograph by Francesco Lastrucci It would be easy to think of Valletta as being a kind of artistic timewarp an unchanging world of gilded wonder And yet its artistic evolution is not complete A new chapter begins later this year with the opening of MICAS the Malta International Contemporary Art Space in vast historic fortifications and ramparts just outside the city walls These works address our sense of space and time and how these can be distorted says British contemporary artist Conrad Shawcross the museum s first exhibitor as he leads me through a small portion of the site already open to visitors We wander along the bleached stone ramparts towards old military vaults ducking into the squeezed spaces to see his intricate light installation Slow Arc Within a Cube In the darkness metallic grid sculptures with moving bulb mechanisms throw metamorphosing shapes across the ceiling walls and floor appearing to change the dimensions of the space with every passing moment I made this piece years ago and it s been shown in various locations around the world but I m delighted it s found a permanent resting place here in Malta explains Conrad as we watch his light machines cast hypnotic illuminations One of MICAS s aims is to balance Malta s extensive history with exciting artistic innovation both local and global and this blend of fort architecture and modern craftwork seems the perfect embodiment It s a theme explored further in Conrad s large scale installation on the ramparts Beacons Blinking against the noon sun after our time in the dim vaults we gaze up at the series of huge colourful discs mounted flag like on poles Visible from far across the harbour they look like some kind of naval semaphoric code and in fact Conrad tells me they are Pointing to each oversized disc in turn he spells out their succinct meaning NOW On my final night in the city I return to St John s Co Cathedral The clusters of visitors have cleared out for the day leaving the vast interiors eerily quiet Showing my concert ticket to the guard I m ushered into a small oratory where I take a seat among an intimate audience Lights are dimmed a harp is played and a woman sings sweet baroque medleys by candlelight as we gaze up towards the altar which is adorned with what is arguably Valletta s most precious artistic treasure of all The Beheading of St John the Baptist an oil painting by century Italian artistic master Caravaggio stretches more than five metres wide a brutal and haunting scene of disimpassioned spectatorship A prostrate St John with his throat brutally slit bleeds on the ground while callous onlookers support a stoney faced executioner The only humanity in the painting is embodied by a single horrified woman The longer I stare baroque music washing across the oratory the more details emerge from the darkness Caravaggio s signature in the pool of blood this is his only signed work and the glint of the silver knife It induces awe not for ornate gilding like so much in the city but for intimate drama We re a small group of strangers collectively witnessing the stirring tragedy of this painting years after the artist put brush to canvas It s hard to compute all that Caravaggio s eternal masterpiece has witnessed in its long history or what it will see in years to come But for me a fleeting visitor to this place the concert becomes a vivid living postcard of my time in Valletta A brief but beautiful moment shared by many
