Netherlands Catherine Le Nevez May min read Share Everywhere in the Netherlands is easily accessible like Rotterdam with its mix of architecture Â Victor Maschek Shutterstock With its beautiful cities and countryside of polders dykes windmills and canals connected by superb sustainable infrastructure the Netherlands is one of the easiest places to travel As a visitor you wonâ t find too many potential pitfalls but there are still a few things to be aware of starting with getting its name right Having written about this charming and fascinating country for almost two decades and experienced it over a lifetime these are my key tips for a smooth trip Itâ s the Netherlands not Holland Youâ ll come across plenty of references to â Hollandâ as a synonym for the entire country itâ s only recently started transitioning out of use by the Dutch tourism authority but in fact Holland refers to just two of the countryâ s provinces Noord Holland North Holland Haarlem is the provincial capital while Amsterdam is the largest city and national capital and Zuid Holland South Holland Den Haag is the provincial capital and seat of government and royalty with Rotterdam the largest city The rest of the country is not Holland and the nation as a whole is the Netherlands You might also hear references to the Randstad the conurbation that takes in the Netherlandsâ biggest cities in Noord Holland Zuid Holland and Utrecht which forms the countryâ s economic engine and is home to almost half of its population Advertisement Beyond the city center catch a ferry to Amsterdam Noord s thriving creative hub Â Simon Montgomery Getty Images Remember thereâ s more to Amsterdam than the city center â and more to the Netherlands than Amsterdam Amsterdam is where most people arrive and for many itâ s their only destination With visitor numbers skyrocketing the Dutch capital is balancing overtourism through measures such as raising tourist taxes restricting short stay apartment rental and house swaps capping the number of annual overnight visitors halving river cruises and closing its ocean liner cruise ship port completely It is also deterring raucous hard partying â nuisance touristsâ by banning organized pub crawls and curbing central bar and club opening hours while still welcoming respectful visitors You donâ t have to go far from the center to discover fantastic often under the radar neighborhoods such as Amsterdamâ s West Oost East and Noord North where youâ ll get a deeper insight into local life Positive impact tours run by Tours That Matter are also a great way to get off the tourist track Added to that the Netherlandsâ compact size and excellent transport puts the countryâ s grand cities classic landscapes and exhilarating things to do and invariably cheaper prices right on Amsterdamâ s doorstep Decide how long to spend in the Netherlands Crossing the country takes just a few hours but thereâ s a lot to see A week will give you time to experience Amsterdam and surrounding destinations such as Haarlem Utrecht Leiden Delft Den Haag and Rotterdam The longer you have the more you can explore all corners of the country from the Frisian coast and islands to superbly preserved Hanseatic cities such as Deventer and Zwolle and the hilly southeast around vibrant Maastricht When youâ re putting together your itinerary you can get a good sense of travel times on journey planner nl which calculates the most efficient public transport routes throughout the country Traveling by bike using the countryâ s extensive system of short and long distance cycleways is also entirely viable and an enjoyable way to get around Cycling is part of the Dutch DNA locals ride literally everywhere work dinner the opera you name it so youâ ll be in good company Discover the best ways to get around the Netherlands It s best to pre book museum time slots like the Rijksmuseum Â Goncharovaia Shutterstock Book museum time slots in advance to avoid missing out As the home turf of artistic masters from Rembrandt and Vermeer to Van Gogh Mondrian and MC Escher the Netherlands brims with incredible art and hundreds of museums also showcase the countryâ s rich history traditions and diversity Increasingly museum entry requires you to reserve a time slot online These can quickly fill up in advance so book them a few weeks ahead even earlier for the Anne Frank Huis so you have a framework for the rest of your schedule Lock in accommodation and popular restaurant bookings ahead of time too Especially if youâ re traveling in the high summer season or during festivals events and holidays you should make sure you have your accommodation booked ahead High end and or popular restaurants should also be reserved well in advance Advertisement Dutch cycling culture means fashion is not only stylish it s also practical Â Frans Lemmens Getty Images Pack practically and plan for fickle weather Thereâ s a reason windmills are a fixture across the flat landscape it can get distinctly breezy here the uniquely Dutch verb uitwaaien means â to clear one s head by taking a walk outdoors in the windy fresh airâ and the maritime climate also means plenty of rain so pack waterproofs no matter the season Youâ ll also be glad of comfortable sturdy footwear for walking on all terrains a slimline daypack and layers you can quickly put on if things turn chilly Warm clothes gloves and a woolen hat are essential in winter The Dutch cycling culture means fashion is not only stylish Dutch design is big here but practical such as flat soles and clothing that wonâ t get caught in bicycle spokes Consider traveling to the Netherlands outside the summer peak hereâ s the best time to go Anticipate what to expect at your accommodation Accommodation in the Netherlands can spring a few surprises on the uninitiated In older buildings especially there might not be air conditioning and elevators might be tiny or non existent and Dutch staircases can be precipitously steep often more akin to shipsâ ladders Attitudes tend to be quite liberal and straightforward and bathrooms can be more open plan than you might expect and or have limited screening yes often even the toilets If modesty is important to you this is something youâ ll want to look into when booking once you check in alternative rooms might not be available To let natural light in hotels and residential homes and apartments often have large windows without blinds or drapes but in a small densely populated country people respect each otherâ s privacy Try the Dutch gin and be sure to make eye contact with everyone you re toasting Â Sarah Coghill Lonely Planet Get to grips with Dutch communication The Dutch are clear concise communicators favoring directness over small talk To visitors this might come across as bracingly frank but itâ s simply intended to be pragmatic open and honest Punctuality is expected in formal and social situations Excellent fluent English is widely spoken but a few words of Dutch can help grease the wheels of communication such as goedemorgen goedendag goedenavond good morning day evening tot ziens goodbye alstublieft alsjeblieft formal informal for please and dank u wel dank je wel formal informal for thank you Toast a frothy beer or jenever aka genever Dutch gin with proost cheers while making eye contact with everyone youâ re toasting Dutch drinking culture is social revolving around food and friends starting with borrel â drinksâ before uitgaan going out Embrace sustainability In a country lying mostly below sea level environmental concerns have long been top of mind and the Dutch are blazing the way on sustainability The Netherlands is aiming for a circular economy by reusing repairing and recycling renewable materials to eliminate waste and rapid progress is being achieved across day to day life Everything you can do as a visitor using eco friendly transport minimizing energy consumption packaging and food waste dining on local and organic produce and shopping sustainably will help Understand tipping etiquette In the Netherlands remuneration in hospitality professions includes service so staff here arenâ t working for tips That being said many people do tip moderately up to around for excellent service especially in restaurants and bars where drinks are brought to the table Carry both cards and cash Contactless cards and app based â smart walletâ digital payments are becoming increasingly common such as the public transport system and many businesses such as cafes restaurants and shops even some supermarkets in larger cities especially are entirely cashless On the flipside many traditional establishments donâ t take cards and only accept cash Itâ s handy to have a mix of cash and cards to cover your bases Beware of bike lanes local cyclists move quickly and usually take the right of way Â kavalenkau Shutterstock Beware of bike lanes Bike lane traffic can move much faster and in much higher volumes than you might expect Along with speedy cyclists beware of motorized electric bikes and larger cargo bikes As a pedestrian be vigilant when crossing the road Wandering into a bike lane without looking in both directions can cause serious accidents Drivers should be extra mindful If youâ re joining the locals and cycling yourself watch out for other cyclists and oblivious pedestrians as well as vehicles and ring your bicycle bell as a warning as often as necessary Cross tram tracks at a sharp angle to avoid your wheels getting stuck Before heading out familiarize yourself with the rules of participating in Dutch traffic Save this guide to the best cycling routes in the Netherlands Take care on and around canals The Netherlandsâ picturesque waterways in its cities towns and countryside are rarely if ever fenced or protected by barriers Keep an eye out especially if youâ re traveling with young children If youâ re renting a boat to explore one of the best things you can do in the Netherlands ensure life jackets are provided for all passengers including for kids Drink the tap water freely Tap water is high quality and safe to drink throughout the Netherlands any exceptions will be clearly indicated Donâ t be alarmed by the signal testing of sirens but do take them seriously in an emergency If youâ re here at noon on the first Monday of the month public holidays excepted youâ ll hear the Netherlandsâ public warning sirens sound for an uninterrupted one minute and seconds when theyâ re simultaneously tested across the country If you hear them at any other time you should assume itâ s an emergency such as a fire or flood and follow local instructions Stay safe and know how to find help if you need it The Netherlands is an extremely safe country but you should take the usual precautions in big cities and watch out for pickpockets in areas where tourists congregate such as main railway stations Protect against bicycle theft by parking in secure bike parking stations where possible and always use two locks one should be attached to a fixed structure like a bike rack For a minor illness or injury an apotheek pharmacy can provide advice and sell over the counter medication and advise where to get more specialized help Itâ s important to be aware that cannabis is illegal in the Netherlands and while small quantities up to are generally tolerated by authorities itâ s policed differently by municipalities across the country and some areas enforce cannabis smoking bans in public places
