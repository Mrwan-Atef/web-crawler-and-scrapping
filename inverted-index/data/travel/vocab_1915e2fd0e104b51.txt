librarians and tour guides for their best bets Find legends and lore on a mountain hike Walking is one of the best ways to get to know Ireland I ve been walking for about years but I m still trotting off to find new routes and all of the walks seem to have stories says John G O Dwyer author of Best Irish Walks One of his favorites is a moderately challenging hike that leads to Coumshingaun a lake hidden in County Waterford s Comeragh Mountains where century highwayman William Crotty is said to have stashed his treasure It s something special probably the biggest glacial coum tarn lake in western Europe says O Dwyer You can accomplish it in four hours and it s still off the beaten path For a two day option O Dwyer suggests St Finbarr a mile trail following a traditional spiritual route in County Cork It s out of the way crosses four mountains and three valleys and ends with a magnificent sweep into heritage site Gougane Barra in the southwest A four hour loop trail in the Comeragh

Castle in Tralee is captivated by Cloughoughter Castle in County Cavan Nestled on a small island this dreamy castle is like something from a fairytale she says The fact that it s so remote and can only be accessed by boat adds to its intrigue and allure Visitors can see it from the shore and reach it via kayak with outfitters like Cavan Adventure Centre This immense fairy tale castle was built for one person Tee off at Donegal s undiscovered fairways Think of golf in Ireland and iconic courses spring to mind including Old Head in Kinsale or Adare Manor where the Ryder Cup returns in But Donegal s string of stunning links lie relatively undiscovered by most visiting golfers says travel writer Fionn Davenport He suggests teeing off at Rosapenna or Dunfanaghy both of whose links curve along Sheephaven Bay on the Wild Atlantic Way Dunfanagy features two of the loveliest holes in Ireland the par three ninth a yard bump across a rocky beach to a challenging two tiered green and the
