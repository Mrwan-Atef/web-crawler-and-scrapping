Fletcher Mar min read Share Plan your weekend away in Miami with this guide to the best things to do in and around South Beach Alamy A New York winter even a mild one turns one s skin to an ashen hue that is death like The solution is to head south Miami has long been an escape for those of us trapped in the doldrums of the Northeast I try to get there every year and Iâ ve mastered the long weekend I like to stretch my weekends whenever I can to include the whole of Friday and I stay in Miami Beach because I want to see the ocean as often as possible Here are my recommendations along with a few tips Advertisement When to arrive If you can arrive on Thursday night to make it a day weekend How to get from the airport Grab an Uber or Lyft from the airport â there is not a lot of good public transportation Expect to pay around a fare to get to South Beach Do better MIA Getting around town Miami Beach has free trolleys that will shuttle you pretty much wherever you want to go with an app that provides live tracking info Thereâ s also Citi Bike Where to stay There are so many hotels in South Beach from the budget friendly Freehand Miami to the less budget friendly Ritz Carlton South Beach These days I stay at a friend s apartment which is basically an AirBnB with my bffs as hosts What to pack Take your casual beach clothes and something a bit more snazzy if you plan to go out for dinner Don t forget a hat bathing suit good walking shoes and SPF Visiting Miami on a budget Check out our top money saving tips Miami s beach and boardwalk are quiet first thing in the morning Â mariakray Shutterstock Friday Morning Wake up early and make your way to the boardwalk for a morning stroll Stop for coffee along the way Crema â either on Collins or on Washington near â is a terrific local coffee choice Grab yourself an iced coffee and croissant to go Or sip a traditional Cuban cafecito from one of these places The boardwalk is miles from South Pointe all the way north to Surfside Between and I like to walk some of it often stopping to take photos of the colorful retro lifeguard stands It s quiet and calm at this time and sometimes I ll take off my shoes and get my feet wet walking along the shoreline Top tip set a timer if you have other responsibilities today â such as work â it s easy to lose track of time How to spend the day Working from Miami is the jam I like the Betsy Hotel â s Panther Coffee shop which is at the rear of the hotel and has its own entrance The Betsyâ s whole vibe is literary and artsy with vintage photographs on the walls As a writer editor it really gets my creative juices flowing Iâ ll pop over to La Sandwicherie for lunch and eat that on the grass at Lummus Park a block away Advertisement Dinner Dinner at Joeâ s Stone Crab is an initiation for first timers Operating since it has been a Miami dining institution for over a century and still draws throngs to tie on a bib and suck on succulent crab meat It tops many best lists for a very good reason freshness â Joe s catches its own crabs I also recommend Mandolin a bistro that specializes in Aegean cuisine with influences from the Greek Islands and the Turkish coast After dark Iâ m an early bird and Miami is a late night party town I donâ t do the latter so feel free to open a new window to see Thrillistâ s excellent guide to Miamiâ s club scene but please come back Local Flavor These are the best places to eat and drink in Miami Buy a day pass and spend Saturday at one of Miami s top hotel pools Â aureag Getty Images Saturday Morning Wake up and walk to Pura Vida a healthy ish local chain where you can get breakfast sandwiches and other treats that cater to vegetarians and vegans all day long â I love the avocado toast How to spend the day Saturday is pool day and you have plenty of choices Most pools have DJs and private cabanas for rent but there are smaller more mellow places to relax too I like the chilled out vibes of Carillion Wellness Resort Whatever youâ re after your secret weapon to access a hotel pool is Resort Pass It sells day passes at various price points to several South Beach hotel pools as well as beach and spa passes so you donâ t need to stay the night to enjoy the day I like to stroll the boardwalk again because in contrast to Friday morning s tranquility it is a scene on a Saturday with people walking biking running and rollerblading The parade of distinct humanity youâ ll encounter is truly one of South Beachâ s best sights along with its architecture of course more on that later Dinner Saturday night begs for dinner at Tropazon on EspaÃ ola Way It does close your eyes and youâ re in Spain tapas and its gin selection is miraculous I love a snacky dinner that gives the table a chance to taste everything and I love gin even more After dark Head to Medium Cool for a nightcap and live jazz â the perfect way to wind down a Miami Saturday Spend Sunday wandering the antique market at Lincoln Rd Â Shutterstock Sunday Morning Go to the Lincoln Road Antique and Collectible Market in the morning It is so fun to browse for anything from table lamps to caftans to vintage band t shirts Graze for your breakfast at the onsite farmers market How to spend the day Grab a quick casual lunch and a glass of wine at A Folie Cafe a small French bistro on a less touristy block of EspaÃ ola Way before heading out on an Art Deco Walking Tour I like to save the best for last and this tour is the ultimate way to see all of the architectural icons in South Beach An expert guide will share historical tidbits about the influences of old Hollywood and the mob as well as more contextual information about art deco design itself Then youâ ll have to head back to the airport But Miami has so much to see and do and Iâ ve only scratched the surface Check out all our Miami and Florida coverage especially if youâ re planning a longer trip Adios South Beach Ready to plan your trip to Miami Add these top experiences to
