the Winter Olympics take over Cortina d Ampezzo where ski mountaineering or skimo will make its debut as an Olympic sport Photograph by robertharding Alamy Stock Photo TRAVEL Take a ski safari across the Dolomites home of the Winter Olympics The fastest skiers in the world are celebrated in Italy s northern Alps but anyone can ski here Here s how to get the most out of your trip to this popular and culturally rich destination By Kathleen Rellihan February It s the seventh day of my week long ski safari across the Dolomites and I find I have the mountain to myself for a moment I m skiing a five mile run winding past dreamy icefalls against a backdrop of limestone pinnacles Other than my guide there isn t another skier in sight While Italy s famed Dolomite Mountains are certainly no secret especially to Europeans more North Americans are finding that skiing in Italy s northern UNESCO recognized Alps comes with endless and spectacular ski terrain and a unique mix of cultures And as the home of the Winter Olympics there s no doubt the crowds and spotlight will certainly grow in this already popular ski destination Cortina d Ampezzo is the buzzy hub of the Winter Olympics and Italy s most famous ski town think of it as the Aspen of Italy Since the annual Women s World Cup championships have been held here and they were underway when I visited last January Related Discover w hy an Italian ski trip offers the best value for money Cortina became a world famous resort synonymous with chic skiing after it hosted the Winter Olympics And now years after its Olympic debut Cortina will co host along with Milan the Winter Games again On my ski safari with Dolomite Mountains an Italian based active outdoor travel company I found the crowds and the glitzy vibe wane as we traveled beyond Cortina Each day as we skied fresh terrain to a new cozy mountainside rifugio or hotel while our luggage was zipped away to the next spot for us we experienced different ski resorts and mountain valleys each with their unique culture and sometimes even language Unlike backcountry skiing seen here a ski safari is usually on groomed slopes and accessible by lifts Photograph by H Mark Weidman Photography Alamy Stock Photo In Cortina I appreciated the chance to swish down Olympic and World Cup slopes Still my most memorable run was the five mile Armentarola piste in the valley of Alta Badia of South Tyrol While more skiers joined us as we skied down this epic long ski run I was pleasantly surprised to see why a small crowd of people formed at the bottom A horse drawn carriage awaited to tow me and about other skiers for three euros to the next ski area It s not something I have experienced at any other ski resort elsewhere in the world While the fastest skiers in the world are celebrated in the Dolomites anyone can ski here My ski safari was entirely on piste no backcountry ski experience necessary with ski lifts and gondolas moving us around the area all on one ski pass The Dolomiti Superski is the world s largest ski area with ski resorts and over groomed slopes serviced by lifts and gondolas You never have to ski the same run twice here Related The Italian Dolomites are known for skiing Now they can be your nature and wellness getaway Three different languages and cultures Beyond the kilometers miles of interconnected slopes another unique aspect of the Dolomites is the medley of cultures three different cultures and languages are spoken in this region From the signs to the dishes you ll see and experience different cultures just a few kilometers and a ski slope away Italian German and Ladin a Rhaeto Romanic language for more than years are all spoken in the Dolomites The region s crossroads history is seen in the mix of Italian and Austrian flavors too You have the Italian Austrian and Ladin cultures all blended in this area So when you go skiing you can see a little bit of the difference says Agustina Lagos Marmol founder of Dolomite Mountains known for creating custom outdoor experiences Raised in Patagonia she s committed to preserving the region s unique mountain culture and ensuring her company s impact remains positive for generations to come Dolomite Mountains is a member of The Long Run a collection of purpose driven tourism businesses and it offsets the direct impact of its activities by supporting conservation projects in Val di Fiemme and mitigates the indirect impact of its guests by contributing to the Amazon River conservation project in Brazil They aim to be a climate positive company by

alpine inns here offer incredible views and elevated cuisines a fusion of flavors from the different Italian Austrian and Ladin cultures found in these valleys In Cortina you must try casunziei its signature dish of beetroot ravioli In the Ladin speaking Val Gardena valley of South Tyrol apple strudel is king In Alto Adige warm up with canederli traditional bread dumplings influenced by its Austrian neighbors With all this terrain to cover having a local guide is paramount This is not your ski instructor but a guide who handles all the logistics and knows all the slopes All we had to focus on was skiing instead of being glued to a map Beyond showing us the best runs every day my guides Carlo and Marco shared interesting tidbits about the Dolomites history and culture as we rode up the mountain in a gondola or took a break for lunch Related How to scale the iron paths of the Dolomites Where to stay before and during the Olympics Right now is a good time to visit because you don t have the Olympics prices suggests Marmol I think after the Olympics there will be changes on the horizon especially in the area of Cortina It s becoming more and more popular because of the Olympics and for North Americans Marmol foresees a rise in the number of high end hotels opening in the area And while I recommend you pepper your trip with some nights in a hotel with a sauna and other amenities to restore your tired muscles the small family run inns and refugios make skiing here unlike anywhere else in the world Marmol is also a co owner of the renovated and reopened Rifugio Sponata in the Alta Badia Valley Some hotels offer a mix of high end and local vibes Hotel de LEN is a modern and environmentally friendly nod to the Dolomites Ladin culture with its Climax Hotel certified energy efficient wood design It s in the heart of Cortina and I saw the ski slopes light up at night from the rooftop spa s open air hut tub and overlooked Cortina s church steeple and snow covered rooftops from the sauna Hotel La Perla Corvara in Alta Badia balances Ladin hospitality with contemporary luxury and is home to Michelin starred La St√ºa de Michil And while prices and hotel rooms will rise there s still a focus on reviving the alpine spirit of the past here too I took the new retro snow train that was put back into service in from Rome to the Dolomites and will resume for the Winter Olympics This vintage sleeper train route was brought back due to the popularity of night train service and to offer a sustainable way for travelers to get to the Dolomites The slow way can still be an adventure here too Related These are the must see sights of Italy s Veneto region How to get to the Dolomites Snow covered Lake Misurina is the largest natural lake of the Cadore a
