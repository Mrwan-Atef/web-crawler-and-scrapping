kayak close to the seals as long as you don t disturb them or snorkel or dive amid some of the world s richest kelp forests Even traveling on an excursion boat gives you a chance to view sea lions brown pelicans and spouting whales Scientists have uncovered many treasures during decades of research on these relatively undeveloped islands Archaeological evidence at Santa Rosa Island s Arlington Springs site shows that people lived in coastal California years ago and traveled by watercraft throughout the region The native Chumash lived on the islands until the late when Spaniards settled in California Unfortunately European diseases and the demise of the trade based economy devastated the indigenous population and the few remaining Chumash islanders left in Over the ensuing decades other humans set up fishing and otter hunting camps and built ranches on the islands the U S Navy also established several military installations All commercial operations have now ceased and the park has embarked on an ambitious project to restore the natural habitats Relatively few people travel out to the park If you re among the few who do make the effort know that a splendid land and sea
