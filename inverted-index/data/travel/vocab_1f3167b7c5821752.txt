time for your visit to Panama with this guide to what s happening throughout the year Rainer Lesniewski Shutterstock With beautiful islands a rich Indigenous culture wildlife filled rainforests cosmopolitan cities and two magnificent coastlines to explore Panama is somewhere to linger but it pays to consider the climate when planning a trip Panama lies just nine degrees north of the equator buffeted by the trade winds of the Pacific and Caribbean meaning a tropical drenching often comes with the territory However with warm temperatures every month of the year a little rain isn t always a bad thing The best time for your trip to Panama will depend on what you plan to do while you re here If you want to bask on golden sands or trek into the rainforest visit during the dry season from December to April The best waves for surfing are unleashed along the coast from April to December while divers and wildlife spotters gather from August to September when humpback whales sharks and orcas congregate off the Pacific shoreline Donâ t underestimate the impact of Panamanian public holidays Normal life shuts down completely for seasonal celebrations such as DÃ a de la Independencia in November the Easter celebrations in April and Christmas in December To help you plan here s our guide to the best times of year to visit Panama The Caribbean and Pacific coasts have their own micro climates â and it s always damp in the rainforest Shutterstock Regional climate variations in Panama Many locals say Panama actually has two climates â one for the Caribbean and one for the Pacific A visit to the Caribbean Coast can be a damp experience at any time of year though the sun usually puts in an appearance in the morning and afternoon The driest months are February March and April The Pacific Coast sees sunny skies and peak prices during the dry season from December to April when hordes of sun seekers flock south from the US The rainiest months are usually October and November including in the capital Panama City Expect high humidity in the dense forests of Panama s national parks at any time of year Festival season may be crowded but it s a wonderful time to see Panama full of color and music Getty Images Easter November Christmas and New Year are the best times for festivals Panamanians go all out for festivals and Christian feast days so these holidays are always a lively time to visit Plan your travel well ahead of time for any public holiday â hotel prices can rise to double the normal rate and transport is often booked out weeks in advance Panama is warm year round but temperatures creep even higher from December peaking around Easter when daytime highs of are common Locals flock to the coast in big family groups and beaches can be mobbed so arrive early to stake out a patch of sand If you visit in March or April plan to be somewhere near the ocean or a waterfall You ll still find plenty of surfers enjoying the swells on both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts in March and if Easter falls in the same month things can get very busy The Semana Santa Holy Week celebrations blaze a trail through Panama in the week before Easter with processions and re enactments of the crucifixion held all over the country The best way to stay connected Saily provides a hassle free solution to travel data â just choose your data plan and prepare for your trip When you get to your destination you can go online right away Get your eSIM Note that Easter coincides with spring break when North American college students join the tourist throng adding to the demand for accommodations and transport As April rolls on tourist numbers dwindle meaning lower prices and less competition for rooms and flights With great weather and a fiesta vibe Christmas is a busy time in Panama Mark Pitt Shutterstock Don t expect to get much done in Panama in November â the whole country takes off to celebrate multiple festivals related to the nation s independence from both Spain and Colombia such as Day and DÃ a de la Independencia Panama City empties out and beaches fill up but thereâ s still plenty of rain and the showers can be torrential at times The warm up for the Christmas holidays impacts travel throughout December Locals move around the country in huge numbers and tourists start to flock in from elsewhere particularly North Americans seeking winter sunshine The period between Christmas and New Year sees maximum demand and peak prices With both the dry season and tourist season at their peaks January is a big month for travel in Panama particularly in beach areas The weather creates prime conditions for kitesurfing with Pacific temperatures at their warmest and consistent breezes along the coast The mountain town of Boquete is filled with people and blooms for its flower and coffee festival and music fills the streets of Panama City during the Panama Jazz Festival Warm dry weather keeps tourists coming to the Pacific Coast well into February and the Caribbean Coast also sees plenty of visitors Depending on the timing of Ash Wednesday February can be one of the busiest times of the year as the Carnaval rolls into Panama City The short shoulder seasons are good times to hit the beach in Panama Daniel Lange iStock Mid December and mid April are the best times for dry weather The prime time to visit Panama is during the dry season but youâ ll have to share the experience Beach areas are swamped by local and international visitors from Christmas through Easter but a little quieter during the short shoulder seasons in mid December and mid April These are top times for hiking in Boquete and exploring the San Blas Archipelago but the wind can reduce visibility for snorkelers Savvy travelers mix up time on the coast with trips to explore the dense rainforests in the interior Be aware that â dry seasonâ is a relative term in Panama While the Pacific Coast â Panama City and anywhere south of the continental divide â basks under sunny skies the highlands and Caribbean Coast still get some showers With the flood of winter sun seekers expect lots of competition for rooms transport and space on the beach all over Panama Prices are high everywhere and hotel rates are not far off the festival peak throughout the dry season Panamanians celebrate a run of regional fairs and festivals during the rainy season Marek Poplawski Shutterstock Mid April to early December is the best time for budget travelers The rainy season from mid April to the start of December is the quietest and cheapest time to visit Panama but youâ ll definitely get wet There are regular rain showers some of them torrential but it doesnâ t rain all day every day â youâ ll still get a daily dose of vitamin D when the sun peeks out With sporadic refreshing rain showers the weather is generally pleasant throughout Panama in May This is the start of the five to six month nesting season for loggerhead and green sea turtles on the Caribbean coast and it s the best time to visit if you d like to observe turtles in the wild Humidity soars in June and July and rain showers grow more frequent with regular thunderstorms Tourist numbers are low and so are prices and the worst rains are still several months away Locals dressed as devils hit the streets for Corpus Christi mixing up Catholic tradition with Panamanian customs and music and dancing light up Santa Catalina as locals celebrate the Fiesta de Virgen del Carmen The rainy months bring excellent surfing conditions around Santa Catalina Kristina Vackova Shutterstock The rainy season coincides with the best swells on both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts attracting plenty of surfers August and September are also the prime months to visit Parque Nacional Coiba and the ArchipiÃ lago de Las Perlas for sightings of sharks whales and orcas whale sharks arrive later in January This is a time to travel strategically in late October and early November the rain can be unrelenting so it pays to be based somewhere with plenty of things to do indoors such as Panama City or David On the flip side crowds dissipate and prices drop to affordable levels across the country Bucking the national trend September and October are the driest months to visit the Bocas del Toro islands You ll also get the opportunity to enjoy the festival of the sea Feria Internacional del Mar celebrated with folk music and a feast of seafood in September In October Panamanians celebrate regional fairs such as Isla Tigre in San Blas In Portobelo the Festival del Cristo Negro attracts thousands of devout pilgrims from all over the country who come to pay penance and party Scuba diving is a year round activity including during the rainy season but land based activities can be trickier During the rainiest months travel can be almost impossible in parts of the highlands and smart travelers focus on the cities and the coast Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with
