into circus shows music concerts and even magic Las Vegas has something for you Â Lawrence K Ho Getty Images In Help Me Choose we ask our expert writers to help us make the best decision for our trip In this edition we asked Las Vegas expert Jesse Scott to help us narrow down all those amazing Vegas shows One thing is clear within your first minutes in Las Vegas â the cityâ s shows want your attention Advertisements for Vegas signature entertainment plaster the baggage claim area at Harry Reid International Airport On your drive to your hotel itâ s billboards aplenty outside the airport on Interstate and even atop taxis It doesnâ t stop there â youâ ll see digital billboards attached to the back of slowly sauntering trucks on The Strip Advertisement With so many options in so many forms â spanning comedy music residencies magic and everything in between â it can be difficult to pick just one or even a couple to check out during your stay In a city full of good and bad bets these are your best bets when it comes to choosing a Las Vegas show The Las Vegas show to see for a little bit of everything Cirque du Soleil Through the decades Cirque du Soleil has become synonymous with Las Vegas The Canadian bred entertainment company specializes in circus shows each with their own artistic flair immersive experiences colorful characters and customized tunes While some Cirque shows make stops in major cities throughout the world a number of hotels on The Strip have Cirque du Soleil residencies that you can only see in Las Vegas Among your top picks Mystere at Treasure Island was the very first Cirque show to arrive in Sin City and has been a family friendly staple since Fans of The Beatles should head next door to The Mirage where LOVE has been rockinâ since â the only drawback compared to many other Cirque shows is that it does not have live music O at The Bellagio is another standout with a water filled setting including divers and synchronized swimmers in addition to Cirqueâ s typical dosage of high flying acrobats The Sphere is an eye catching addition to Vegas impressive venues Â Anadolu Getty Images visual wizardry Sphere Itâ s been the talk of the town since opening in late Sphere is equally as captivating outside and inside thanks to its exterior shell made of million hockey puck sized lights that work together to create a variety of larger than life images that are visible from miles away a giant fireball a jack o lantern a massive emoji the moon and more Inside youâ ll find seating for nearly and the worldâ s largest wraparound LED display Inside and out it is visually stunning Advertisement It s free to gawk at its exterior shell â you can easily do so from the neighboring Venetian Palazzo Wynn and Encore resorts As for catching a show inside Sphere has multiple daily showings of its nature focused show Postcards from Earth which puts its audio and visual capabilities on full display Some of the biggest bands on Earth like and Phish have notably signed on to play Sphere If youâ re going for a concert experience snag floor seats to appreciate the bandâ s performance as much as possible â otherwise youâ ll easily be distracted by all of Sphereâ s video enchantments the entire time a little magic David Copperfield From Siegfried and Roy taming tigers to David Copperfield making everything under the sun disappear Las Vegas has been the home of legendary magicians galore You can still catch Copperfield at MGM Grand â heâ s been going strong at the iconic Strip property since For such a big name â if not the biggest name in magic â heâ s super down to earth live weaving in stories of family getting the audience involved and for an upcharge hosting meet and greets with fans Beyond Copperfield fellow magician Criss Angel has been a Vegas mainstay for nearly two decades premiering at Luxor and now having a residency at Planet Hollywood Whereas Copperfield has a more sophisticated and refined vibe Angelâ s showmanship definitely appeals to a younger and edgier crowd Absinthe delivers a sexy take on the circus variety show Â Las Vegas Review Journal Getty Images something sexy Absinthe This is Sin City and sometimes you just want some raunch For that perfect overdose of art meets sexiness Absinthe is it Tucked in a white tent on the Roman Plaza in front of Caesars Palace this show blends burlesque comedy and circus acts in one minute experience The show is hosted by a quirky host â known as Gazillionaire â and well heâ s about as vulgar as it gets Whatever Absinthe is doing it has been working for nearly two decades in a very prime location As for an equally as sexy alternative Rogue at The STRAT debuted in and features nearly two dozen topless performers with contortionists comedians and aerialists woven throughout Like many shows in Las Vegas Rogue runs Tuesdays through Sundays with Monday as an off day for performers How to prepare for a Las Vegas show Snagging a deal Check the showâ s resort box office on site for advanced and day of discounts â you may be comped tickets with certain tiers of a casinoâ s rewards players club also operates kiosks along The Strip with deeply discounted tickets What to wear Strict dress codes are a thing of the past at Vegas shows Do dress warm as most venues â and casinos for that matter â like to blast the air conditioning particularly during the summer months When to book tickets The sooner you purchase tickets the better the seats will be â Better seatsâ can be contingent on what youâ re seeing â for example opt to sit close to the stage for a magic show whereas select seats mid venue for a Cirque show so you can take in the full scope of everything on stage Where to park The bulk of casinos now charge for parking Three properties on The Strip offer free parking â Sahara Treasure Island and Circus Circus Artist residencies like Adele s offer the perfect chance to see your favorites in concert Â Kevin Mazur Getty Images Letâ s not forget music residencies and comedians too Adele Katy Perry Garth Brooks Barry Manilow Maroon and ventriloquist comedian Terry Fator are among the laundry list of big time acts to have current and or recent residencies in Sin City The schedule of â a residencyâ can vary greatly â equating to a one week stretch of shows to sporadic weekend visits to a venue over the course of a year If youâ ve heard your favorite musician or comedian has a Vegas residency your best bet is to check their tour calendar for Vegas dates and build a trip around that versus showing up in Sin City and expecting them to have a show Keep planning your trip to Las Vegas Plan a slam dunk itinerary with of the best things to do in Las Vegas Sin City can be overwhelming â here s our First
