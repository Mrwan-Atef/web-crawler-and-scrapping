photography in Kenya with incredible light and colors Â SerrNovik Getty Images With about half the country on either side of the equator Kenya â s climate isnâ t a straightforward split of dry and wet seasons In fact its dry season has a short wet season and its wet season is interrupted by a dry one â clear as mud right What this means practically is thereâ s not exactly a single best time to visit Kenya There is somewhere ideal to visit at any time of year but for the Great Migration bird migration or quality diving youâ ll need to pick specific months For climbers the dry season is prime time for safety and visibility Temperatures are generally consistent across Kenya with the coast hotter â but humidity can vary It can get cold in the mountains and Kenyaâ s highest peak Mt Kenya is always covered in snow Advertisement This East African nation counts more than Indigenous communities in its population of nearly million people and many festivals and events explore this diversity â from the Lamu Cultural Festival celebrating the archipelagoâ s Swahili heritage and the exuberant Mombasa Carnival to the diverse gathering that is the Lake Turkana Festival Seeing wildebeest during the Great Migration is a key reason to visit Kenya in high season Â Abdelrahman M Hassanein Getty Images July to October and January to February are the best times to see the Great Migration If the wildebeest migration is on your must see list head to the Masai Mara from July onward to observe one of natureâ s greatest sights â thousands of wildebeest zebras and giraffes making the move across the Serengeti These high season months are an enjoyable time to visit any of Kenyaâ s parks because the grass is thin thereâ s little rainfall and sightings are easier as animals congregate around waterholes they re also climber friendly because of good visibility and lack of rain July is also a good time to spot huge flocks of pink flamingos at Lake Nakuru Much like July August is one of the best all around months to visit Kenya but itâ s a busy time The Great Migration is well and truly underway and wildebeest are filling the plains of the Masai Mara If youâ re not in the Mara August is an excellent time to visit other national parks and conservancies around Kenya You can also visit Nairobi without the humid stickiness that makes urban exploring harder work The capitalâ s food scene is popping and Nairobi Restaurant Week is a chance to get your fill For a hyper local experience in Samburu County in northern Kenya the one day Maralal Camel Derby is a colorful display of camels costumes and culture September offers the best of July and August in terms of weather and wildlife but with slightly fewer crowds especially in the latter part of the month You can still catch the migration as hot dry weather sets in and thereâ s almost no chance of rain It s also when the East African Community Arts Festival JAMAFEST takes place Itâ s every two years and rotates between East African nations Nairobi hosts the Tusker Safari Sevens in October an annual Rugby Sevens tournament open to international teams creating a buzz in the city October is Mashujaa Day also known as Heroes Day honoring those involved in Kenyaâ s independence movement Itâ s a public holiday and Nairobi and coastal areas are buzzing as Kenyans head to the beaches and parks Advertisement Hot and dry the high season beckons as the new year begins January is a popular and busy time for everything safari hiking city exploring diving snorkeling and beach stays Dry season is particularly good and safe for climbing Mt Kenya and other peaks and for hiking in places such as Hellâ s Gate National Park You can usually benefit from low season prices at Masai Mara because the big migration is over and migratory birds fly into the Mara instead Celebrate the dawn of a new year on a Mombasa beach the city hosts major celebrations February sees both the high and dry seasons in Kenya The lack of rain makes it a popular choice for safari with minimal muddy terrain and plenty of wildlife to see Itâ s also a top time for climbing and hiking although as it s peak season crowds and prices can both increase March promises good visibility for snorkeling and diving in Mombasa on Kenya s coast Â mgokalp Getty Images November December and March are the best times for lush landscapes and underwater adventures November is a fun month for festival lovers with both Mombasa Carnival and Lamu Cultural Festival celebrating the rich heritage of Kenyaâ s ethnic groups and communities Floats music and dance epitomize Mombasaâ s street party while on the archipelago of Lamu off the northern coast Lamu Cultural Festival includes traditional dancing called ngoma and centuries old skills such as dhow sailboat building donkey racing fish trap making and dhow regattas For Kenyaâ s South Asian population Diwali New Year celebrations take place sometimes in October so the temples are buzzing decorations are up and thereâ s an above average production of Indian mithai sweets Weather is mixed with sun and rain but November remains a good bet for safari If you like your landscapes lush and abundant December in Kenya is magical The rains tend to stop around the middle of the month and Kenyaâ s parks take on a gorgeous green hue ahead of the upcoming second â high seasonâ of January and February Water visibility is optimal during the shoulder season too so this is a great time for divers and snorkelers December marks Jamhuri Day Jamhuri means republic in Swahili and this day is when Kenya marks its independence from Britain and its constitution as a republic a year later with cultural events dances and music The two day Rusinga Cultural Festival on Lake Victoria celebrates the threatened culture of the Abasuba people while the Beneath the Baobabs Festival in Kilifi is one of the countryâ s best music festivals with East African and international performers giant art and cool costumes It s getting hotter and more humid as the rainy season beckons but March remains a particularly enjoyable time to be in Kenya Prices can be in the travelerâ s favor and often the rains arrive later in the month so you should be fine in the earlier half Diving and snorkeling are rewarding in March with clear water and good visibility and beach parties are especially welcome on these balmy evenings as the hot dry season begins to give way to the rains Muslim Kenyans observe the holy month of Ramadan while for walkers climbers and outdoors types the Mount Kenya Festival is a celebration of the countryâ s highest peak Lush green landscapes are a feature of Kenya s wet season Â Carlos Amarillo Shutterstock April to June is the best time for smaller crowds and lower prices The â long rainsâ hit in April and May and sometimes in March too While the rainy season can be off putting for some travelers this time of year can be incredibly rewarding and the Mara remains accessible in March Crowds thin out and you can enjoy the quietness and solitude of nature Some safari lodges and camps close during this time because constant rain can hamper visibility in some parks and the humidity can be uncomfortable Itâ s still a great time to be by the coast but heavy rains can reduce visibility for divers and snorkelers But don t dismiss May for safari or wildlife viewings Yes the grasses are longer and sightings are trickier but the light and colors can be extraordinary for photography Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya is a good choice as wildlife gathers on the riverbanks of the Ewaso Ngiro River June is a wonderful time to experience Kenyaâ s highlands and with low humidity walking and climbing become a little easier This shoulder season month is a lovely time for wildlife viewing especially in northern Kenya after the long rains and itâ s also the start of the migration The coast is mostly dry and prices are a little lower before the high season kicks off in July Parades singing and dancing take place on Madaraka Day on June â the anniversary of Kenyaâ s move to self rule The visually spectacular Lake Turkana Festival in the Rift Valley brings together different ethnic groups in the region to both celebrate their diverse cultures and promote peace If youâ re into off road racing or want to watch the Rhino Charge a race that raises funds to conserve mountain ecosystems is quite a spectacle Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off your first order Email address
