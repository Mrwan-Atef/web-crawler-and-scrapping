maze like a pro A Barcelona expert answers your burning travel questions things to do this summer in Barcelona All about Gaudi You can t come to Barcelona without checking out architect Antoni Gaudi s incredible works The architect became one of the icons of modern art in the late and early century and I fell in love with his surreal designs for churches mansions and even parks across the city Here s my hit list of my favorite spots to take in his genius Meena Thiruvengadam Chicago IL Basílica de la Sagrada Familia of bubbles This elaborate Art Nouveau church Gaudi s most legendary landmark is still unfinished more than a century after the work began But it has come a long way in the decade since I first visited On my latest trip I joined an exclusive after hours tour which gave me the time and space to truly appreciate what makes this place so special Park Güell of bubbles This city park is part urban green space part architectural gem it looks like something out of a Modernist fairy tale My advice Book a ticket online for one of the last available entry times I spent about an hour wandering the grounds and taking in the city views Don t miss the Gaudi House Museum in the park where he lived for nearly years Casa Milà La Pedrera of bubbles Also known as La Pedrera this was the last private apartment building that Gaudi designed I took a pre opening tour that allowed me to beat the crowds Walking through the space plus a couple of restored apartments felt like a stroll through the past and gave a taste of what it might have been like to call this Modernist building home Ciutadella Park of bubbles This may be Gaudi s only waterfall and you ll find it just beyond the Passeig de Pujades entrance to Parc de la Ciutadella which was Barcelona s only city park until the mid century Gaudi worked mostly behind the scenes on this project helping engineer its water tank and hydraulics Look for the two stone medallions emblazoned with lizards near the top of the fountain inspired by the Trevi Fountain in Rome Casa Vicens Gaudí of bubbles This Modernist building doesn t get the same attention as Casa Batllo and Casa Mila but it s worth seeing Built in the late this was one of Gaudi s first major projects and his unique spin on this Orientalist structure caused a stir when it opened You can buy tickets that can be used at any time on a specific day making it ideal for spontaneous travelers like myself Casa Batlló of bubbles A UNESCO World Heritage Site this is one of Gaudi s best known residential projects Gaudi was brought in to remodel the building in I bought tickets to visit on my own before opening In my opinion the interior doesn t offer as much to see as Casa Mila but it s a treat to see the view from the other side of the building s iconic stained glass windows Browse collections Get ideas on what to do see and eat Party of one Hotels tours and more for the solo traveler LGBTQ Barcelona after dark A guide to Eixample s nightlife Spring
