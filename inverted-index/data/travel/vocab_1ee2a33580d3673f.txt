to honor the seven planetary deities and later transformed into a church the Pantheon is the best preserved of Rome s ancient monuments and one of the most influential buildings in the Western world Emperor Hadrian commissioned this feat of engineering to be erected on the site of Marcus Agrippa s earlier BCE temple and has stood in the heart of Rome since around CE And while its graying pockmarked exterior might look its age it s still a unique and exhilarating experience to pass through its vast bronze doors and gaze up at the sky through the wide oculus the circular opening at the dome s apex in the center of what was the world s largest dome up to the century The Pantheon is vast you ll feel very small as you look up at the record breaking dome soaring above your head Adding to the effect are the shafts of light that stream in through the central oculus illuminating the royal tombs set into the marble clad interior With its revolutionary design this awe inspiring temple has served as an architectural blueprint for millennia The Pantheon has been an architectural blueprint for millennia Resul Muslu Shutterstock History For centuries the inscription under the pediment M AGRIPPA L F COS TERTIUM FECIT or Marcus Agrippa son of Lucius in his third consulate built this led scholars to think that the current building was Agrippa s original temple However century excavations revealed traces of an earlier temple and historians realized that Hadrian had simply kept Agrippa s original inscription Hadrian s temple was dedicated to the classical gods hence the name Pantheon a derivation of the Greek words pan all and theos god but in CE it was consecrated as a Christian church and it s now officially known as the Basilica di Santa Maria ad Martyres To avoid the massive dome with over in diameter from collapsing into itself Roman architects used increasingly lighter materials to reach the eye meant to be both a light source and a direct connection with the deities Thanks to this consecration it was spared the worst of the medieval plundering that reduced many of Rome s ancient buildings to near dereliction But it didn t escape entirely unscathed in August Pope Urban VIII a member of the Barberini family decided to remove the Pantheon s gilded bronze roof tiles and bronze from the portico and have Gianlorenzo Bernini use it to build his baldachin at St Peter s Basilica The theft gave rise to the saying Quod non fecerunt barbari fecerunt Barberini What the barbarians didn t do the Barberini did The Pantheon s exterior is a massively imposing sight with Corinthian columns each high and each made from a single block of Egyptian granite supporting a triangular pediment Rivets and holes in the brickwork indicate where the original marble veneer panels were removed During the Renaissance the building was much studied Brunelleschi used it as inspiration for his cupola in Florence and it became an important burial chamber In the cavernous marble clad interior you ll find the tomb of the artist Raphael alongside those of kings Vittorio Emanuele II and Umberto I Tips and other practicalities The Pantheon is open daily from to
