Advertisement Take your pick of Lahore s many different food streets Â Shutterstock Gorge yourself on Lahoreâ s food streets Let your stomach lead you when youâ re deciding on things to do in Lahore There are more than half a dozen roads famed for their street food and in the evening the air is thick with the smell of spices and barbecuing meats Gawalmandi Food Street and Fort Street probably have the best selection of food stalls though Old Anarkali Food Street gives them a run for their money As well as richly spiced kebabs be sure to try katlama deep fried bread marinated in tomato and chili paste and served with lentils and grato jalebi â colorful cardamom flavored sweets fried in hot oil before your eyes Planning tip Most food stalls only open in the evening so arrive after for the best selection Watch polo at the Shandur Top The Shandur Pass feels like the top of the world and at above sea level it is Itâ s also the location for Pakistanâ s most fiercely fought polo tournament â teams from Chitral and Gilgit compete under freestyle rules during the annual Shandur Polo Festival in early July with as many as spectators watching on Join them for a unique Pakistan experience Planning tip Allow plenty of time to acclimatize to the altitude at Shandur Top so you can enjoy the festival without dizziness or gasping for breath Spend time with the Kalash in Chitral

celebrations Chawmos straddles the Winter Solstice and includes music dance and the ritual purification of attendees Crossing the Hussaini Hanging Bridge is one of the most exciting experiences in Pakistan Â Wu Swee Ong Getty Images Brave the hanging bridges of Gilgit Baltistan Dangling above gushing rivers in Gilgit Baltistan in the north of Pakistan are a succession of precarious looking bridges made from wooden slats crudely lashed together with rope If youâ re hunting for fun things to do in Pakistan and you donâ t have a fear of heights this is the activity for you If hanging bridges are not enough of an adrenaline rush you can also cross several of the rivers on rudimentary zip lines Advertisement Detour Combine a trip to the Hussaini Hanging Bridge in Gojal with a visit to the beautiful mountain valley of Hunza often described as the original Shangri La Discover the Bronze Age history of Pakistan at Moenjodaro The Indus Valley Civilisation gave birth to one of the worldâ s first cities Moenjodaro in around BCE This remarkable archaeological site was not rediscovered until the and itâ s now a Unesco World Heritage Site You can clearly see the planned layout of the city â a tidy grid of streets lined with residential and administrative buildings plus a substantial citadel guard towers more than wells and public baths These early inhabitants knew how to live life well Planning tip Moenjodaro is on the banks of the River Indus near Larkana â visit in the afternoon and you can also take an evening boat ride on a flat bottomed boat See the rock cut Buddha of Swat Before the arrival of Islam Pakistan had a substantial Buddhist population â Buddhism flourished under the Kushan Empire and in the Swat Valley you can find not only temples and stupas but also relief carvings of the Buddha The century Buddha of Swat near Mingora was attacked by the Taliban in but has since been restored and once again sits smiling serenely in the lotus position Planning tip Ask about the security situation before heading to Swat â there are occasional flare ups in the area Learn about Sufism in Multan Multan is known as the â City of Saintsâ because of the large number of Sufi mystics who lived here in the and centuries Their tombs are architectural marvels but far more intriguing is the saintsâ ongoing cultural legacy including their influence on Pakistani poetry music and dance Listening to the sounds of qawwalis devotional songs echoing around the walls of Multanâ s shrines is a spine tingling moment of magic Planning tip Check the dates of the annual Urs festival at the Tomb of Shah Rukn e Alam and try to avoid this busy time more than pilgrims attend so Multan becomes very crowded Enjoy the evening light over Lahore s Badshahi Mosque Â Getty Images Observe the sunset over the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore There are so many things to do in Lahore that it can be quite overwhelming so block out an hour or two at dusk to watch the sunset at the century Badshahi Mosque Built by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb itâ s a masterpiece of Indo Islamic architecture and the pink sandstone facade and white marble domes look particularly impressive in the evening light The mosque stays open for visitors until around Planning tip For an alternative view of the mosque head up to the rooftop of Coocoâ s Den a traditional haveli restored by artist Iqbal Hussain Immerse yourself in cultural heritage at the Lok Virsa Museum in Islamabad Islamabadâ s Lok Virsa Museum is the largest museum in Pakistan and is dedicated to the countryâ s culture past and present It rates as one of Pakistanâ s top sights partly because it brings together the living traditions of all Pakistanâ s ethnic groups in one location The displays of sculpture textiles jewelry and woodwork attest to the skills of centuries of artisans and thereâ s a huge archive of audio and video recordings too Shop from street stalls at Rawalpindiâ s Raja Bazaar A market is a window into the soul of a country and Rawalpindi â s famous Raja Bazaar is the perfect place for people watching If you want to understand more about Pakistan spend a morning at Raja Bazaar shopping for second hand books costume jewelry and other interesting local souvenirs You can refresh yourself with freshly squeezed juices and deep fried snacks while you browse Ride the bus to the hill station of Murree Built by the British in the this glorious hill station was the summer retreat for the colonial government Buildings like the Holy Trinity Church and the General Post Office are architectural reminders of the Raj but more recent additions such as the gondola and chair lifts delight a new generation of mostly domestic tourists and offer fabulous views Ride to Murree from Rawalpindi on a colorful local bus and the journey will be as memorable as the destination Planning tip For the best views in Murree head to lofty Kashmir Point around a kilometer from the post office along Mall Road One of the best experiences in Pakistan is driving the Karakoram Highway Â Shehzaad Maroof Getty Images Drive the Karakoram Highway from Islamabad to the Khunjerab Pass Without a doubt the Karakoram Highway is one of the worldâ s greatest road trips Spanning miles the road officially starts in Hasan Abdal in southern Pakistan and finishes at Kashgar in China but itâ s the section between Islamabad and the China Pakistan border which has the most dramatic scenery Although a few crazy cyclists and motorbikers tackle the route independently itâ s much more popular to travel by shared or chartered or local bus You can admire the peaks of Nanga Parbat and Rakaposhi along the way Planning tip The Khunjerab Pass is closed to all vehicles from December to April due to icy conditions so keep this in mind if youâ re traveling on to China Hike to the Fairy Meadows With mountains dominating the northern part of the country hiking is definitely one of the best things to do in Pakistan Thereâ s no road to the scenic Fairy Meadows but in late spring and early autumn you can take a to Tatu village and continue for three to four hours on foot You wonâ t find fairies at Fairy Meadows but the scenery feels magical nevertheless and as the best accommodation option is camping youâ ve got all night to enjoy some unparalleled star gazing Detour If youâ re feeling ambitious follow up a trip to Fairy Meadows with a trek to Nanga Parbat Base Camp Pay your respects to Jinnah at the Quaid i Azam in Karachi Muhammad Ali Jinnah is considered to be the father of Pakistan and was the countryâ s first governor general His white marble tomb in Karachi was designed in the in a modernist style but architect Yahya Merchant also took inspiration from the century Ismail Samani Mausoleum in Bukhara
