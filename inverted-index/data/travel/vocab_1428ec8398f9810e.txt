Northern Minnesota Road Trip National Geographic A hiker pauses along the craggy North Shore of Lake Superior Photograph by Susan Dykstra Getty Images TRAVEL Road Trip Northern Minnesota From the August September issue of National Geographic Traveler By Berit Thorkelson June min read The roar of America s Jazz Age echoed in the Minnesota wilderness At a time when anything seemed possible why not an exclusive club for the nation s elite up where the rugged North Woods and mammoth Lake Superior collide A group of Minnesota businessmen put plans in place for such a resort which they named Naniboujou for the Cree Indian god of the woods Some potential members including heavyweight boxing champ Jack Dempsey and slugger Babe Ruth signed on seduced by visions of an opulent lodge bathhouse golf course and tennis courts on acres blessed with birches like Greek columns and cedars like Gothic pillars The Great Depression quashed this outdoorsman s dream and only the lodge was built Still years after its conception the inn survives its riches unchanged from the doomed club s prospectus the rustle of the pines the brawling and babbling of the stream the muffled murmur of the breakers on the beach Extreme nature dominates northeastern Minnesota setting the scene for a drive combining coast and forest small town character and deep woods seclusion Road trips up the Minnesota shore of Lake Superior begin in Duluth an industrial harbor town at the southern end of a wooded triangle called the Arrowhead and two lane Highway Also called North Shore Scenic Drive the paved boundary between woods and waters delivers views of the ancient volcanic basalt cliffs that plunge into Lake Superior so vast it merges with the sky on the horizon At the turn of the century outbound ships loaded with northern Minnesota s prized iron ore ranked Duluth among the U S s busiest ports Life here is still trained on the water One of the many pleasures of living in Duluth is that you have to look at the lake a lot writes author and resident Barton Sutter in his book Cold Comfort Life at the Top of the Map You might only mean to get some groceries but on your way you see something so grand so terrible and beautiful that you absorb your daily requirement of humility just by driving down the street Canal Park a onetime warehouse district is now filled with lakeside restaurants shops hotels and historical attractions On board the S S William A Irvin a foot retired ore and coal ship tour goers explore everything from the engine room s brass controls to the sophisticated wood trimmed visitors quarters Working ships still dock here too about a thousand vessels annually more than any other Great Lakes port lending authenticity with their massive slow moving presence as they request passage under the Aerial Lift Bridge on occasion still letting out deep vibrating honks long short long short Interaction between boats and bridge complements the Lake Superior Maritime Visitors Center near the bridge s foot About miles up the road on the east edge of Two Harbors a faux log cabin beckons from the side of the road as it has for the past four decades One of a handful of smoked fish purveyors along the shore Lou s Fish House expertly prepares Lake Superior trout brined in teriyaki cured in brown sugar or worked into a spread Then it s on to Gooseberry Falls State Park the first of eight state parks that line the mile long stretch between Duluth and Canada More than half a million annual visitors stop to absorb the thunderous misting cascades along Gooseberry s namesake river one of many that tumble out of the forest and into Lake Superior A few more minutes on the road brings drivers to Split Rock Lighthouse State Park acres edged with steep shoreline trails Among them stands the black capped Split Rock Lighthouse a beautiful beacon born of tragedy In Congress commissioned the lighthouse atop a story hunk of gray cliff after one of the notorious November gales damaged ships two of which crashed onto the rocky shore Navigational tools rendered Split Rock obsolete decades ago but visitors poke around the keepers quarters and climb the lighthouse tower both outfitted as if operating during their glory days About miles shy of Canada is Grand Marais which was once an trading post and fishing village Current residents of the one stoplight town of tend to be creative types and outdoor enthusiasts some who lead dog mushing and canoeing trips Living at the end of the road helps you take every day for what it s worth Nature s at

three million acre Superior National Forest This remote region grabbed national headlines last August when high winds shifted a small naturally occurring fire into a voracious blaze producing smoke that traveled as far away as Russia The largest the forest had weathered in more than a century the fire burned into October and scorched a acre scar into the Arrowhead One year later the episode is just another chapter in the land s rough and tumble tale Fires are part of life up here says Sue Kerfoot who has lived in the area since the and runs Gunflint Lodge with her husband The Arrowhead s Canadian edge is laced with the daisy chained lakes and lanky pines of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness over a million motor free acres that look as they did when American Indians and French
