Where to eat and drink in Vilnius Lithuania Vilnius Old Town is home to some of the city s best restaurants and bars Photograph by Robert Harding Alamy Stock Photo TRAVEL best places to eat and drink in Vilnius Lithuania A foraged bounty from nearby forests and rivers provides rich pickings for adventurous travellers to the Lithuanian capital By Ben Olsen November This article was produced by National Geographic Traveller UK Amandus Fine dining favourite In the east of Vilnius s beautiful baroque Old Town an iron bridge over the Vilnia river marks the border with Užipis This once down at heel district turned artist enclave declared itself an independent republic in complete with unofficial president currency and manifesto Gentrification in the years since has smoothed its counter cultural edges but among the galleries and boutiques unconventional thinking still has its place I climb the hill passing the Angel of Užipis statue towards a cosy warm lit glow that reveals the entrance to Amandus the fine dining restaurant of chef patron Deivydas Praspaliauskas which opened in From the Scandi minimal dining room I watch a team of chefs busying themselves ahead of service in the open kitchen With just one sitting at and no menu in sight there s a palpable sense of anticipation ahead of a course journey led by a chef who has done much to drive the city s food culture It s been a rapid ascent for Praspaliauskas who after leaving Vilnius for Denmark at rose from the bottom rung of the restaurant ladder to heights that included a brief stint at Noma During this period he was encouraged to return home and enter a competition to find Lithuania s best chef which he won age just giving him the impetus to open his own restaurant in At that time Vilnius had little beyond pasta pizza and a couple of hotel restaurants he says of the city s limited dining scene following the Soviet occupation which ended in My first newspaper review said We give this guy three months because of those tiny portions and lunches Three months on and the reviewer wrote I was wrong and you need to book a table for that lunch That for me was a sign something was happening Today the fine dining landscape has changed In four city restaurants gained Michelin stars Amandus not yet among them A succession of dishes soon emerge from the kitchen accompanied by flourishes with pipettes or liquid nitrogen Tender caramelised root vegetables offset smoked catfish cognac accented chicken liver tops dark rye and a Praspaliauskas calling card beetroot bread with notes of liquorice While he s no slave to traditional Lithuanian dishes or domestic produce Praspaliauskas s cooking celebrates his heritage through star ingredients including foraged mushrooms and berries from the forest and techniques such as smoking and pickling People often ask about Lithuanian food and the one thing that would see our culture collapse is if you took away soup Even if you don t order soup you get soup he says Here it appears in various forms from creamy potato foam concealing pickled cauliflower to a chicken broth thickened with barley and adorned with plump pink quail breast Throughout Praspaliauskas s skill lies in his ability to draw out the essence of everyday ingredients On any plate I hope you find distinct flavours that are as pure as possible he says of a style that s drawn comparisons with New Nordic cuisine It took me a while to understand whether what I do is Scandinavian or Baltic But ultimately we need to create our own story Halės Turgus Delis DJs The grand old clock above the entrance to Halės Turgus indoor market shows as I wander past a throng of elderly ladies setting up baskets of foraged boletus mushrooms on the steps To the south of the Old Town on the mural daubed fringe of the Station District this lofty landmark has been the city s biggest trading post for more than a century and today its mix of cafes bars and food stalls is a charismatic clash of tradition and modernity Between an abundance of stalls stacked with staples including juniper smoked pork knuckles pigs ears and salamis I meet the mother and daughter duo behind new wave cheesemonger Roots who between serving customers kefir and cottage cheese slice me samples of their artisanal bestsellers waxy caraway studded kmynukas and džiugas a hard aged cheese sitting somewhere between gouda and parmesan Onwards past mountains of cranberries and pickled cucumbers a growing queue for the oven fresh wares at Beigelistai bakery embodies the revival of Vilnius s Jewish heritage all but erased during the Second World War Nods to Lithuania s globalising tastes meanwhile quickly become apparent At Halės Smokehouse which specialises in American style barbecue team member Kostas pours me a satisfyingly malty glass of gira the carbonated Baltic drink made from fermented rye bread which he describes as Lithuanian Coca Cola After the Soviets left capitalism began and all these strange new products from overseas started to arrive he says as he shows me through the sleek modern butchery and into a rear hall heaving with apparel aftershaves and adapter plugs After dark the scene here shifts and DJs play techno as a handful of bars serve amaro cocktails to a boisterous crowd Stallholders sometimes turn up the following morning with the party still going strong There s a real community spirit and the best part is that you ve got all the traditional stuff as well as people trying something new says Kostas adding that while the market is becoming popular with tourists it s still full of locals A constant through German and Soviet occupation as well as two declarations of Lithuanian independence Halės Turgus remains a reliable barometer for the city s evolving tastes Lokys menu delves deep into Lithuanian tradition by serving medieval classics such as beaver stew and roasted boar Photograph by Lokys Dūmu Fabrikas The new wave brewery Life in Lithuania is said to revolve around three Bs beer bread and basketball While the latter is labelled the country s second religion the former has its roots in a proud pagan tradition Lithuania only converted to Christianity in the century but evidence of its Romuva past includes a shrine to Ragutis the Baltic god of beer on Pilies Street a nod to a brewing culture that dates back to the fifth century Ragutis would likely approve of what s brewing in Naujoji Vilnia New Vilnius a former industrial district flanking the river just minutes by train from the Old Town Here surrounded by dense pine forest family owned Sakiškės Brewery has set up shop at Dūmu Fabrikas a former factory It s in this expansive hall which doubles as a venue for live events that I meet Gintaras Bingelis from the Sakiškės Brewery team Gesturing at the taps that line the sleek bar he explains what s driven a passion project that began in What we do is so called modern beer taking traditional styles and making new recipes he says from our mezzanine level vantage point overlooking the brewery s fermentation tanks We aim to produce two new styles of beer every month Among the standouts I sample an excellent IPA hazy hoppy and sour and a coffee and chocolate accented imperial stout Two more unconventional beers shaped by local ingredients arrive in the form of an earthy beetroot ale and a pilsner flavoured with pinecones whose fragrant notes pair well with slices of smoked sausage from a platter of accompanying cheeses and charcuterie Although of beer consumption in Lithuania is lager craft beer is becoming more popular and younger generations are moving to fruitier styles says Gintaras Sakiškės Brewery produces litres per month and its beers can be found in many of the city s pubs including Užipis s excellent dive bar Spunka Taproom tastings meanwhile are helping more people discover artisanal alternatives to mass produced lagers With evangelists like Gintaras Lithuania s love affair with beer should only grow stronger Lokys Medieval menu Beaver stew isn t often found on menus in Vilnius Lokys team insists In the vaulted cellar of this flamboyant family restaurant waitress Jurgita explains the historical approach to cooking Many places that sell traditional Lithuanian food focus on potatoes pancakes dumplings or kugelis potato casserole but potatoes only became popular about years ago so we decided to look further back A deep dive through diaries memoirs and recipe books from the medieval noble classes when Lithuania was a Grand Duchy helped shape Lokys dishes Its menu of wild meats and foraged foods doubles as a history lesson We begin with beer snacks fried rye bread smoked strips of pig s ear zingy pickles and aged cheeses with sea buckthorn jam It was the Karaims Turkic speaking Jews from Crimea who arrived at the behest of century ruler Vytautas the Great who brought cucumbers cabbages and preservation techniques to the country Jurgita tells me Next I feast on roasted boar beloved of the city s founder Grand Duke Gediminas topped with a berry jus that cuts through the tender fatty meat Jurgita explains that the Milan born Grand Duchess Bona Sforza is to thank for the healthier menu items with the former first lady having introduced basil tomato and garlic from her native Italy in the century She tried to introduce more greens to the diet of a population that largely ate meat And so to the braised beaver After the Christianisation of the country in the century Lithuania s love of pork was put to the test during Lent when the consumption of meat was forbidden So Jurgita says beaver a skilled swimmer with a scaly tail would be classed as a fish and thus this furry critter became a Friday night staple Gamey in flavour with a rather tough texture even after a lengthy period of slow cooking there s a reason many Lithuanians switched to more palatable proteins when rules loosened But as I finish with a sip of Krupnikas honey liqueur I can t help but be impressed by Lokys staunch commitment to its mission Published in Issue autumn of Food by National Geographic Traveller UK To subscribe to National Geographic Traveller UK magazine
