Louis Apr min read Share The Rota Vicentina Getty Images iStockphoto Although temperatures vary from month to month the Algarve gets reliable sunshine days a year and with the obvious natural beauty of its cliff backed golden beaches this region in southern Portugal draws big crowds to one of the loveliest stretches of sand in Europe Summertime sees the biggest influx of visitors for sunbathing plus surfing kayaking and other water sports Winter feels like an entirely different affair but plenty of activities are on offer no matter when you visit Advertisement Until recently many resort towns in the Algarve virtually closed up for the winter with limited options for lodging dining and tours That has changed in the past few years as the Algarve s top spots have begun to refashion themselves as year round destinations Nevertheless some places still close for the season so keep that in mind when making your plans Here s our guide to the best times to come to the Algarve Praia do Camilo Marco Bottigelli Getty Images June to August is the best time for perfect weather The region sizzles during high season encouraging days of lounging on the beach followed by refreshing dips in the ocean cold Atlantic currents mean that the sea never gets quite as warm as the Mediterranean Thereâ s also very little rainfall and skies are virtually cloud free during the height of summer Festival season kicks off in June and the whole region joins the party at events like MED in LoulÃ In July and August â the Algarveâ s hottest months â the average temperature is around C F though some days can get as hot as C F With cool ocean breezes evening temperatures hover around C F which is just about perfect for outdoor dining Music festivals on the beaches attract a surge of visitors in July Afro Nation Portugal brings the party to PortimÃ o and the incredible spectacle of the candlelit Mercado de Culturas festival lights up Lagoa Advertisement The high August temps practically demand a dip in the cool Atlantic waters It s also a great month to spot dolphins on a boat excursion Mingle with locals at PortimÃ o s street food fest and OlhÃ o s seafood festival to appreciate some of the delicious local cuisine Naturally the inviting beach conditions coincide with heaviest season for tourism Hotel prices are at their highest and the crowds hit their peak If you plan to visit at this time youâ ll need to plan well in advance Expect to pay a premium when it comes to accommodations Youâ ll also have to share those pretty sands with plenty of other travelers â though you can still find quieter beaches if you move away from busy tourist centers like Albufeira and Lagos The coast near Sagres Umomos Shutterstock April to May and September to October are the times for outdoor adventures The spring months from April to May and the autumn months from mid September to October are the best times to visit if youâ re interested in hiking horseback riding mountain biking and other land based activities The days are still warm and sunny though there s a small chance of sparse drizzle and the temperatures rarely get so hot as to be uncomfortable Easter typically marks the end of the low season in the Algarve with the first signs of life emerging in the region s slumbering seaside towns Easter processions add excitement as does Liberation Day April when you can see fireworks and parades in some of Portugal s prettiest villages April and May are also good months to spot wildflowers on the hillsides in the fields and around the coastal areas Whether you re heading on a long hike such as the mile Via Algarviana or simply going for a walk in the afternoon the sunny rain free month of May is a great time to be out and about Day parties and dance workshops come to Albufeira during the Kizomba Open Summer Festival â don t miss the opportunity to dance until dawn with an impressive roster of international artists Water temperatures in September arenâ t much different than in August but cooler air makes for enjoyable beach days You ll see fewer crowds than during the previous month Practice your best strut beneath the sun at the Festival Flamenco in Lagos Birdwatchers flock to the Algarve in October to witness winged beauties passing through en route to Africa during the annual autumn migration This is also an excellent month for outdoor activities as youâ ll get a welcome break from the summer heat Youâ ll find noticeably lighter crowds during these shoulder seasons and you can save as much as on lodging rates compared to the high season OlhÃ o Shutterstock Mauro Rodrigues November to March is the best time for budget travelers The Algarve feels like a different place if you visit in the low season There are fewer crowds and you ll hear much more Portuguese spoken everywhere you go Temperatures drop but the days are still quite pleasant with average highs of around C F even during the coldest weeks in January and February Though most of the Algarveâ s annual rainfall comes during the winter the showers tend to be short and youâ ll likely see a fair number of sunny days As the days grow shorter in December nighttime temperatures are brisk but days are mild with highs around C F In the buildup to Christmas many towns have special markets and display life size nativity scenes Vila Real de Santo has one of Portugalâ s biggest tableaus The Algarveâ s cultural calendar in January fills with art exhibitions dance and theater performances and film screenings Faro PortimÃ o Lagos LoulÃ and Albufeira have the most going on along with Tavira and Silves On chilly February nights locals nestle inside to catch live music and dance performances in key cities With the general absence of tourists days are fairly quiet at seaside towns except during Carnaval s parades and revelry in the streets With pleasant temperatures the early days of spring in March bring longer days and the first blooms to the hillsides around the region Low season in the Algarve is still a great time to be outdoors though picture yourself taking long walks on the seaside without crowds â but with a light jacket handy â rather than swimming in the ocean Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Plan with a local Experience the real Portugal Let a local expert craft your dream trip Get started For Explorers Everywhere Follow us SUBSCRIBE Get off
