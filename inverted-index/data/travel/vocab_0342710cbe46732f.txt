in Alberta and Vancouver in British Columbia are the key international gateway cities to the Canadian Rocky Mountains which sit astride the two provinces For an instant hit of big country vistas start in Calgary and drive west and you ll be in the deep Rockies within minutes That wow moment takes much longer from Vancouver or Edmonton Alberta s other gateway city The classic trip Start in Alberta s capital Edmonton and allow time to visit River Valley Canada s largest urban park Heading west the drive to the mountains takes about three hours as you transition from the prairies to the foothills and finally enter Jasper National Park Spend two nights in the area you ll see wildlife throughout most of the year Jasper has half as many hotels as Banff so book ahead and shop around for deals Next drive south on Highway to Banff National Park taking in the Columbia Icefields Stay two nights in the Banff Lake Louise area and then continue south on Highway through Kootenay National Park Stay a night in Radium Hot Springs take a dip in the pools before continuing south for spectacular views at Crowsnest Pass and Waterton Lakes National Park From Waterton it s a nice three hour drive to Calgary but I recommend stopping at UNESCO Heritage site Head Smashed in Buffalo Jump an Indigenous mass hunting site where bison were driven off the cliff Then backtrack to Highway for panoramic views at Highwood Pass the highest in Canada The county s first national park Banff is a popular stop on a road trip from Edmonton Alberta s capital city Photograph by Mark Unrau Located in Yoho

miss Three Sisters a spectacular trio of mountains near Canmore and visit Canmore Nordic Centre a hub for cross country skiing at the Winter Olympics also great for mountain biking As a base Canmore
