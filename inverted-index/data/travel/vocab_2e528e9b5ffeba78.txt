Rome promises a memorable trip for the whole family Â JupiterImages Getty Images With its mighty monuments creepy catacombs and glorious food Rome is a magical place for kids Romans like all Italians love children and with a little imagination youâ ll find thereâ s plenty to keep your little ones entertained among the cityâ s tumbledown ruins and ancient streets Is Rome good for kids Your children will love roaming around Rome Child specific attractions might be thin on the ground but tales of gladiators and heroic deeds can transform historical sights into fantastical playgrounds Technology also helps and several sites provide smartphone apps and interactive displays even VR headsets Advertisement Away from the headline attractions there are parks to explore and underground treasures to discover And then thereâ s the food Gelato and sliced pizza make perfect snacks while restaurants are pretty relaxed about accommodating young diners Few have kids menus but most will happily serve a mezza porzione childâ s portion But itâ s not always so easy going Cobbled streets and out of order metro lifts can make life tough with a stroller Similarly there are few nappy changing facilities and public toilets are rare Enjoying real Italian gelato near Gelateria in Rome Â TravnikovStudio Shutterstock Where is best in Rome for kids The centro storico and ancient heart harbor many top sights as well as countless gelaterie and pizza takeaways Villa Borghese is another top spot home to the city zoo a small boating lake and plenty of picnic spots In the Vatican you can climb St Peterâ

displays a fire engine and free play park Your nippers will love it Advertisement Best things to do in Rome with kids Relive past glories at the Colosseum Everyone wants to see the Colosseum and it doesnâ t disappoint especially if prefaced by tales of mortal combat and ferocious lions To see where the lions were caged consider a tour of the hypogeum the network of underground corridors that extends beneath the main arena Close up of kids throwing coins into Trevi Fountain in Rome Â Imgorthand Getty Images Toss a coin into the Trevi Fountain The Trevi Fountain is the one place youâ ll encourage your kids to throw their money away Tradition dictates that if you toss a coin into the fountain youâ ll return to the Eternal City To secure your comeback join the crowds â which lessen after dark â and chuck in your pennies Summit St Peterâ s in the Vatican Youâ ll almost certainly pass through the Vatican at some point and while itâ s not made for kids it can be fun Toddlers can chase pigeons around St Peterâ s Square and stare at the Swiss Guardsâ snazzy uniforms Their older siblings might enjoy climbing St Peterâ s dome and admiring the stunning rooftop views Similarly dramatic panoramas await at the nearby Castel Santâ Angelo Tell a lie at the Bocca della VeritÃ Itâ s said that if you tell a lie with your hand in the Bocca della VeritÃ â an ancient marble disc with a face carved into it â the mouth will slam shut and bite off your mitt Try it then decamp to the nearby Circo Massimo for a run around and picnic Tech at the Terme di Caracalla If your kids love technology try them with the augmented reality headsets at the Terme di Caracalla These VR guides recreate the vast baths complex as it looked in its century heyday Multimedia displays are also used

Terrazza delle Quadrighe To get there take the lift on the structureâ s western flank Rent bicycles to explore further afield on the Via Appia in Rome Â Jannis Werner Getty Images Catacombs on the Appian Way Via Appia Antica is home to Romeâ s best known catacombs These underground tunnels are where the early Christians buried their dead and itâ s a wonderfully creepy experience to poke around their hidden depths On returning to the land of the living clear your head with a bike ride along Via Appia Go to gladiator school Give free rein to your inner Spartacus at Romeâ s gladiator school Here you and your young warriors can dress up in traditional garb and learn gladiatorial combat under the watchful eyes of instructors from the Gruppo Storico Romano Footie at the Stadio Olimpico For an unforgettable sporting experience take your teens to a match at the Stadio Olimpico Hardcore fans fill the Curva Nord Lazio or Curva Sud Roma but for a more family friendly experience try the central tribune sections If you canâ t make a game stadium tours are also available Planning tips Roman hotels tend to have small rooms but many have at least one set up for families Book early to secure your choice Public transport is free for under but youâ ll still be walking a lot A carrier will help if youâ re traveling with a baby while for toddlers a robust stroller is a must For long
