influences are evident everywhere in its cuisine Paprika pops up on menus all over the country along with dishes like goulash and a pepper and tomato stew Similar to its Hungarian counterpart which is made with beef onions and garlic Slovak goulash includes potatoes carrots and other root vegetables often served with knedle bread dumplings Some chefs add grated apple for enriched flavor and texture While paprika is prominent in the Hungarian version Slovak goulash is complemented by caraway seeds marjoram and other spices Local wine TokajskÃ AszÃº balances the richness of goulash with its acidity and sweetness a delightful combination indeed Where to try it Treat yourself to a plate full to the brim at Restaurant Klapka in the historic Zichy Palace in KomÃ rno If itâ s the season for wild boar and deer goulash get yourself a table at Hubert Varga in the historic center just from the Danube and the nearby thermal spa A hearty sauerkraut and sausage soup kapustnica always satisfies Veronika Kovalenko Shutterstock Warm up with kapustnica in the High Tatras In northern Slovakia the mountainous terrain shapes a cuisine centered on hearty warming foods perfect for cold climates In the High Tatras local ingredients like forest mushrooms and berries are staples with game meats such as venison and wild boar also popular Dairy products especially from sheep are also common Kapustnica sauerkraut soup is a winter favorite This robust dish features tangy sauerkraut and a mix of meats like pork and sausage and sometimes smoked ham or bacon for added depth Made with onions garlic and paprika the broth is rich and flavorful Dried mushrooms add an earthy note while potatoes provide a comforting starchy touch Seasoned with bay leaves black pepper and caraway seeds kapustnica is warm aromatic and deeply satisfying â and often tastes even better the day after as the flavors continue to meld Where to try it Visit Koliba Tatry in Nova Lesna for a wide selection of local dishes including kapustnica Another must try is the sauerkraut soup at Koliba Patria in Å trbskÃ Pleso where the authentic flavors and quality ingredients impress At ECK Restaurant in DevÃ n Slovak cuisine â here a blend of Savoy cabbage celeriac and apple â gets the haute treatment ECK Fermenting foods turns tradition into trend Pickling and fermenting especially of sauerkraut play a vital role in Slovak cuisine This traditional approach took root due to the historic necessity of preserving food and minimizing waste Today the tradition is once again growing in popularity thanks to fermented foodâ s health benefits and the rich depth of flavors the technique imparts In Slovak culinary tradition fermented and preserved foods develop unique complex flavors that fresh ingredients simply donâ t deliver These tastes are fundamental in dishes like kyslÃ polievka a sour soup made from fermented wheat or barley Today a new generation of Slovak chefs is reinvigorating this practice by creatively integrating fermentation into modern cuisine Theyâ re experimenting by fermenting new ingredients such as garlic carrots and radishes resulting in sauces and dressings with intriguing flavor profiles Beyond savory dishes chefs are adding fermented ingredients to cocktails and beverages too creating unique â and uniquely Slovak â concoctions Fermented elements also enhance desserts adding subtle and complex accents to sweet preparations Where to try it At ECK Restaurant in DevÃ n a town many visit for its storied castle pickled autumn pears accompany white chocolate mousse infused with milk juniper berries and walnuts â an ingenious mix of heritage and innovation To accompany the seven course tasting menu choose a subtly sparkling delicately acidic fermented black tea drink macerated with fruits and herbs Expect intricate flavors akin to those found in fine wine With a little creativity itâ s possible for vegetarians and vegans to enjoy traditional Slovak fare Soloviova Liudmyla Shutterstock Vegetarians and vegans In larger cities like Bratislava and KoÅ ice Slovakiaâ s eastern second city vegetarian and vegan restaurants are on the rise with many conventional spots now offering options as well In rural areas however plant based eaters many find things more challenging Still though Slovak cuisine is famously meat and dairy heavy vegetarians and vegans can still enjoy the countryâ s bounty with a bit of creativity For example bryndzovÃ haluÅ ky can be prepared without bacon or sausage and vegans can use plant based cheese instead of bryndza The lard or butter that typically accompanies lokshe potato flatbreads can be substituted for vegetable oil or vegan spreads Such dishes pair wonderfully with traditional and traditionally vegan Å alÃ
