Lawton Nov min read Share Greetings from Bermuda Georgina Lawton journalist and author of â Black Girls Take Worldâ shares her favorite spots from a recent trip to the island of Bermuda Bermuda was a place that prior to this trip felt like an elusive and exclusive fantasy location to me a dream like island of pink sands and crystalline waters that seemed filtered Then a college friend moved to Bermuda for work recently and suddenly a trip was within my reach I could finally see if the island was as beautiful as I had imagined I visited in mid October when the weather was still around and the tourist crowds had largely eased Advertisement Georgina tries a fried fish sandwich at Cafe Ole I usually start the day in Bermuda withâ Bermudaâ s fish sandwich â an island staple After a comfortable mid morning flight with Jetblue from New York City I made it my mission to hunt down the best fish sandwich on the island for brunch I was looking for a local catch that was floured and fried and served on thick bread layered with tomatoes and tartar sauce Locals pointed me toward CafÃ OlÃ in Hamilton where I found exactly what I was looking for The cafeâ s take on the fish sandwich is door stopper sized packed full of breaded rockfish and served in mild flavored raisin bread Totally mouth watering and incredibly filling Taste the best of Bermudaâ s food and drink flavors that you shouldnâ t miss Georgina behind the wheel of a Twizzy In Bermuda you must tryâ Renting a Twizzy an electric mini car With just two seats set tandem style inside a four foot wide vehicle getting in and out of a Twizzy can feel a bit awkward but once youâ re inside itâ s a pretty enjoyable and surprisingly smooth ride Pay as you go or pay a flat rate of about to keep the car for the whole day Advertisement My friend and I used it to whizz between the main beaches â and received several waves from other drivers doing the same thing Parking and electric charging points for Twizzy cars are easy to come by Sushi and cocktails at Pearl The top spot for dinner and drinks in Bermuda is Pearl a sushi restaurant in Hamilton With terrace views of Hamilton harbor Japanese trained chefs and an extensive sake menu Pearl feels like an occasion a fabulous date spot or special place to treat a friend Fresh fish is everywhere in Bermuda and at Pearl it comes in the form of creatively prepared sushi packed full of flavor The sashimi practically melts in the mouth If youâ re craving maki rolls try the crispy Kotzu Pearl which contains lobster crab avocado and spicy mayo The best times to visit Bermuda from cheap winter breaks to summer sun Relaxing in the pool at The Loren In Bermuda I stayed in The Loren at Pink Beach a five star boutique hotel Built along a hillside on Bermudaâ s southeast coast the incredibly stylish rooms at The Loren come with views of the Atlantic A marine themed restaurant at the hotel serves everything from crab cakes for breakfast to Bermudian fish and chips Thereâ s also an onsite gym and gorgeous infinity pool for when you finally manage to peel yourself from that sunlounger and a direct access private pink hued beach Even though itâ s fancy and considered the â itâ place to stay in Bermuda the service is friendly and never feels stuffy I recommend booking a Phyto Aromatic Zen Harmony massage at the hotelâ s spa probably one of the best massages Iâ ve ever had â firm but relaxing Getting away from the crowds at Cooperâ s Island Nature Reserve In Bermuda I got away from the crowds byâ Sunbathing at Cooperâ s Island Nature Reserve You might have heard of Horseshoe Bay a popular beach that attracts a steady stream of visitors year round but my pick for a relaxing beach day is Cooperâ s Island I found it incredibly calm and dazzlingly beautiful home to pristine sands that are almost pink unspoiled walks with rocky coves and turquoise water that you don t have to share with crowds of people things to do in Bermuda in between beach days Bringing the taste of Bermuda back home with Outerbridgeâ s sherry pepper sauce From Bermuda you should bring backâ Outerbridgeâ s Original sherry pepper sauce This is essentially the taste of Bermuda bottled This dark brown sauce is as piquant as a shot of alcohol In Bermuda it s often used as an added kick in local cocktails and to season soups meats and stews Georgina Lawton
