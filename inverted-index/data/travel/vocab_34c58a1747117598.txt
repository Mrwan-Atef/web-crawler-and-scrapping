Cathedral dominates the skyline in Tallinn kavalenkava Shutterstock Despite their geographical proximity the cultures of the countries of the Baltic States are worlds apart Lithuania the last country in Europe to adopt Christianity is packed with pagan history Latvia has incredible landscapes and many cultural layers Estonia with influences from nearby Finland is known for its economic success This road trip route starts in Vilnius and ends in the historic city of Tallinn covering over Each stage of driving takes around two to three hours We recommend allowing two weeks to complete the

of Lithuania and Gediminas Castle a series of settlements dating back to Neolithic times Advertisement Spend a few quiet hours in the quarter of Nowhere is the cityâ s thriving spirit more evident that in this bohemian neighbourhood It was here that a group of creative individuals jokingly decided to proclaim their independence going as far as to draw up a mock constitution for their republic The Lithuanian government has since gone along with the joke allowing to remain independent although the status is in name alone From Vilnius make a brief stop away in Kaunas Lithuaniaâ s second largest city and European Capital of Culture for Kaunas Castle offers an insight into the countryâ s past and the Museum of Devils which is packed with masks and stories outlines local traditions and folklore Drive onwards to KlaipÄ da which has a quiet and unassuming beauty that will immediately make an impression on you An important point on several trading routes this is one of the many Baltic cities that bears the mark of European merchants especially those of German and Dutch descent From here take a ferry to the Curonian Spit which separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea This bewitching national park and Unesco Heritage Site is made up of sand dunes pine forests and fishing villages It can be visited as a day trip but if you re keen to explore in depth allow three days here The coastal city of Palanga is roughly a drive from KlaipÄ da Itâ s a popular destination for a day at the beach on the Baltic Sea so expect the pier and cosy streets to be flooded with people Advertisement A cobbled street in RÄ ga s Old Town Eduardo Arraes Getty Images Latvia Ventspils and RÄ ga From Palanga cross the border into Latvia heading towards Ventspils nearly away Itâ s a classy

Alexander Nevsky Cathedral an onion domed Russian Orthodox cathedral to admire the frescoes For a taste of traditional rural life drive out to Estonia Open Air Museum where you can visit historic

Tallinnâ s shore a trip you can make in a day if you book tickets in advance Tallinn by the seasons a year round guide to Estoniaâ s capital Make it happen driving info Roads in the Baltic States are for the most part very well maintained Traffic jams are infrequent especially outside of the main cities Be sure to drive on the right There are plenty of parking spaces in the cities at both private car parks and meters Expect to pay more for parking at meters that are closer to the city centre Four scenic drives in the Balkans Contributor Eduard Banulescu Advertisement Advertisement
