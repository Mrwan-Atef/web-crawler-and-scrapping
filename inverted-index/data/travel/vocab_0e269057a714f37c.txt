Bjarnason Jun min read Share Getting around central ReykjavÃ k is easy on foot or by bus electric scooter or bike Â Andrij Vatsyk Shutterstock ReykjavÃ k has a population of just people but the Icelandic capital spans an area double the size of Paris To get around locals use the automobile like an expensive overcoat and then spend the next twelve hours stuck in traffic dreaming of flying cars But habits are changing and so is the city walking cycling and taking the bus have never been easier Here s a guide to the best ways to get around ReykjavÃ k Advertisement Getting around the city center is easy on foot Visitors staying solely in the city center may not notice the sprawling size of ReykjavÃ k The city center â from Old Harbour to the Hlemmur bus terminal â is less than three kilometers in length making it easy to explore by walking Buses travel up and down Hverfisgata street but it s best to wander Laugavegur â the main shopping street â on foot Rent an electric scooter for easy fun exploring Electric scooters are widely available for rent in ReykjavÃ k with four different companies operating some vehicles for by the minute rental Expect to pay around Krona US for rides within the downtown area Helmets are harder to find however and legally riders aged or younger have to wear one if you have a cycle helmet at home bring it with you StrÃ buses are a great way to get around the metropolitan area ReykjavÃ kâ s public transport system is yellow on the outside and green on the inside the city s brightly colored StrÃ buses increasingly run on the cityâ s renewable electric energy supply The worst thing about catching the bus is standing still outside waiting in the elements but hang in there At peak operating times buses arrive every minutes but in the middle of the day and during the evening frequency drops to every minutes Service stops around midnight and resumes around on weekdays Sunday services are considerably less frequent The City of ReykjavÃ k is one of five municipalities making up the urban sprawl known as the Capital Region Altogether about of Icelandâ s population live in the area and the bus routes operated by StrÃ cover the entire metropolitan area Buses no longer accept cash or bank cards on board riders have to pay with special KLAPP tickets Most riders use their smartphones as a bus pass via the KLAPP app but prepaid cards are also available from eighteen vendors in ReykjavÃ k Rides cost Krona US valid for minutes in transit Children under the age of twelve travel for free and bicycles are allowed on board unless space is limited Advertisement While ReykjavÃ k sprawls for miles the central area is surprisingly compact Â StockWithMe Shutterstock A ReykjavÃ k city card gets you onto buses and into museums and swimming pools For those visiting for just a few days and looking for savings the ReykjavÃ k City Card is available for one two or three days The card is essentially an unlimited bus pass with generous perks including free access to twelve museums and exhibitions and the city s lively public swimming pools The hour option costs Krona US or the equivalent of nine bus tickets Rideshare services are illegal use a taxi instead First off do not attempt to call an Uber Ride hailing services are illegal due to a license quota system in Iceland intended to support job security among taxi drivers The two main taxi companies are Hreyfill and BSR Expect to pay at least Krona US for a taxi from the center of ReykjavÃ k to Keflavik airport Car sharing is a great alternative for driving around the city There are some handy car sharing companies with hourly rates for vehicles such as Zipcar and a new service from Hopp set to launch later in With stations throughout the city these cars are largely aimed at locals seeking to move groceries or other items within city limits a regular rental car is generally a better option for day trips out of ReykjavÃ k Looking for parking in ReykjavÃ k Just head to the parking garage at the Harpa Concert Hall Â KeongDaGreat Shutterstock Rent a car for easy day trips or to get further afield When booking a rental car for exploring Iceland note that KeflavÃ k International Airport is an hour by bus from ReykjavÃ k Picking up your hire car by the airport or in the nearby town of KeflavÃ k is much more convenient than doing so in ReykjavÃ k From July and August book hire cars well in advance Traveling around the capital by car it s best to avoid the morning rush hour from to and the afternoon rush hour from to This of course depends on direction â traffic heads into the city in the morning and out to the suburbs in the afternoon Where to park in ReykjavÃ k Parking a car on the street may seem like an impossible task but fear not â the capital has a network of multi level parking garages and a website showing by the minute availability The largest garages are at and close to the Harpa Concert Hall Expect to pay around Krona US per hour Bikes are handy for exploring the coast A series of shared use paths â designed for both cyclists and pedestrians â connect the inlets of the Capital Region by threading along the coastline running all the way from the tip of the Seltjarnarnes peninsula to downtown HafnarfjÃ rÃ ur Following these paths is not just a shortcut but a great way to recharge in an environment free of cars To rent bikes long or short term the two main downtown options are ReykjavÃ k Bike Tours by the Old Harbour and at Hverfisgata Street The city s largest bike store is Ã rninn in southeast ReykjavÃ k used bikes are largely traded via Facebook marketplaces such as til sÃ lu which counts one fifth of Iceland s population as members Handy cycle paths run along the shoreline of ReykjavÃ k and the Capital Region Â Nuerobite Getty Images â Why bicycles are my favorite way to travel By Nordic standards ReykjavÃ k is hardly a city of cyclists Blame the wind â statistics cannot explain how often it blows in the opposite direction to the way you are riding Always I tell you always But major improvements to bike paths led by Mayor Dagur Eggertsson known for showing up to meetings with world famous leaders with a bike helmet in tow have made cycling a serious alternative to cars and traffic jams Electric bikes are another revolution for year round cycling Beating the wind with a motor makes it easier to estimate travel times and means you ll be less likely to arrive dripping in sweat Over winter most cyclists use stud tires for safety For fun I like to cycle the ElliÃ aÃ rdalur the cityâ s largest public park For an extra stretch continue onwards to the hills of RauÃ and loop the outskirts by traveling along Lake RauÃ avatn â or wait for the bus back to the center Advertisement
