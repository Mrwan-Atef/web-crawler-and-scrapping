Türkiye of bubbles The quality of taste and service is high the products are diverse the rooms are comfortable The staff is generally courteous The flavors are diverse and delicious The product quality is high especially the drink options are very good Cuisine restaurant is excellent in terms of taste atmosphere and service special thanks to Mustafa Okçu Wi fi is very fast the signal is strong Cleaning the room twice a day renewing towels in the evening and taking out the garbage increases the cleanliness and comfort of the room The Assist application is very useful your needs that you write via Whatsapp are met within a few minutes We especially thank Mehmet Yılmaz Also thanks to the macro photography staff Especially in the main restaurant and the pool congestion may occur in the narrow space due to crowding Facilities should be provided for baby strollers and disabled strollers Long waits for the elevator during busy times and meal times Getting a seat by the pool is a problem The sea is pebbly and gets deeper after a short distance It is necessary to know how to swim well to enter when it is wavy You can enter with your child when the wind is from the land and there are no waves Room cleaning could be quick but more attentive There is a lot of noise in the corridor during cleaning your baby may wake up Sea facing rooms are noisy for guests with babies fortunately the balcony door provides quite a bit of insulation A desk is required in the room It is strange that à la carte restaurants are completely paid and not even free rights are given depending on the number of nights stayed In the Belek heat even with a fan the open air concept of an Italian restaurant is not very good Also the flavors in the Italian restaurant do not meet expectations We ve had better pizza and risotto The pancake buffet is well below expectations in terms of both service and taste Read more Date of stay August of bubbles Value of bubbles Location of

each of them for their help in all matters Rooms are spacious with dressing room coffee machine Nespresso capsules replenish every day pieces cosmetics Oxytan pasta Marvis bathrobes soft but slippers nasty synthetic The hairdryer is not from the wall but very weak who needs to take yours better Cleaning daily The launch is smooth sandy there is a panton the launch from it to the chest very comfortable Drinks and snacks can be enjoyed on the beach by quarkode There is a hour restaurant The food is very good There s a sweet shop everything s delicious The only downside is a la carte restaurants They are very weak and not worth their money at all Especially in a Japanese restaurant for euros per person when rolls were brought in inside of which are tuna from cans and in others crab sticks Although at lunch the buffet stood just like these and no one took them because it is a pathetic travesty The chefs have no connection to Japan and apparently have never been to a Japanese restaurant Disappointment They don t make much sense The buffet is much better and the choice is large Max Royal stands next door you can visit him if you want to see him because the owner is alone Voyage territory isn t very big but it s comfortable don t get lost The animation is not intrusive you can always find a quiet place without music There s an adult area no kids allowed in It is a pier

Read an AI generated summary of recent traveler reviews Take me there wrote a review Aug Prague Czech Republic of bubbles Our holiday July July Hey everyone We stayed at this hotel from July to July The hotel area is green and beautiful fragrant pine needles at every step We stayed in a villa with access to the pool The interior is cool the beds and pillows are very comfortable they brought us fresh fruit every morning replenished the minibar and changed towels twice a day Attentive staff to requests There are restaurants on site for an entrance fee but the food at all restaurants is delicious The waiters are super cool always trying to help in choosing a dish The sea was amazing especially clean sand and a wonderful entrance to the water On the beach there are pavilions for children on one side and pavilions for on the other side We booked a pavilion with children for five days and there is also a Qr Code for delivering food to it Two assistants Kamila and Özlem were assigned to our family the girls were always in touch and always tried to help us Special thanks to the assistants Another big plus was that having informed the reception that our flight had changed to in the evening and our individual transfer would only be at we were offered another room before that time for an additional fee it was great But unfortunately there are some minor drawbacks this is a crashing Internet which logged out of the system every minutes operating hours of the pavilion Well in principle how many people so many opinions Read more Date of stay July of bubbles Value of

beautiful vacation in Voyage from September Enjoyed everything from individual airport transfers the hotel welcomes champagne Russian speaking receptionists explain in detail immediately add to vatsap chat and conduct a tour of the hotel The area is very large drowned in green We took them to the main restaurant for breakfast the room was ready to be reported to the vatsap Checked into a storey Bungalow on the floor a large bed a sofa for a year old child and a chest cradle Special thanks to our assistants in the vatsap Irina and Sairagul helped to solve problems very quickly On the first day they asked us to change the room to the floor because with the stroller not very comfortable up the stairs the girls decided everything instantly and we were moved Also when needed medication ordered to us and delivered to the hotel Celebrated good cleaning in the evening brought in a set of dry towels was always handy The buffet is very decent everyone can choose to their liking For lunch always delicious soups fresh fried fish dinners for all tastes and Italian and Japanese Chinese Russian Turkish Thanks to Chef Murat by mouth From the restaurants Ala Carte liked Italian There is a wonderful cafe cake shop with a variety of desserts and ice cream The beach is clean well maintained Part of the sunbeds on the grass part on the sand there are also boars for an additional fee Used the services of the spa center the massage is very good We went to the already traditional photo shoot at the end of the holiday photographer Ilona spent everything quickly took many wonderful shots For children there is a lot of entertainment for any age kids club water park playgrounds play center moon park The hotel also has an adult area a separate restaurant a swimming pool and a beach area

a review Mar of bubbles Holidays in March at the Voyage Hotel Belek We stayed at the Voyage Belek Golf and Spa hotel from February to March Every year we try to escape to the sea at the end of winter to bask in the sun Despite the fact that it was low season the hotel had many activities every day sporting events archery darts volleyball bocce etc evening concerts musical bands dance shows magic shows etc d Upon check in we were assigned personal assistants who quickly resolved any personal issues asked us to bring a child s step and a potty and sent us a schedule of all events for the day every morning For us it was Melissa Kandemir and Leila Mehdiyeva It s much easier when there are people Russian speaking in constant contact who are ready to help and explain something The weather at the beginning of March is changeable one day turned out to be rainy and we enjoyed spending it without leaving the hotel Again the events inside hour restaurants and bars a heated swimming pool saunas steam baths and hammam saved the situation And also a great Kids club Very nice girls conduct several master classes every day for children of different ages Our three year old child refused to leave there he constantly rode down the slide put together puzzles played board games watched cartoons and much more Many thanks to every girl from the children s club We were delighted with the variety of desserts in the confectionery The cakes of all kinds of colors and shapes were incredibly delicious we tried different ones every day I was also surprised by the handmade chocolate it was also incredibly tasty The room was cleaned not just every day but sometimes times a day I accidentally noticed while going into the room to get something that the bed was perfectly made the clothes left behind were folded the trash was thrown out the towels were straightened In my opinion this is even too much It s great to relax at the hotel but there were some things we didn t like It seemed inconvenient to constantly move from building to building for breakfast lunch dinner and other events There was a little confusion with the elevators in different buildings floors start at etc Well the main disappointment was that during our visit the children s Luna Park was not open We chose the hotel itself precisely because of its availability and no one informed us that it was closed Our disappointment on the day of arrival when we approached the fence in front of this park cannot be expressed in words Overall the holiday went very well we basked in the sun played games and ate delicious food in restaurants The service at the hotel is of very high quality If you choose this hotel find out in advance whether everything is open on the required dates Have a nice holiday

this year This is the first hotel in Turkey we re going to for the second time The summer concept is not only more expensive but richer And it s not just about breakfast caviar it s about not getting around everything The hotel always has Russian speaking staff in every bar and restaurant The personal manager service works clearly Solve problems once and at our convenience A swanky Turkish breakfast a la carte out of abundance I just want to ask if Turks eat so much for breakfast Extraordinarily atmospheric steak restaurant a la carte very stylish and delicious We were so full we were out of power The selection of steaks is amazing Helpful waiters We really liked the restaurant which is open hours The chef of this restaurant is very happy for his restaurant wondering what the soul wishes if the waiters are busy he serves the holidaymakers himself We were reminded that you can have sandwiches on the road before you check out at their restaurant Very caring everyone in this restaurant Wonderful Mexican restaurant opens by day on a menu without reservations very calm few people and delicious Coffee house is beyond praise Alina will always smile and make you a fragrant coffee or tea We loved this location There are two sunbed areas on the beach on the grass and on the sand we liked to sunbathe where the grass is There were sunbeds on the pier too and sunbeds could be found at any time Bars and snack bar on the beach are all clear I liked fruit bar strawberry watermelon melon conveniently sliced cool The bathroom on the beach is clear the cleaning officer was always washing something rubbing it like she wouldn t come in there We lived in A Block and the nightly shows didn t bother us it was quiet and quiet in the evening the soundproofing in the rooms is great The hotel is wonderful Highly recommended When checking out if you check out after renting out your room there is a comfort area with shower safe It s all thought out Thank you Read more

with excellent service I liked the hotel but a lot depends on which room you live in We lived in the main right building if you face the sea in room with a beautiful view of the sea but if you live in a room with a different bed arrangement against the other wall then lying on it you will only be able to see the building opposite If you live in the same building but in odd numbers then the windows will face the other side and there will be noise from communications as a vacationer who lived there told us then they changed his room Building A is located behind the main building and in my opinion it is better to pay extra but live in the main building but this is a matter of taste Pros modern beautiful hotel design beautiful area although not huge Russian speaking hotel managers are constantly in touch with you via WhatsApp who will promptly resolve any issue friendly staff and generally good service heated swimming pool there are entertainment programs it s convenient that some of the sun loungers are on the artificial lawn and some are on the sand convenient QR code system for ordering drinks on the beach high quality and varied food with aesthetic presentation display quality drinks there are tennis courts the quality of the surface is normal Didn t quite like it strange location of the shower compartment in the room because to step on a dry towel after a shower you need to put it on the floor in the hallway essentially get out of the shower this is not entirely convenient the curtains in the room were a little wrinkled with a stain at the bottom of one of them and were significantly higher than the floor does not really affect the quality of your stay but in general it s strange that this exists iron and ironing board only upon request but then they are not taken away during the entire stay at the hotel at first they gave an iron with a chipped surface but then it was replaced we went on a bike tour but where you pick up the bikes there is no wrench to change the seat inclination in theory tools should be available Overall the hotel left a pleasant impression and can be recommended for a visit When asked if we would come there again the answer is yes Read

We rested in Voyage from March Generally rested well but with a little nuance If you go to a hotel without expecting it to be premium then the hotel is great As already written above welcome drinks no one offered although they were available of course Registration was quick and two assistants were assigned to Karina and Anatoly There are no questions about the assistants work all wishes were fulfilled quickly apparently once in the correspondence missed a message from her husband but wrote repeatedly and immediately everything was done It was very impressive that when we needed the nose spray from the pharmacy the assistant informed us that the nearest pharmacy was in Belek but we could order through them I thought well we ll order it probably the next day What was my surprise when our order arrived half an hour later That s awesome Well done great thanks for that In general there are no questions for all staff try waiters come up before you have time to sit down and sometimes you have to wait for an order in principle uncritically I only wish at breakfast to be able to pour myself tea or sometimes I ve already eaten and tea is still not available Personally we have questions only about cleaning immediately upon check in we noticed that the surfaces are not wiped the mirrors are covered the glass on the balcony is in mudflows the doors are also dirty There was no desire to write to the assistants and call for cleaning because the real thing to do was clean up there were tired of the road decided to live with what to eat Floors cleaned well pastels changed and swans spun Cleaned the same whether tipped or not In terms of the purity of the questions a lot of course and in the children s play center chairs ask for cleaning to say the least glasses are almost always in flow As they wrote above Block A if overlooking Max Royal and the sea then noisily I don t know from what exactly whether it s kitchen hoods or something We sat on the balcony a couple of times the view is chic but the hum is constant The food is great the choice is not huge but there is everything you need the truth at the end of the holiday people added and at dinner at o clock was already empty in places especially where the meat Red fish are always available The spa is good the saunas the pool we liked it inside The street pool hasn t gone down I think the water s cool and people are like keels in a jar Bowling is also normal pass the time in the evening often the tracks fail and there are a lot of people you have to make an appointment in advance The main bar in the evening if you haven t had time to take a seat then go wait for something to clear up but at p m the evening show starts and most people disperse you can have tea safely Generally a good hotel depending on what expectations you have to go there and what mood you have We ll probably come back depending on the price and what other hotels will offer Read more Automatically translated Date of

hotel keeps the level of a good five The room was provided in building A on the m floor overlooking the sea fairly clean quiet everything needed was in the room cleaning is standard Not a bad choice on the buffet sweet shop chocolate bar but the quality is a little weaker than in the past Been to the restaurant a couple times good service But heavily watered down juices for breakfast a small selection of grilled vegetables a low standard of waiters in the main restaurant And very long service in the evening at the main bar I want to acknowledge the work of personal assistants the girls

Айрат Ш wrote a review Jul of bubbles Excellent family hotel with decent maintenance Pros The check in was beautiful arrived at in Antalya the hotels were at and we at already roomed We met very well at the reception realized that we were out of the way got drunk took the documents and without too much request immediately gave the keys to the room and sent for breakfast albeit on price check in at That is the reception level Great territory huge swimming pool with wet terrace children s area many bars The food is above all praise the chefs work on excellent the quality of food and drinks is very good alcohol of a decent level I note the Japanese restaurant the acting skills of the chef the polite and sympathetic attitude of the waiters The fish restaurant is very decent the food is very good The animation work is good it doesn t bother you it doesn t interfere but it s there and if you get bored there s always something to do The children s centre is excellent very large and divided into different age groups the staff are polite and do great work with children There is a play center for teenagers bowling alley billiards set top boxes vending machines Children are even taken to eat separately if you have left the child in control and it is time to eat the child will not stay hungry Sun loungers and umbrellas are large comfortable there are many of them in any part of the beach on grass on sand in tree planting VIP gazebos for any taste The staff of the girl from Kazakhstan are very responsive polite and adequate Made a late check out no problem by hours the day of departure was fully spent no suitcase problems thanks to the assistants There are downsides too Poor room cleaning constantly need to call assistants to fully clean the room and design a cosmetic set of shampoos lotions cotton discs etc The waiters at the main restaurant are very passive you have to find them and wait for them Read more Automatically translated Date of stay July Trip type Traveled
