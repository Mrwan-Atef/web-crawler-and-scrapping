your home base for the best experiences in Hungary Sponsored by Hungarian Tourism Agency Shaun Busuttil Mar min read Share No matter what kind of excursion youâ re looking for you can find it both within and beyond the city limits of Budapest Hungary Â Courtesy of Hungarian Tourism Agency You could easily spend a year in Budapest and barely scratch its surface but this dynamic Central European metropolis is only one jewel in the crown that is Hungary The city is a gilded symbol of Hungaryâ s proud history architectural prowess and unique identity but thereâ s even more to see and experience beyond the capital No matter what kind of excursion youâ re looking for you can find it both within and beyond the city limits Hereâ s some of our favorite experiences Best for Wellness and Rejuvenation Wellness and rejuvenation literally come with the territory in Hungary which sits atop a reservoir of thermal springs flowing into almost every town and region More than of these mineral rich springs can be found in Budapest alone where they deliver medicinal waters to bathhouses and spas such as the stunning Ottoman era Veli Bej Baths the Rudas Baths and of course the iconic SzÃ chenyi Baths Advertisement Venture beyond the capital and youâ ll experience thermal therapy with a more traditional twist NyÃ regyhÃ za an endearing spa town with a quaint creative spirit is the perfect launching point for explorations into the northeastern region of Szabolcs SzatmÃ r Bereg Here wellness and culture meet in a warm embrace amid the heart of Hungarian folk arts Embroidered cloth adorns shop windows and traditional music and dance reverberate through the pedestrianized center of NyÃ regyhÃ za For a taste of century village nostalgia take a walk through the highly educational and fun Open Air Museum then visit the bath complex where a restorative soak in the medicinal thermal waters might just turn back your biological clock For a taste of adventure kids can slip and slide their way through the nearby water park The Childrenâ s Railway is run by school aged conductors between and years old Â Courtesy of Hungarian Tourism Agency Best for Families Speaking of the little ones just a few miles from NyÃ regyhÃ za and set inside a acre almost untouched oak forest is NyÃ regyhÃ za Zoo This award winning zoo is home to more than animals from all over the world including endemic species such as bear and bison and more exotic species such as Sumatran tigers Komodo dragons and Indian rhinos The complex is also home to an oceanarium and activities and exhibits for kids Closer to Budapest the Childrenâ s Railway is a great way for families to spend a half day This narrow gauge railway spans seven miles chugging along a serpentine route through the rolling Buda Hills from SzÃ chenyihegy to HÅ vÃ svÃ lgy It passes through the forested wilds and picnic grounds of Normafa and even stops at JÃ noshegy â the highest point in Budapest at Except for the driver the show is run exclusively by school aged conductors between and years old making for a unique experience the entire family will enjoy in any season Advertisement Lake Balaton is Central Europeâ s largest freshwater lake and well worth the two hour train ride from Budapest Â Courtesy of Hungarian Tourism Agency Best for Adventurers For a more grown up excursion the mighty Lake Balaton is well worth the two hour train ride southwest from Budapest Youâ d be forgiven for thinking youâ ve somehow hit the Mediterranean coastline once Central Europeâ s largest freshwater lake rolls into view â it is that big But while you can easily spend a weekend or a week relaxing on its lapping shores Balaton is also ripe for adventure One of the best ways to explore this breathtakingly beautiful body of water is on two wheels If youâ re fit enough itâ s possible to cycle around the lake in a single day But itâ s far better to spread the mile route over several days three to five at least unravelling the mostly flat rural landscape at a pace where you can enjoy all it has to offer Along the way youâ ll see the vineyards that produce Hungaryâ s finest wines â including SzÃ szi Vineyard and PetrÃ nyi Winery â historic lakeside towns and of course the Tihany Peninsula with its Instagram worthy lavender fields famous abbey and thatched roof dwellings The clearly marked route known as Balatoni kÃ rÃºt features dedicated bike paths and quiet country roads and plenty of places to fuel up with carb heavy Hungarian specialties such as langos HÃ vÃ z is famous for being home to the worldâ s second largest curative thermal lake Â Courtesy of Hungarian Tourism Agency Lake Balaton also features dozens of hiking trails from easy day hikes to multi day explorations With its towering pine forests ancient ruins and geyser cones the wild and rugged geological wonderland of Tihany Peninsula is the perfect spot to go trekking Look for the Echo Trail which can be done in a day and in any season For a look at Hungaryâ s fascinating geological and biological diversity the Badacsony area on the lakeâ s northern shore is equally stunning Forested trails run past petrified basalt columns and unique flora and fauna reaching their climax at lookout points over a patchwork of verdant vineyards such as Csendes DÅ lÅ Wine Estate Protruding from the horizon the foot massif that gives the region its name is a reminder of Hungaryâ s volcanic past There are several restaurants and bars en route where you can try a couple of glasses of the regionâ s excellent dry white wines for yourself such as Laposa Birtok At the western edge of the lake close to the historic town of Keszthely and its gorgeous Baroque style Festetics Palace lies HÃ vÃ z â famous for its curative thermal lake the worldâ s second largest and an array of health and rejuvenation services Relax away the bumps from the road with massages scrubs and other thermal remedies Tokaj is recognized for its role in
