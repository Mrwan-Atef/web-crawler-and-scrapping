empire This often overlooked Spanish city is so rich in ancient treasures skeletons of fifth century looters were found amid its ruins By Robin Catalano December min read At its peak in the first century A D the Roman Empire covered portions of three continents stretching north from the United Kingdom south to Egypt east to Syria and west to Portugal Of the plus sites archaeologists know about few offer a more complete and complex view of ancient Roman life than the remnants of Augusta Emerita located in modern day Mérida Spain The UNESCO World Heritage site lies in Spain s southwestern autonomous community of Extremadura a largely rural region best known for sun parched summers dry farmed crops and the production of Iberian ham What Mérida lacks in name recognition it s rarely spoken of in the same breath as Rome or Pompeii it makes up for in its range of Roman structures Sprinkled around acres within the modern city are all the defining elements of an ancient metropolis

National Museum of Roman Art An impressive restoration of the ancient city s largest house and a continuing focus on balancing tourism and historic conservation means travelers have new reasons to explore one of Spain s oldest settlements A Roman capital rises and falls Augusta Emerita was founded in B C by the Roman emperor Augustus as a colony for soldiers or emeriti discharged during the Cantabrian War The location near the Guadiana River was ideal in a valley between sloping forests and fields of encina trees the bark of which has long been used to produce cork Augustus named Mérida the capital of Lusitania a province that straddled the current day borders of Portugal and Spain It also became the center of the imperial cult that worshipped emperors as gods Evidence of the Roman rulers as deities movement include a veiled bust of Augustus as the Pontifex Maximus or supreme religious authority at the National Museum of Roman Art and the misnamed Temple of Diana in the city center The latter most likely erected during the reign of Augustus is actually an Imperial Cult Temple which rises from a tall granite podium its crumbling tympanum pointing skyward Buried by Vesuvius this Roman villa is a less visited alternative to Pompeii At its height in the first and second centuries Mérida attracted a population of from as far as Asia Minor It remained a strategic bastion and administrative capital up to the eighth century Moorish occupation But by the time of the Christian reconquest in the century the city was a historical footnote Many of its immoral structures were backfilled to make way for farming and new construction Plenty of other Roman sites exist outside of Italy including in neighboring Portugal Morocco and France In them you may have an amphitheater or baths or an aqueduct says Marco Mangut an Extremadura tour guide But finding a theater amphitheater and circus the top three buildings for games is extremely rare except in Rome Ancient meets modern The notable ancient structures of Mérida Spain s least populated and least visited region have been relatively easy to unearth If you go to Rome the difference between the modern ground level and the ancient is about meters In Mérida it s not even half that You could open a trench for a new fiber optic cable and hit some Roman ruins says Jonathan Edmondson professor of Roman history and classical studies at York University in Toronto and coauthor of Si muero no me olvides When I Die Do Not Forget Me which examines the social life of Augusta Emerita via funerary epigraphs Within the modern city visitors will stumble upon more than monuments from Roman to Christian all managed by the Consortium of the Monumental City of Mérida Regular archaeological finds and preservation projects mean there s always something new to see A mosaic at the National Museum of Roman Art shows the god Zeus as a bull abducting Europa Photograph by Age of Stock Alamy Stock Photo The dining room at the

foot fully accessible steel pathway winds just above the structure with glass floored platforms positioned over hallways and living spaces The project also erected a roof to protect the house from the intense Extremadura sun The Amphitheater House represents one of the most unique examples of Roman suburban dwellings that dotted the landscape surrounding the walls of Augusta Emerita says the Consortium s Raquel Nodar Becerra who oversaw the restoration with architect María López The largest Roman home in the city the Amphitheater House holds square feet of faded polychrome mosaics depicting gods nature and everyday life The best preserved ones decorate the dining room floor with scenes of Venus and Cupid framed by lush vegetation and a trio of men stomping grapes as little birds pluck at vines Uncover the secrets of London s Roman road These stone mosaics aren t just decorative they provide clues about who lived here and what they were like an Augustinian Architectural Digest of sorts In the Mithraeum House half a mile from the Amphitheater House the brightly colored Cosmological Mosaic uses mythological figures to show the celestial earthly and marine realms and their elements such as wind and water It suggests the owner of that house had some pretty interesting intellectual interests Edmondson says The grounds of the Alcazaba a ninth century Moorish fortress in Mérida feature Roman mosaics Photograph by DeAgostini Getty Images Mérida s Roman Theater and Amphitheater the second leg of a triangle formed with the Amphitheater House are also impressively preserved The Amphitheater s stone benches some eroded with age surround an arena where gladiators battled The theater has a columned proscenium that was once decorated with sculptures and a three tiered seating system for the city s different social classes According to Mangut the columns were so prized that archaeologists in the early unearthed the skeletons of fifth century looters hands clutching ropes affixed to their fallen prizes who were trapped when the ceiling collapsed On the third leg of the triangle is the National Museum of Roman Art where classically inspired arcades with tall arches hold interpretive exhibits on Roman culture and about artifacts of a collection of These include glass coins and a large stone medallion featuring the head of Medusa Nearby the city s massive Circus held spectators for ceremonial processions and chariot races including some featuring Gaius Appuleius Diocles Over a two decade career the charioteer earned the equivalent of billion in modern day U S dollars making him the highest paid athlete of all time From the Circus it s a short walk to three of the four aqueducts that routed water from nearby springs and reservoirs to supply the entire city The foot tall Miracles Aqueduct is the best preserved with graceful arcs of granite ashlars bricks and concrete that stretch for half a mile Around the river bend the Roman Bridge

stretch of Roman wall in the city plus an urban layout featuring houses and streets Preserving the past looking to the future The sustainable modern use of these ancient spaces along with their conservation and study are the primary objectives and challenges for Mérida today The Roman Theater for example is home to the summer International Festival of Classical Theater where well known Spanish actors mount productions of Greek and Roman classics The Amphitheater is the backdrop for annual Catholic Holy Week ceremonies For Emerita Lvdica a fall historical reenactment on steroids local performers and residents dress in Roman costume and recreate scenes from daily life including gladiatorial games funerals and markets selling crafts and food Visit this lesser known Spanish region for fantastic scenery and food Events such as these as well as everyday tourism bring in much needed funds for preservation work while simultaneously creating wear and tear on the structures a catch of the conservation world that isn t limited to Mérida Environmental damage is also a concern from extreme weather events to the growth of biofilms and lichens which can degrade stone And there s still an ancient city sleeping beneath the modern one Whenever new construction is undertaken in Mérida the Consortium s archaeologists are on hand to document any ruins found The goal is to launch an interactive digital map of the city where visitors can tap on a building or street and learn about its Roman past Once documented the ancient structures are sometimes integrated into urban life as is the case for two apartment buildings whose basements preserve behind glass walls their ancient foundations Other findings such as a Roman mosaic unearthed during work on a busy modern street have been re covered a poignant illustration of the unremitting forward march of time and the human desire for remembrance Mérida s residents take it in stride We understand that the city should go on says Mangut While we would love for everything to be visible forever it is impossible It s really amazing to have a city that s so alive where there are brand new discoveries made every year We are trying to coexist between Roman preservation and new life Robin Catalano is a Hudson Valley based travel writer who specializes in the Northeast U S Follow her on Instagram and Twitter Related Topics ANCIENT
