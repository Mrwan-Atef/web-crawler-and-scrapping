of some temples World Heritage listed Prambanan is Indonesia s largest Hindu site and one of Southeast Asia s major attractions The highlight is the central compound where eight main and eight minor temples are assembled on a raised platform an architectural crescendo of carved masonry and staircases the high note of which is Candi Shiva Mahadeva Prambanan sits within a large park dotted with lesser temples a day is needed to do the site justice Extended over two centuries building at Prambanan commenced in the middle of the century around years after Borobudur Little else is known about the early history of this temple complex although it s thought that it may have been built by Rakai Pikatan to commemorate the return of a Hindu dynasty to sole power in Java The whole Prambanan Plain was abandoned when the Hindu Javanese kings moved to East Java and in the middle of the century a great earthquake toppled many of the temples Prambanan remained in ruins for years its demise accelerated by treasure hunters and locals searching for building materials While efforts were made in to clear the site it was not until that reconstruction was first attempted Most temples have now been restored to some extent and like Borobudur Prambanan was listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site in Prambanan suffered extensive damage in the earthquake Although the main temples survived hundreds of stone blocks collapsed or were cracked blocks in the Shiva temple alone Today the main structures have been restored but a lot of work remains to be done and parts of the complex are still off limits In the main courtyard Candi Shiva Mahadeva dedicated to Shiva is not only the largest of the temples but also the finest The main spire soars high and the temple is lavishly carved The medallions that decorate its base have a characteristic Prambanan motif small lions in niches flanked by kalpatura trees of heaven and a menagerie of stylised half human half bird kinnara heavenly beings The vibrant scenes carved onto the inner wall of the gallery encircling the temple are from the Ramayana they tell how Lord Rama s wife Sita is abducted and how Hanuman the monkey god and Sugriwa the white monkey general eventually find and release her The temple s interior comprises a main chamber at the top of the eastern stairway with a four armed statue of Shiva the Destroyer The statue is notable for the fact that this mightiest of Hindu gods stands on a huge lotus pedestal a symbol of Buddhism In the southern cell is the potbellied and bearded Agastya an incarnation of Shiva as divine teacher in the western cell is a superb image of the elephant headed Ganesha Shiva s son and the god of knowledge Ganesha s right hand usually holding his ivory tusk was broken off in the earthquake In the northern cell Durga Shiva s consort can be seen killing the demon buffalo Some people believe that the Durga image is actually an image of the Slender Virgin who legend has it was turned to stone by a man she refused to marry She is still an object of pilgrimage and her name is often used for the temple group Candi Vishnu touches and sits just north of Candi Shiva Mahadeva The temple s impressive reliefs tell the story of Lord Krishna a hero of the Mahabharata epic while a four armed image of Vishnu the Preserver crowns the inner sanctum Candi Brahma is Candi Vishnu s twin temple South of Candi Shiva Mahadeva it is carved with the final scenes of the Ramayana The spectacular mouth doorway is noteworthy and the inner chamber contains a four headed statue of Brahma the god of creation The park surrounding Prambanan contains a number of lesser known temples including the Buddhist temple Candi Sewu Dating from around AD it comprises dozens of outer shrines decorated with stupas Originally it was surrounded by four rings of smaller guard temples leading to its name Thousand Temples Outside the compound stood four sanctuaries at the points of the compass of which Candi Bubrah now reduced to its stone foundation is the most southern The renovated main temple has finely carved niches around the inner gallery which would once have held bronze statues To reach
