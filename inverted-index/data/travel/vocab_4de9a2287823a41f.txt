important to pack a carry on with what you might need both on the plane and on your first and last hours on board your cruise ship Needless to say you ll have time to put your last day s clothing aside on the evening before you dock but it s just as important to have your toiletries and a few other things you might need to freshen up in case your bags don t arrive It s not a bad idea to include a change of clothing for dinner on the first night Essentials for Your Carry on passport money documents and keys extra glasses contact lens supplies mouthwash and dental floss shampoo and conditioner if you want your own brand shaving kit hat or cap small flashlight and nightlight body and hand lotions sunscreen brushes combs and hair spray curling iron feminine hygiene products notebook and pen cable ties folding tote bag or waist pack swimwear camera film or memory cards and extra batteries reading glasses if you use them toothbrush and toothpaste deodorant sunglasses

Packing Strategies Once you know what you want to put into your bag consider these strategies to streamline your packing efforts Stick to the List Personalize the packing list and stick with it Pack and Tick Assemble everything on the list before starting to pack and check items off when they re placed in the suitcase Eliminate the Extras Resist the urge to toss in something just in case that s the item you surely won t need Take Tiny Toiletries Plan ahead and shop for sample or small size containers of favorite toiletries Wash on the Go If the ship has self service laundry facilities you can opt to pack lighter and wash clothes midway through the cruise or bring along some laundry detergent so that you can wash some items in your bathroom sink in a pinch Prepare to Expand A collapsible tote bag is handy as a shopping or beach bag and invaluable when it s time to pack the souvenirs that are preventing your suitcase from closing on the return trip Cross Pack Consider cross packing your luggage with your travel companion Chances are if a suitcase is missing it ll turn up eventually In the meantime you ll both have fresh clothing until it does Guard Your Valuables Valuables should never be packed in your checked luggage Jewelry medicine cameras and travel documents belong in your carry on For safety and peace of mind consider carrying cash cards and your passport in a money pouch under your clothing Lock it Up Lock your checked luggage with TSA approved locks for peace of mind Keep Luggage in Check Cruisers arriving at their embarkation port by air should be aware of airline restrictions on luggage size and weight policies to avoid any rude and expensive surprises Cruise lines too while not as strict also have their own luggage restrictions so be sure to verify in advance that the luggage you bring aboard is within their stated limits previous Paying for Things on Board and Tipping next Lifestyle and Special Interest Cruises Cruise Best
