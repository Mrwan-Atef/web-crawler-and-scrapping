The road to Acadia National Park s Cadillac Mountain Jon Bilous Shutterstock Packed with vistas of rocky shores picturesque lighthouses and tranquil forests a drive through Acadia National Park may be the most beautiful island road trip in America especially during a New England summer This driving route swoops up Cadillac Mountain and rolls past cliffs on Mt Desert Island through and beyond the Park Loop Rd Weâ ve included where to pull over and how to get to the next stop â but be sure to explore on foot and by bike wherever you can Be mindful that due to staffing cuts the National Park Service is stretched this year Travelers can expect longer wait times fewer services and the potential closures of certain areas Stay prepared with this guide Duration days Distance miles Best time to go May through October for good weather and open facilities Advertisement Shuttles With millions of visitors coming to the park each summer traffic and parking can be a hassle If you prefer to leave the driving to someone else on arrival drive the Park Loop Rd straight through for the views and the driving experience Then get around via the Island Explorer which is free with park admission for the remainder of the trip Shuttles run along routes that connect visitors to trails carriage roads beaches campgrounds and in town destinations They can even carry mountain bikes Start Hulls Cove Visitor Center Before zooming into Bar Harbor on ME stop at the park visitor center to get the lay of the land and pay the admission fee Inside head directly to the large diorama which provides a helpful overview of Mount Desert Island MDI From the visitor center the best initiation to the park is to drive the mile Park Loop Rd which links the parkâ s highlights in the eastern section of MDI Itâ s one way traveling clockwise for most of its length The drive From the visitor center turn right onto the Park Loop Rd not ME which leads into Bar Harbor Take in a nice view of Frenchman Bay on your left before passing the spur to ME A short distance ahead turn left to begin the one way loop on the Park Loop Rd Stop Sieur de Monts Spring Nature lovers and history buffs will enjoy a stop at the Sieur de Monts Spring area at the intersection of ME and the Park Loop Rd Here youâ ll find a nature center and the summer only branch of the Abbe Museum which sits in a lush nature like setting Twelve of Acadiaâ s biospheres are displayed in miniature at the Wild Gardens of Acadia from bog to coniferous woods to meadow Botany enthusiasts will appreciate the plant labels There are also some amazing stone step trails here appearing out of the talus as if by magic The drive If you wish to avoid driving the full park loop follow ME from here into Bar Harbor Push on for the full experience â you wonâ t regret it Precipice Trail Acadia National Park Shoshana Weissmann Shutterstock Stop Precipice Trail Whatâ s the most exciting way to get a birdâ s eye view of the park By climbing up to where the birds are Two ladder trails cling to the sides of exposed cliffs on the northeastern section of the Park Loop Rd dubbed Ocean Dr If youâ re fit and the seasonâ s right tackle the first of the ladder trails the steep challenging mile Precipice Trail which climbs the east face of Champlain Mountain on iron rungs and ladders It truly is a challenging hike so make sure youÊ ve got plenty of water and everyone in your group can handle the steeps and ladder rung climbs Note that the trail is typically closed from late spring to mid August because itâ s a nesting area for peregrine falcons If itâ s closed you might catch volunteers and staff monitoring the birds through scopes from the trailhead parking lot The drive Continue south on the Park Loop Rd The Beehive Trail starts north of the Sand Beach parking area Stop Beehive Trail and Sand Beach Another challenging but rewarding ladder trail is the Beehive Trail The mile climb includes ladders rungs narrow wooden bridges and scrambling â with steep dropoffs As with the Precipice Trail itâ s recommended that you descend via a nearby walking route rather than climbing down Donâ t let the crowds keep you away from Sand Beach Itâ s home to one of the few sandy shorelines in the park You donâ t have to visit in the middle of the day to appreciate its charms beat the crowds early in the morning or visit at night especially for the Stars over Sand Beach program During these free one hour talks lie on the beach look up at the sky and listen to rangers share stories and science about the stars Even if you miss the talk the eastern coastline along Ocean Dr is worth checking out at night when you can watch the Milky Way slip right into the ocean Advertisement The drive Swoop south past the crashing waves of Thunder Hole If you want to exit the loop road turn right onto Otter Cliff Rd which hooks up to ME north into Bar Harbor Otherwise pass Otter Point then follow the road inland past Wildwood Stables The clear waters of Jordan Pond Paget Kidd Shutterstock Stop Jordan Pond House Share hiking stories with other nature lovers at the lodge like Jordan Pond House where afternoon tea has been a tradition since the late Steaming pots of Earl Grey come with hot popovers hollow rolls made with egg batter and strawberry jam Eat on the broad lawn overlooking the lake On clear days the glassy waters of the acre Jordan Pond reflect the image of Mt Penobscot like a mirror After finishing your tea take the mile nature trail around the pond Stay Harbourside Inn is a shingled summer cottage with homey antique furnished rooms and suites Many rooms have fireplaces and a number have kitchenettes For a more luxurious stay guests have been arriving at The Asticou Hotel since the days of steamer trunks and whalebone corsets Overlooking Northeast Harbor the grand main building has sunny rooms and European decor Thereâ s also a restaurant with sweeping views The drive From the pull off almost miles north of Jordan Pond House look up for the rock precariously perched atop South Bubble Continue north to access Cadillac Mountain Rd Sunset on Cadillac Summit Road Leelahope Photography Shutterstock Stop Cadillac Mountain Donâ t leave the park without driving â or hiking â to the summit of Cadillac Mountain For panoramic views of Frenchman Bay walk the paved mile Cadillac Mountain Summit loop The summit is a popular place in the early morning because itâ s long been touted as the first spot in the US to see the sunrise The truth It is but only between October and March The crown is passed to northern coastal towns the rest of the year because of the tilt of the earth But hey the sunset is always a good bet The drive Drunk on the views complete the loop road and exit the park heading for your accommodations or next destination But consider finding a parking lot to tackle walking trails or heading to Bar Harbor to hire bikes Stop Carriage Roads John D Rockefeller Jr a lover of old fashioned horse carriages gifted Acadia some miles of crisscrossing carriage roads Made from crushed stone the roads are free from cars and are popular with cyclists hikers and equestrians Several of them fan out from Jordan Pond House but if the lot is too crowded continue north to the parking area at Eagle Lake on US to link to the carriage road network If youâ re planning to explore by bike the Bicycle Express Shuttle runs to Eagle Lake from the Bar Harbor Village Green from late June through September Pick up a Carriage Road Userâ s Map at the visitor center The drive Keeping the scenic drive going before you head for the bright lights of Bar Harbor take a detour Drive ME toward the western part of MDI connecting to ME west then drop south on ME toward Southwest Harbor Pass Echo Lake Beach and Southwest Harbor then bear left onto ME for a dramatic rise up and back into the park near the seawall Historic landmark Bass Harbor Head Light in Mount Desert Island Jon Bilous Shutterstock Stop Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse There is only one lighthouse on Mount Desert Island and it sits in the somnolent village of Bass Harbor in the far southwest corner of the park Built in the lighthouse still has a Fresnel lens from Itâ s in a beautiful location thatâ s many photographersâ favorite The lighthouse is a Coast Guard residence so you canâ t go inside but you can take photos You can also walk to the coast on two easy trails near the property the Ship Harbor Trail a mile loop and the Wonderland Trail a mile roundtrip These trails are spectacular ways to get through the forest and to the coast which looks different from the coast on Ocean Dr The drive For a lollipop loop return on ME to ME through the village of Bass Harbor Follow ME then ME to Bar Harbor Bar Harbor Maine Cavan Images Shutterstock Stop Bar Harbor Tucked on the rugged coast in the shadows of Acadiaâ s mountains Bar Harbor is a busy gateway town with a J Crew joie de vivre Restaurants taverns and boutiques are scattered along Main St Mt Desert St and Cottage St Shops sell everything from books to camping gear to handicrafts and art For a fascinating collection of natural artifacts related to Maineâ s Native American heritage visit the Abbe Museum The collection holds more than objects such as pottery tools combs and fishing instruments spanning the last years including contemporary pieces Spend the rest of the afternoon or early evening exploring the area by water Sign up in Bar Harbor for a half day or sunset sea kayaking trip Both Maine State Kayak Tours and Coastal Kayaking Tours offer guided trips along the jagged coast Stay The Salt Cottages is a revamped old school motor lodge outfitted with simple chic design and Matouk linens It is a great option for families with a volleyball net game room outdoor pool and on site cafe If youÊ re super tuckered from a long active day in the park grab a six pack of GearyÊ s or a bottle of rosÃ and order takeout lobster rolls from Bar Harbor Lobster Bakes to eat at the picnic tables poolside The drive Thereâ s another part of the park you havenâ t yet explored Reaching it involves a mile drive north on Rte to US following it about miles to ME S ME passes through Winter Harbor and then links to Schoodic Point Loop Rd Itâ s about an hourâ s drive one way Alternatively hop on a Downeast Windjammer ferry from the pier beside the Bar Harbor Inn End Schoodic Peninsula The Schoodic Peninsula is the only section of Acadia National Park thatâ s part of the mainland Itâ s also home to the Schoodic Loop Rd a mostly one way rugged and woodsy drive with splendid views of Mount Desert Island and Cadillac Mountain Youâ re more likely to see a moose here than on MDI â what moose wants to cross a bridge Thereâ s an excellent campground near the entrance then a picnic area at Frazer Point Further along the loop turn right for a short ride to Schoodic Point a high promontory with ocean views The full loop from Winter Harbor is miles If youâ re planning to come by ferry you could rent a bike beforehand at Bar Harbor Bicycle Shop â the loop roadâ s smooth surface and easy hills make it ideal for cycling In July and August the Island Explorer Schoodic shuttle bus runs from Winter Harbor to the peninsula ferry terminal and around the Schoodic Loop Road It does not link to Bar Harbor This
